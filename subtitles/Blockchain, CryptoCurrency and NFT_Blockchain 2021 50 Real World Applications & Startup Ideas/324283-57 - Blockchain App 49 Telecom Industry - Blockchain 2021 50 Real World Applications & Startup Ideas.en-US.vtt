00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
Telecom plays a critical role in every aspect of our life.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.950
It affects every quadrant over life,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.150
the V,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.780
how we manage our business,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.920
the way we manage our day to day activities,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.370
The wavy stay in touch with our loved ones and the way we construct our collective human

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.750
experiences that we call culture.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.630
In simple words,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.050
you can say telecom is a way oflife.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.760
Telecom has played a crucial room in shaping not only of a society and culture,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.750
but it has also been instrumental in shaping the business and economics work as well.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.650
Telecom is a huge industry with its global market valued in trillions of dollars.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.050
But this industry is definitely not a cakewalk for the telecom operators who run this show

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.050
.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.810
They're being challenged by increasing costs and decreasing revenues,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.110
and on top of that,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.350
the our growing competition always keeps them on their toes.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.860
Today,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.800
these telecom operators are in dire needs of reducing costs,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.320
exploring and implementing new revenue generation streams,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.870
and made the little offerings more lucrative and competitive.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.570
That this industry is in a technological transformation face as it moves towards an amended

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.050
where to live and digitize environment.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.660
But they're Still,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.980
many loopholes in this industry that,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.550
on exist and blocked in technology has the potential to plug them in.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.820
Bloating.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.990
Technology has great applications for these communications service providers,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.090
or C s peace.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.750
In short,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.540
Blokhin can help the C s peace through cost production by the efficiencies on new value

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.350
offerings.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.950
Fraud is one of the biggest nightmares for most of these communications of his providers,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.560
according to a recent survey report.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.550
It has been estimated that four Dowland activities cost the service providers $38 billion.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.650
Most of the floors in this industry revolves around Romy,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.750
and identity management and looking based solutions have the potential who will use these

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.150
foods and thus close to the service providers.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.450
Next.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.150
First discuss about roaming fruit.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.470
Currently,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.580
when a subscriber places a call from the Roman territory,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.100
the partner Norman Network service provider,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.690
where is the whole service provider about the roaming services that use it has subscribed

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.950
to.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.330
After that call detail records are sent to the billing systems off the whole service

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.810
provided.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440
After receiving these records,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.640
the host service provider is required to settle their accounts with the roaming service

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.230
provider in accordance with the agreed.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.650
Applicable roaming tariffs?

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.190
No me thought when a user uses the roaming services off the roaming service provider and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.350
the host of this provider is unable to charge the user for the services rendered.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.330
But the hosts of this provider is liable to pay the roaming service provider for rendering

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.450
the Roman services.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.050
There are primarily two reasons that lead to roaming throats.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.750
The 1st 1 is the longer detection thing.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.300
Since roaming thought occurs when the subscriber is not in the home territory,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.700
it takes a longer time to detect the food Because of the delays in data exchange between

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.850
the host and the Roman service providers.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.620
The second causes the longer response time horse service provider,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.940
has no control over the systems we had.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.150
This photo takes place.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.310
Therefore,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.520
the time to respond to these Foreland cases is comparatively longer than the time taken to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.550
respond to 1/3 that has taken place in a system owned by the host service provided.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.350
Now let's discuss how Blockchain based solution can help to take a disarming fruit.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.050
A permission blocks in would be implemented between the operators having roaming agreement

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.050
.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.270
The roaming agreement between the service providers would be implemented as a smart

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.270
contract on the block to nettle whenever the user makes a call in the roaming network.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.480
The roaming service provider publishes the call detail records as a transaction on the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.770
block.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.160
PSINet.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.130
When this transaction is broadcast it on the Net.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.450
But Smart contract gets executed and the pre defined terms of the agreement are implemented

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.450
,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.790
the horse of his provider automatically calculates the building amount.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.300
Put that goal and send this information to the Romans service provider.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.730
The implementation of Blockchain and Smart contract assists,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.210
impromptu authorization and settlement in accordance with a pre a bit terms they find in

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.050
the smart country.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.400
No,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.730
let's discuss the second floor,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.120
that is,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.150
identity food Identity Thought happens when a particular subscriber uses a force

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.650
identification or some other subscribers.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.360
Identity.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.040
Who access that?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.150
Telecom services.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.860
There are cases they're improper.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.470
Identity proofs are submitted.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.920
The ideas provided have blood data,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.490
and that data is electable.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.260
But still,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.250
the ideas get approved without proper elevations.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.550
There is still no universal database to verify the customer details.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.540
Have you?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.680
Telecom operator maintains its own database off roads who identify the potential future

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.550
forests.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.630
These records are confined to the Individual Service Providers database,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.150
and they're not available for other service providers.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.250
This leaves inefficient identity for management system.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.710
Using Blockchain based system,

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.190
telecom providers can develop a solution for identity management that can be used across

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.140
various devices,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.450
applications and organizations.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.110
There are numerous application of coyote ranging from smart homes,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.180
smart cities,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.430
connected vehicles,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.730
smart entertainment,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.150
smile,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.050
executive etcetera and this list is bound to go further.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.950
It is estimated that by the year 2020 they would be around 200 billion connected devices.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.860
This could lead to an explosion off a huge amount of personal and professional data.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.980
Put these devices,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.050
which in turn can lead to an increase probability off hacking off these devices.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.000
Some of the biggest challenges in developing coyote devices are privacy,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.040
security,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.150
compatibility and connectivity.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.320
In the current ecosystem,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.230
Iot devices have a dependency on the Internet for any sort of communication with other

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.450
devices and a highly centralised.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.360
This lack of proper security measures,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.030
in turn,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.850
can leave them vulnerable to hacking.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.690
But with the implementation of Blockchain Hyoty systems,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.150
which are currently sent list will be replaced by decentralized legend,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.250
thus making it extremely secure against hacking activities.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.650
Processes like number portability and Billy can be streamlined using Blockchain technology

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.650
,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.140
telecom providers can verify number portability and billings without any hassle once this

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.350
distributed ledger technology is implement.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.100
In this scenario,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.200
a blocked in will be shared among all the delicate operators,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.940
customers and other players in the telecom industry,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.420
like value added service or vast providers,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.080
or whether top media providers like Netflix,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.490
Amazon,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.150
etcetera,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.020
many subscribers applies for number portability from one network to another.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.030
His request would be stored on the block.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.230
The telecom provider who receives the porting request from the customer can verify his

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.080
identity over the blocks in and once verified,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.170
he will be on board on the new telecom provider network that's making number portability

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.260
has every experience for the customs sim card or simply put,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.770
the lifeline of today's mobile ecosystem is facing extinction.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.850
With the introduction of Brockton Solutions,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.650
these solutions from Mr Deliver better and flexible services to customers.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.330
The hardware based tourist does evolve over time and many of them and digital.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.950
But the same technology didn't show any new technological development,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.750
and even today they were the same way as they were initially created this is bound to tea

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.180
into the implementation off Isam technology with blocked in every user will have a unique

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.650
and secure digital i D,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.150
which can be accessed by any service provider after taking do permission from the user.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.020
With the implementation off.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.610
Isn't technology a user?

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.140
Cantu's a voice plan from one service provider,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.270
Mobile data plan can be bought from a defense of his provider,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.870
and video streaming services can be bought from 1/3 service provider.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.220
They use it.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.090
We'll have the complete freedom to choose defense service bundles from defense of his

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.250
providers on an easy I D on the Blockchain accessible to all service providers.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.830
Google has become one of the first companies to deploy this technology,

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.650
and with the introduction of blocked in,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.250
this is bound respect to even by the markets.
