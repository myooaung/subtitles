00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
since the advent of physical to farmers have confronted unpredictable weather conditions.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.230
And there are times when their crops could destroy it because of natural calamities.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.650
And they're left knows also Finckel.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.650
This some things even need to monster states where farmers in many developing countries,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.670
the only way for farmers to protect themselves from these unfavourable weather conditions

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.350
and drop loss is suit crop insurance.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.860
It can cushion their loss of the destroyed drops.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.940
There's multiple crop insurance policies for farmers that they can avail to call for such

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.050
difficult times.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.150
But the biggest problem with these policies is the processing off insurance claims,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.640
which is a tedious and time consuming,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.230
does when the crops get destroyed and farmers are in dire need of the financial assistance

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.230
.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.550
What they get is lengthy anti GIs recesses instead of the Duke of it amount.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.630
The processing off insurance claims sometimes even takes use the need of the artist to help

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.300
these farmers and make their life easier.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.510
Then they're going through such difficult times blocked in technology and smart contracts,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.850
can radically improve the whole insurance claim process and can make the whole experience

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.880
seamless in the even often natural disaster when the crops get destroyed,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.650
the smart contrary will be triggered and payout for the victim.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.050
Farmers will be released automatically.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.260
Let us understand it to a sinner who a farmer border crop insurance in this new blocked in

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.250
powered system.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.970
Under this insurance policy,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.600
a smart contract gets a date upon by the farmer on the insurance company in the smart

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.200
contract,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.480
all the terms and clearly defined,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.950
under which the farmer will be eligible for the claim amount.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.950
One of the films is regarding the amount of the rainfall.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.250
If we train more than X sent me to and that for more than a week the farmer will be

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.710
eligible for the insurance claim during the rainy season.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.200
It trade heavily for more than 10 days and there were floats which destroyed the drops of

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.950
the Farmall.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.630
The material article station release the rainfall data for that region,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.550
which was above accented me too.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.940
As the rainfall was above the three different Trecia Liberte.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.950
The smart contract gets triggered and an automatic pale to the victim farmer is initiated.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.720
Does the farmer get very quiet resources and the financial assistance without going through

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.620
any hassle?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.050
Doing such a bad time,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.550
in fact,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.200
blocked in technology and I o.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.050
T can even help farmers to take preventive measures before the natural calamities strike

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.920
Preinstalled.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.620
Riotous senses can predict the unfavourable that the conditions like draught are heavy rain

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.150
form,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.850
and as soon as a pre decided conditions of the smart contract term it,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.620
it gets executed and the preventive drop insurance payout is automatically released to the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.350
farmers.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.650
This,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.400
in turn,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.150
would help farmers to take precautions before the natural disaster strikes,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.370
for example,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.410
in storing the harvested crops at appropriate places that these costs will not be affected

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.410
.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.150
But these natural calamities,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.050
this saving cost for the insurance company and avoiding damage to the farmer's crops.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.710
I can also help farmers in improving the Yudof their crops.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.200
I had the senses can be installed on the fields that will monitor the crop growth,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.720
harvesting and crop yield on the bloc.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.700
Team I descends.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.940
US installed can also help farmers in providing real time updates about the irrigation

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.110
needs off the crops,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.860
seed quality soil,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.750
much to man your fertiliser requirements and also about the disease drops.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.410
This information would become an invaluable resource for the farmer to maximize the crop

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.850
yield.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.650
Another talent faced by farmers is that they have to rely on the traders for selling the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.450
product who dictate order,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.150
prices and quantities.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.540
De statically results in low farmer income as farmers do not receive their due shoe,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.820
even though they're the most important part of the teen being the food produces blocked in

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.750
in helping establishing a direct link between farmers on consumers or retailers,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.940
it will involve a small farmers to organize themselves and get together to teach the market

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.550
without taking any help from the middle man.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.450
Today,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.190
the Agriculturists artist supply chain is notoriously complex and opaque as the product

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.150
since hands multiple times before eating their final destination.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.160
It is difficult for farmers to know ville and at what price the products are getting sold.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.950
Ultimately,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.860
this lack of information leaves them vulnerable and at the mercy of traders who dictate

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.200
order,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.310
prices and quantities through blocking,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.590
farmers will get transparency in the supply chain that's enabling them to get the fair

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.050
share for the produce.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.960
In the current scenario,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.400
consumers are always skeptical well,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.650
buying an organic food.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.040
There is no way to verify whether product label this organic really organic blocked in with

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.850
allowed 10 win organic food brands to stand out from the crowd.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.370
This is because the providence off these products can be easily traced,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.950
giving consumers confidence that they're getting added value from a high quality product.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.850
And it is hoping for such a high quality product.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:07.150
For though in the current system it often takes weeks for farmers to get paid for the goods

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.150
.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.910
But to the implementation of flocked in and smart contracts,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.510
premenstrual poetry good automatically as soon as the buyer conforms,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:22.330
acceptance of the product secure and former drop it is rates are important for the economic

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.480
development of humans.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.850
Will vote a lot of farmers velvet like access to land tightly and landing magician.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.050
Many farmers like legal ownership of the land they live and broken,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.050
and this lack of secure land ownership is the biggest cause of poverty.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.620
Land registry is a typical independent on paper,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.150
documents 100 signatures and man will able to resist a land titles.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.060
This land registry process is prone to fraud and corruption,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:02.230
and the poor farmers have to suffer a lot because of this few Fraught says you violence on

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.650
bribery to falsely claim the ownership off the lines of poor farmers.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:13.350
The land records get corrupted because off it who are farmers get no land or less land,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.250
and less land results in less income for them.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.690
Blocked in technology will be able to address many off these shortcomings and traditional

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.150
land registries as it provides an in your table method to register land titles.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:35.700
Does protecting the farmers from corruptions and Florence and a mere table and transparent

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.440
land record will also help farmers to resource any land disputes that may arise in the

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.050
future.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.340
For implementation of a blocked in based land registry process,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.850
the geo coordinates off land will be uniquely coded and recorded into the Blockchain.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.250
Each property would also be linked to a smarty,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.810
which would be held by the owner off that piece off land for the spot contracts.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.920
When combined with block to can be used to fasten the transfer of land indictment and other

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.250
related transactions.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:15.930
It will also empower farmers to get quick loans as they can easily prove their ownership of

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.610
the land,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.070
which is generally kept,

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.800
is a collection against the loan disposed across the globe.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.250
The agriculture sector is lastly dependent on government subsidies for education,

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.070
electricity,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.740
seeds,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.730
fertilizers,

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.510
etcetera.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.950
Were farmers get these facilities at a lower average.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.530
For instance,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.970
in India in 17 4018 budget,

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:47.040
a sum off approximately $4.9 billion was allocated for executive related subsidies to

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.750
farmers.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.350
But von question always remains unanswered.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:58.010
How much of this amount actually reaches these intended beneficiaries to a blocked in the

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.520
distribution on delivery of subsidies,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.870
then become more transparent as each transaction on the Blockchain is recorded in a

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:12.560
transparent and immutable fee for the for the implementation of blocked in these subsidies

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.350
can be targeted to the intended farmers.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:22.400
Thus we can compute that blocked in along with smart contracts didn't really work for the

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.950
upliftment and betterment off our farmers.
