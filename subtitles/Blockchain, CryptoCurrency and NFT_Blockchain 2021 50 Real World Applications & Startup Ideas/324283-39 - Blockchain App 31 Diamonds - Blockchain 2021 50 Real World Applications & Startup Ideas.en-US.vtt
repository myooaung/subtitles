00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
diamonds represent beauty,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.660
love and liberty.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.150
That diamond re gift it to your spouse on your university.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.250
Do you know about its authority?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.250
There are very high chances that you don't,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.910
but you should understand that it is very crucial to know the origin and history off the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.060
precious gemstones,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.780
such as time,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.150
because in the market many unethical companies might conflict or blood diamonds.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.950
Blood diamonds are the diamonds that are mined involves all and I used to finance toilets.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.650
Then there are counterfeit us too,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.250
who introduced fake diamonds into the system.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.000
Besides,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.450
there are mines where child labour prevails and abuse of human rights is so nice.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.850
Therefore,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.020
it becomes writing to ensure that the diamond you're buying is for authentic and conflict

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.350
free.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.910
In the current scenario,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.070
the jewelry industry relies on certificates to prove that the jam is not counterfeit or

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.850
sourced from conflict zones.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.450
But this process is cumbersome and paper records are not always attendee.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.830
Diamond industry is one of the first industries toe address block to technology to verify

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.650
the authenticity off the gemstones.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.090
A company ever legend has been tracking diamond since 2050 and has already tracked

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.250
prevalence of more than two million stools.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.550
No,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.600
let's understand,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.590
are blocked in can facilitate the making of the journey of a gemstone and establishing its

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.350
authenticity.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.490
All the stakeholders involved in the diamond industry and supply T we'll have to go to Okay

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.490
,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.480
I see verification and all that.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.070
11 documents will be stored on the bloody the stakeholders new to register the information

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.350
about diamond at each and every stage.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.340
The first step in the diamond industry is mining all the time in a blocked in system.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.210
The first step will be to register the mining location of the diamond on the block.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.130
Other political informations,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.940
like mining,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.250
was not done in conflict areas,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.350
there were no forced or child labours and there was no relation off human rights during my

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.350
will also register on the block to along with their respective proofs.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.530
After mining,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.550
the rough diamond is individually checked and evaluated on the basis over its size,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.450
color carry etcetera.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.380
In this step,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.830
the certificates will be added on the block to describing the attributes off the gym and a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.650
unique identification number will be given to the diamond.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.870
In the next step,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.950
the diamond is given a three dimensional view and polished,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.860
but this step as well that 11 information will be stored on the block later.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.240
But I'm really scared by listen.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.910
Every piece of diamond cut from the parent diamond will be given a sub unique

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.450
identification number and then punished.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.850
This information will also be stored on the block to network.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.570
Further,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.110
the diamond is given graves after taking its quality,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.600
using high magnification instruments in the Blockchain based system.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.850
All of the certificates will then we start on the block.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.450
That's each transfer and process.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.250
We be the district on the Blockchain until the diamond is sold to the consumer.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.770
Therefore,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.270
with blocks in technology,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.550
a permanent and immutable record off the dirty over diamond can be created.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.350
Finally,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.790
a customer can easily verified the provenance and authenticity of the diamond by simply

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.030
scanning the unique identification number present on the diamond like diamonds blocks and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.950
can also be used to track the authenticity of gold and other precious gems.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.650
This whole journey and providence off these matters can be no
