00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
today.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.660
Elektronik health records,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.780
often individual,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.040
are very in structured man and controlled by health care providers in their respective

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.350
central databases.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.750
These databases let interoperability security on Neverland ableto hacking.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.170
Although we have computers in nearly every medical facility on mobile phones in every

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.700
pocket,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.970
we're still face difficulty in collecting,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.550
exchanging and sharing over medical history with a new doctor sharing medical data between

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.170
various health care providers.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.350
While men tailing privacy and integrity of the patient's data is the biggest challenge that

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.050
healthcare systems face today.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.650
The health care system is no digitized everywhere in the world.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.260
Many health care providers still follow the traditional process and provide the

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.780
prescriptions on paper and graphs.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.860
In such a scenario,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.240
it becomes difficult for both patients and healthcare providers who refer to these

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.040
prescriptions whenever required In the future,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.650
the health care systems work in silos and lack interoperability.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.880
Even the healthcare systems off different department within the same hospital,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.150
unable to interact with each other.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.620
So you can very well imagine the level of difficulty when systems of different care

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.120
providers have to interact with each other in case of emergency conditions,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.450
or if a patient wants to change the health care provider.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.460
It becomes challenging for him to procure his clinical history and shared that with the new

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.340
service provider.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.670
All diagnostic tests have to perform again to know the exact problem,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.550
thus resulting in a delay treatment and further aggravation off the issue.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.580
When the doctor is treating a patient who needs emergency here,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.140
it becomes very difficult for him to know if the patient is allergic toe any specific

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.690
medicine.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.150
He has to be extra cautious and has to perform the drug allergy tests to validate this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.840
because the consequences can be quite dire.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.390
If the patient is administered any such medicine that he's allergic to,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.150
it is nearly impossible for hospital pharmacies to have a clear picture of the patient data

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.150
.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.050
This,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.780
in turn,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.860
becomes a challenge for them to predict inventively required to meet the needs of the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.580
hospitals,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.590
for example,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.360
in case of a sudden outbreak.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.520
Or do you do some seasonal diseases that pharmacists can go out of stock due to no

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.020
availability of this data further that direction?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.360
Or that this lead to delay treatment and force health care providers and patients to shift

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.820
toe alternate medicines,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.650
which in turn decreases the effectiveness of the treatment.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.190
Telemedicine can be used as effectively either.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.140
Every time a patient concerts online,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.810
he is required to fill all his student days.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.840
There's no effectively for patients to share their health data with the provider

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.150
effectively through very more technology,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.860
most of the health reports and consultations our own people,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.700
thus making it cumbersome to be shared online.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.170
Tow away these telemedicine services.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.270
No.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.570
Let's see how Blockchain can solve these issues.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.780
Every patient will have a unique identity over Blockchain network,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.530
and this clinical later generated at various status will be associated with this unique

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.300
identity.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.230
As a Elektronik health record,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.300
digital asset blocks in technology can provide a truly interoperable network.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.790
Whenever a patient will undergo any diagnostic test or consultation,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.480
this information will be incorporated into patients unique Elektronik Health T Even the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.850
health related data collected from smart devices can also basic early incorporated into it

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.850
.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.050
This data can then be easily exchanged among various health providers as and when needed.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.800
This would even reduce the cost of health care treatment by avoiding that redundant

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.270
diagnostic tests and,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.430
most importantly,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.250
the health care provider can provide better patient kill on the basis of this accurate data

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.250
.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.410
While blocks in technology will help individuals to maintain their electronic health

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.070
records,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.830
smart contracts will ensure that only authorized healthcare providers can access these

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.500
health records that individuals or patients will be the owners off this medical data.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.480
The hospitals or researches shoots will require encrypted keys to get access to the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.450
patient's data.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.310
The patient will have the provisions to select who can excesses,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.350
information and for but duration.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.950
Individuals can also pre authorize the health care providers to see their information

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.990
during any enforcing emergence.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.950
The technology also first flexibility toe individuals either to reveal their identity or

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.510
share their data anonymously or pseudo,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.350
and only mostly.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.550
They can even decide what part of the information should be shared with these gay providers

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.550
.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.720
Once implemented,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.520
the electronic health records on Blockchain will serve as a common an integrated bag,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.950
one for the health care industry.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.190
It will also reduce the overhead costs for hospitals and healthcare providers.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.440
This transparent system can help government to effectively identify the needed two reasons

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.670
for which the health schemes have been started.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.690
The hospitals can give the control and needed access toe their pharmacies to maintain the

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.380
required in mentally so as to prevent the shortage of medicines and dust.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.880
We went any delay of medical care for the patients during emergency cases.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.650
The doctor really has an access to the patients clinical history.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.260
He has to perform all the required test that results in a delay treatment through this

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.550
theater on Blokhin,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.230
the local can easily access the patient's clinical history,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.070
and thus the need of doing the dentists will be avoided.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.710
That can fasten the treatment and cut down the medical costs.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.650
At the same time,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.550
the health care providers and also we made cognizant off the allergies and breath

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.590
incompatibilities off the patient through the H and R Block tin.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.170
In the current scenario,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.690
a doctor is required to perform the direct allergy tests again as the allergic medicine can

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.750
further worsen the condition of a patient.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.610
Let's understand it to an example.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.680
Our patient is allergic to a specific girl,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.830
say pencil.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.450
He gets some bacterial infection and visits a doctor for his treatment.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.130
If the doctor has access to the patient's medical history,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.460
he will be aware of the fact that the patient has allergy to pensively and subsequently he

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.700
will prescribe him some other medication,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.050
avoiding penciling,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.710
thus taking care off any unwanted medical error and any further health complication that

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.850
distributed hyper letter technology.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:33.870
We also play a critical room in better adoption and working off telemedicine and remote

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.490
monitoring.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.810
In case the patient is unable to physically visit the health care provider,

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.240
he can easily share his peers health records remotely and get the medical advice while

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.250
sitting at his home.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:52.510
Telemedicine can reduce the clinic visits and can also save the communication time required

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.370
to hesitantly.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.420
I 02 devices,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.760
along with Blockchain,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.600
can provide real time data on vital patient measurements such as blood pressure,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.360
heartbeat,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.850
etcetera for better diagnosis.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.010
It will also assistant family for Lopes,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.850
with doctors,

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:14.750
thus making it easier to detect early signs off certain serious health conditions.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.660
Last but not the least.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:23.480
This technology would be a great help for the people who live in rural areas and don't have

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.470
access to good medical facilities.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.390
It can be a great opportunity for a better collaboration between the health care providers

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.830
as well.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.500
They can share the patient's information with each other to get an expert advice with do

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.550
consent of the patient on the Blockchain.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:46.320
That growing trend of consumer healthy rebels like Fitbits Health Pence,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.350
Apple Health Kids and Watches is ushering in a new era.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.350
Off consumer is ation off health care.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:59.530
These devices recorded daily data and activities of a consumer like Galaxies.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.700
Step counts miles,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.490
heart rate,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.250
etcetera.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.360
With Blockchain technology.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.230
All this daily data can be club with other medical healthcare data lately,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.120
like visits,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.300
demographics,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.230
allergies,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.920
lab tests and much more further,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.570
with the implementation of smart contracts,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.950
This data can be used to provide better medical care and monitoring by the doctors.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.700
Let us understand it through a practical work scenario,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.800
and he was diagnosed with fatty liver,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.570
and therefore Dr Steve designed a special exercise as human for him.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:42.510
A smart contract is said between them to check whether Andrew sticking to the regiment

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:48.760
prescribed by the doctor and whose variable smart gear looks in his daily movements,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.550
his exercise regimen and other essential date of ones.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.290
After every three days,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.380
the smart contract,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.550
very face in their terms of the contract are fulfilled,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.410
and Dr Steve gets notified.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:09.750
If Andrew fears to adhere to his exercise regimen continuously for two times thus,

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:15.390
you can t smart contracts when club with low tin can really be a game changer for the

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.390
health care industry,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:23.840
you will be sure to know that your Health Data Club with millions of other users is sold by

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.450
medical in for Matic companies toe farmer companies for billions of dollars.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:33.960
Farmer companies used this bundle later for research and marketing purposes.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.400
Off course,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.180
the name and other crucial are indifferent.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.630
Details are taken off before bundling and sharing the data of millions off uses.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:49.740
The biggest irony here is the fact that this data belongs to you and got recorded against a

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.470
payment and by you or your insurance company.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.750
But it gets sold without your prior knowledge and consent,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.540
but blocked in.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.350
This situation is bound to change where you control your own data.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.690
With this technology,

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.980
you can share your data and only mostly or with your actual identity.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.690
Once you give your approval on this,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.280
your consent will be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.560
The farmer companies can very for your consent by using lucky that connects the Blockchain

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.650
and can then use your data for the medical research and marketing purposes.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.860
Subsequently,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.470
you will also be given a pie off that revenue generated from this transaction.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.380
Additionally,

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.800
it is going to be a great helpful these farmer companies as well because having a direct

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.020
relation with the patient will help them in getting more valuable insights,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.270
which is not visible in the current board.
