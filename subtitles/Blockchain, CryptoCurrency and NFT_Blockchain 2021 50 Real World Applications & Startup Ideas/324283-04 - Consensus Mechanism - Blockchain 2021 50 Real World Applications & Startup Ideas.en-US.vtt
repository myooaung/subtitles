00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
blocks in technology has been the talk off the down due to its potential to disrupt

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.070
industries on a global level.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.360
But for the blocked in tow.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.480
Bring about this mass level deception.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.470
It needs to have a reliable,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.200
robust officiant and secure consensus mechanism.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.450
Consensus means dating an agreement about something within a group of people.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.320
Consensus protocols are one of the very crucial aspects off blocked in technology blocks in

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.650
consensus algorithms are Avi to create fairness and equality in the Blockchain network.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.450
The purpose of a consensus mechanism is to validate and verify that the later be appended

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.750
to the Blockchain is valley.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.140
There are various mechanisms for consensus that are used currently each off themselves,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.290
the same purpose off validating the data being added.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.110
The blocked in though each of them does it defend it and quite naturally,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.440
eat.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.950
One of them has its own pros and cons.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.820
The major difference between these mechanisms is in the way they revolt and delegate the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.880
vilification of conceptions that,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.400
to most no table consensus mechanisms,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.480
are a proof of work or POW and proof of stake or B U.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.030
S,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.320
which we re recovering in this lecture proof offer is one of the older consensus mechanisms

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.150
that came into existence in the 99 piece,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.200
Proof of work has been attested consensus mechanism and has been used by various crypto

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.650
projects like Bitcoin al Attiyah.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.610
Proof of Work uses the computational power off the computers on the network to solve

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.720
complex mathematical problems and create new it frequents as a minor.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.110
A user is required to solve complex mathematical problem to get revolted by new actual

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.650
queens,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.950
for example,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.950
because in the big connect book.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.550
So let's understand how proof of work and mining works in the context of Bitcoin

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.040
transactions in the Bitcoin blocked in our bundle in the memory pool no.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.850
One s ma'am poo each transaction in the man who needs to be very fight.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.520
This verification is done by the miners,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.330
and this process of very vacation of the transactions is known as mine for very fine

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.370
transactions.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.950
The miners required to solve complex mathematical person the prisons are is medical nature

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.950
.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.650
That is,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.910
it is difficult to solve the puzzle,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.900
but it is very easy to verify the correct solution.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.750
By the next book,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.250
the presence don't require any skill set off the user.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.150
The whole possess only requires brute force in this puzzle solely the also solving the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.450
puzzle can be improved by acquiring more competition power.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.140
That this to have computers with powerful processes every time for solving a puzzle is 10

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.750
minutes,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.230
and once a person gets sold,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.000
the blow gets added to the block over time minus start,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.090
finding it easier to sold opposite and therefore the bloke generation time.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.200
Also get seduced from the proposed 10 minutes has to increase the difficulty level of the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.930
puzzle,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.900
and to make it more complex,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.550
the puzzle is revised after every 14 days.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.510
The symptom means that more computational power is required to solve the puzzle hands for

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.150
the miner who souls apposite first,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.550
his devoted with newly minted Bitcoins and network transaction fees.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.880
The verified transactions former broke and this book is then apple it with existing broke

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.150
too.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.780
One of the biggest challenges with proof of our consensus mechanism is the vestige of both

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.850
computing power and electricity to solve the mathematical possess required to my name bro.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.550
No legs understand how proof of stake works and how it is different from proof of work.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.150
Proof of stake was introduced in the year 2011.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.750
In this consensus mechanism,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.850
a bloke is alittle abduction by a valid itto who is selected by the end of my system.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.560
The selection of the blow Creator is decided by how much of the Cryptocurrency I use that

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
is having with himself or in some cases,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.150
also by the time duration poverty has been holding that Cryptocurrency.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.950
Contrary to the proof of work where the blow creation depends on the computational power,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.340
the block creation in proof of stake,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.740
is directly proportionate.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.490
Could I use us for leaving the Cryptocurrency or the underlining token off the network in

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.090
proof of stake and Santa's mechanism blocks are not mind.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.990
Instead,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.140
they are forced or minted and uses.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.020
Who created these books are not owners minus Instead,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.650
they're known as forges for very find the transactions and forging the bloke for just need

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.180
to look up some of the points at stake in this situation.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.390
The coins are held in the S group in case the users are found to be involved in validating

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.550
a photo and transaction.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.800
This takes gets slashed and they also use their right to be chosen as a forger in the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.250
future.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.150
The basic assumption behind this mechanism is the fact that because they coincide steak,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.600
they will be highly motivated to validate the right transactions in proof of state

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.350
mechanism.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.850
Crypto currency units are created initially at the time off launch for the currency,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.190
and their numbers are also fixed because the energy consumption proof of stake is

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.950
negligible as compared to proof of work.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.650
The bloke creators are not rewarded with the network coins.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.980
Instead,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.950
they're rewarded with the transaction fees for creating new blocks.
