00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
and that's very important to me.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.730
Blocked is going to destruct.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.150
Is a human resource management employees being the crucial matters of technology,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.450
Knowledge and service represent a core component off any enterprise.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.180
Nothing can substitute the significance of human resources for the continuing development,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.030
often organization on.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.820
Therefore,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.700
it becomes very important for an organization to verify the authenticity of human resources

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.950
before hiring them.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.950
Will any individual applies for a new job?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.880
He needs to submit a CV describing his complete history,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.650
including personal details,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.060
education details,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.780
previous work experiences,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.550
etcetera,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.650
these details and then checked by the Inter officials off the organization.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.660
This is quite a lindy process,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.140
as the Attorney Office needs to verify the credentials.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.140
Often individual mentioned in his singing but then blocked in the complete history of the

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.150
applicant will be available on the shared ledger.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.180
This includes on does Not limited to his education certificates,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.350
Acquired skills workshop for conferences,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.780
attended contact information,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.810
his previous work experience,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.390
all his promotions,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.370
appraisals,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.150
appreciations and awards won in the previous organizations,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.550
and even the reason for leaving the previous organizations before intervene.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.320
Suitable candidates organizations can pull all their history from the Blockchain and that

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.250
will help them to take better decisions during the hiring process.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.450
The current procedure to own one new recruits.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.970
It's quite in London to just process when an individual is hired by an organization,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.860
there is a lot of paperwork that they need so complete.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.170
Like submitting his previous records,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.260
signing job offer experiments,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.350
signing non disclosure agreements,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.150
etcetera.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.390
The papers,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.180
looking multistate approvals continued toward his whole employment.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.950
Like second,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.220
for example,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.000
Venice Switches is Rule or his department all he gets promoted on when he quits the company

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.850
for a better career opportunity,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.710
he is required to go through multilevel approval process.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.970
Photo.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.340
Veni joins a new organization.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.250
He has to go to the entire process again.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.750
He has two against amid all his documents to his new employer.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.630
But with the implementation of blocked in complete information,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.530
often individual will be available to the potential employer,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.910
thus reducing the time and energy spent on the validation and verification often employ and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.670
therefore streamlining the whole let surpluses in the current scene.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.630
Are you estimating and calculating the animal?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.250
Texas is a pain for any employee,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.910
and it isn't even bigger headache for the contract focus due to a higher degree of the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.350
complications involved.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.510
Block Tin can make their life easier for everyone this month and read from Vocus of Fear

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.470
accounting systems that would calculate the Texas for individuals,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.400
which can be easily audited by everyone on the block to network like employ text department

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.160
etcetera imply sentry savings,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.070
donations,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.070
exemptions,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.920
investments and other sources of income can be recorded on the shared led to and based on

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.640
this available information,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.540
his take someone will be calculated on deducted at the pre defined time without the need of

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.050
any manual intervention.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.080
Even today,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.650
the majority of the organizations have all off the employer Germans on a piece of people,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.350
and the answer department is required to validate and maintain these agreements.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.080
But it's smart contracts.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.250
Everything can be made seamless.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.450
All the examine conditions can be pretty find in a smart contract,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.330
and when they decided conditions are fulfilled,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.130
smart contract gets executed automatically.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.990
For instance,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.800
if an employee promotion or bonus conditions are fulfilled,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.330
the smart contract will get executed and automating bonus amount or promotion orders will

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.050
be released to the respective employees.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.420
If an organization is required to hide a person on the contract bases,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.850
the vote conditions and payment.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.550
ALS can be pretty finding a smart contract.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.380
And when the pre defined conditions are met,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.580
smart contract will get executed and an automatic payment will be released to the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.850
contractual resource.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.630
Roatan technology can be used to start by mitigate off employees such as fingerprints.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.050
All ideas Can the attendance off employees can be stood and dragged on.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.350
The sheer ledger expenses done by employees for the official work can also very cauldron

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.480
the block to having a transparent and immutable record will make it much easier for the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.870
employees to get quick approvals and claim their expenses from the concern department today

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.870
.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.750
If an employee has to claim for the official expenses done by him,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.550
he has to go to a series of stakeholders for getting the required approvals.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.500
This,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.140
in turn,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.450
becomes a frustrating anti just us for an employer,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.450
and also effect is work efficiency.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.350
As a lot of time is vested in getting these approvals,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.860
claims can readily be settled as chances off fake limbs will be negligible goingto the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.050
transparent and immutable characteristic of the Blockchain.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.400
This would decrease the unnecessary,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.020
has foreign employ,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.850
and he can devote suspicious time in productive project work.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.830
An important major task of finance and human resource department is to release the salaries

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.450
off employees on time after very finger attendance and other books that there seems.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.370
If all conditions of the facial are defined in the smart contracts sell this will be

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.370
released to employees automatically on the end of the month or week.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.850
Ask predetermined the streamlining the complex management crosses.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.150
From a complex perspective,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.370
Block Tin can help organizations to know the providence of a particular item on to validate

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.550
its authenticity.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.050
Let's take an example of pharmaceutical company when the raw materials a try for them

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.430
infecting off drugs.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.060
The concern department of the company needs to verify the authenticity.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.530
Off the raw materials received so blocked in technology it will become easier for them to

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.220
validate if supplied has sent the authenticated raw materials after the drugs.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.140
Kidman pictured the need to arrange and keep track of the logistics product delivery

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.850
etcetera,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.260
which requires a lot of manual book phone calls,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.700
emails etcetera but locked in,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.080
they can keep a real time track off.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.670
The journey of the project does simply find their tusks every individual who applies for a

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.540
job in a new organization.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.930
We just don't know about the Vogue attics,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.250
culture on reputation off that organization.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.420
He also wants to know if there any challenges that he may face after joining the

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.350
organization.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.340
Getting the late salaries,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.870
work,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.750
life balance,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.110
working beacons,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.850
etcetera.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.030
In another scenario,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.430
if an employee is not satisfied with his organization and find some practices off his

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.050
organization unethical,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.700
he should have a plant from the richest company and raised this concern without revealing

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.650
his identity.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.850
But at the same time,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.550
anonymous treating doesn't give the required credibility to any rating or if you,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.350
as many a times these are also fake.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:07.610
Bloating offers a platform where an employee who has worked or is working can drink that

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.350
organization without revealing his identity.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.670
True,

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.460
blocked in.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.670
It can be verified that the review has vote,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.030
always working with the company but his identity.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.050
One Billy Field.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.750
With such a platform in place,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.690
it would be much easier for a potential applicant to know the true picture off the

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.730
organization,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.050
and they come better informed decision before joining an employer
