00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
does that food back at Labour Less organ E that you recently board really organic?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.510
What is it?

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.350
Just a marketing.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.750
Give me to charge you extra for the normal food with just a level change.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.370
Our force,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.070
a plating is under constantly from a generation that is affecting many lives,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.450
and there is no way to know the origin off the problem.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.120
According to W.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.590
To one out of every 10 person becomes still every year after consuming contaminated food,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.250
which ends up taking approximately 4 20,000 lives every year.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.540
Here in this class,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.620
we will study that challenges that are for industries facing today,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.740
Father.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.640
It will also see how blocked in is going to disrupt this industry and bring about the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.950
paradigm shift in how it works.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.950
Now let us look at the challenges that that food industry faces.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.490
The biggest challenge that this industry faces is the complexity off the global food supply

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.990
chain,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.450
and it is nearly impossible for Taylor's exact provenance of the product.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.850
Four contamination cases are realise despite strict quality checks and measures implemented

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.650
by dealers once the contaminated food item,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.770
it is the self off,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.590
a supermarket or a big retailer and it is consumed,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.750
the consequences can be quite dire.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.430
This endangers the health and lives of the customers and proved with big menace.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.650
For the read A company or the supermarket,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.090
Sir Teevens not only resulted big financial losses but also leads to an erosion of trust,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.850
loyally and reputation of the retailer's.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.320
Further,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.170
it is not easy to attract a particular food item,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950
and it's source to leave the evil in the bud.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.730
It takes a lot of paperwork and toiling to find the exact item and reach back to its

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.010
original source.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.390
Till then,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.870
everything is labeled less contaminated and customers mine.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.140
It may happen that the four producer sent a good quality full,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.800
but the tempering was done by some other player linked involved in the supply chain.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.770
In such cases,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.660
it becomes a daunting task to identify the north in the chain where this adulteration or

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.450
contamination was introduced.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.260
The loopholes in this complex food supply t are exploited by fraudsters as the purposely

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.250
adult rate tamper Miss Labor and substituted one product with another for the economic

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.980
profits.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.690
Few four products that highly placed because they livers indicated they're organic,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.070
but there is no way for a customer to validate if the perp is really organic,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.350
for which he's being Dexter apples.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.140
Fraud can occur in the raw materials or in a specific ingredient or in the Firebird.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.020
The ramifications of food fraud are many and can range from damage to the brand to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.910
financial losses to the retailers.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.560
And the first off them can even result in the poor health of the consumers certain perhaps

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.790
our famous or unknown when attached with a specific origin.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.560
For instance,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.950
the label French Wynonna Vine border indicates that the origin will be funds.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.860
But actually the origin off that vine is a different country,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.950
say Spain.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.480
And this is a real scenario which came to light recently.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.820
There,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.460
millions of Spanish time borders were being sold US French wine.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.130
This is not limited to just this one case.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.080
If we look around us,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.150
we will easily find many instances and anecdotes off food,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.770
throats some of the normal examples that we make you realize the gravity and seriousness

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.550
off this situation can be.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.310
In a 13 2004 3rd case in UK,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.750
horsemeat was mixed with beef and they were together label and so less beef in the market.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.430
In 2008 Chinese infant formulated food was contaminated with chemical plastic named Mela

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.880
mine,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.650
which hospitalized thousands off infants.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.650
It has been claimed that around 70% of Coppola coffee is no Jimmy Copal.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.090
What coffee is extremely expensive compared to a regular coffee and that very high risk of

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.350
fertile and adulteration.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.560
Honey is consistently in the top 10 4 forts as honey is one of the most expensive forms of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.180
sugar.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.880
It is commonly adulterated with other sugar sit ups like consider cane sugar at sector

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.190
doing,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.440
please.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.370
It's told you words in all the oil that weakens.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.150
You might be adulterated with some other less expensive oils,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.350
like sunflower oil or peanut way.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.510
And in case you decided related with peanut oil,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.070
it can cause serious health effects to people who have allergy to peanuts.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.390
These loopholes in the four industry can be sold by the Blockchain technology.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.770
This distributed ledger technology facilitates a shared digital view off the transaction

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.370
data toe All the permission members in the Food Supply Net book each transactional.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.950
The legend is immutable and is recorded only after the consensus among the members.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.170
The innate characteristic off mutability and transparency that this technology provides

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.650
help trust among the consumers.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.710
Now let us look how this technology actually works for a banker for safe people,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.750
the consumers.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.980
There are many stakeholders involved in the food supply team management,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.470
and each of them has to record a relevant information on their digital legend that is

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.040
immutable and can be seen by other permission members.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.520
Off the Net.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.450
The supply teen starts with the farmers who grew our food,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:09.460
the information they're required to store on the block Tim is location alti tude,

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.050
at which the plants are grown.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.990
Irrigation treatment growth condition off the plants like temperature,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.970
humidity,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:23.210
soil fertilizer is used other information like date of harvesting and dispatching to the

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.580
next link in the team.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.090
They also need to provide the certificates,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.920
if any,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.350
to prove that the food they have grown have specific characteristics.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.180
Leg being organic or cruelty free.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.350
Next comes four processes.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.200
It lasts from four products supplied by the four producers into the products that meet

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.690
consumers requirements.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.500
This process is also known as Ford Manufacturing.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:56.580
The food manufactured at this stage can either be in ready to its state for consumers or it

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.350
can further actors no materia to create other four products by different foot processes.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.470
The records that they are required to keep on digital editor art their location received it

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.270
of no materials sampling details.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.890
Analysts off the Ford received the processes and the materials used for manufacturing date

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.450
of manufacturing and shelf life of the food storage conditions of the processed food

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.450
packaging conditions off food dispatched day to the next link in the tail etcetera.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.830
Even the ideal temperature,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.600
reach and other conditions require need to be recorded on their digital letters.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:41.450
Distributor's act as a link between food processing companies and wholesalers or retailers

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.450
.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.290
They're distributed.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.430
Receives pallets and cartons off food from the processes.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.550
As the name suggests,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.150
you distribute the food received through various sandals through the end customers.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.180
These tennis can be wholesalers or retailers,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.150
who in turn provide these four products with a final consumers.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:08.190
The information required to be stored at this stage is receiving data food storage

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.050
conditions,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.600
invent really details and especially to the subsequent links in the team.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.350
The Taylors received these products from distributors and sell these to the end consumers

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.620
the retailer needs to record the received items in mentally tastes,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.300
stories,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.950
details and sales information on the ledger.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.410
The consumer is the final link in the food supply.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.390
T who consumes this food,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.980
therefore,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.350
should have full rights to know that detail information about the food.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.730
With the blocked in technology,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.140
he will be able to see all the information that President Corded on their digital ledger

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.370
floated journey.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.630
It is just a matter of a few seconds to praise the origin of the food.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:58.450
It's authenticity and the journey test take before entering his shopping cart.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.990
Every food product has been provided a unique identification number or Q accord.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:10.270
When this you are Courtis can't to a smartphone or the unique orders entered into the

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.500
company's website,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.910
Whole history of the food can be tracked right from its origin.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.460
Dell'Utri.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.850
It is the shells of the store,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.950
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.820
As to Mr each year,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.080
48 million Americans becomes sick because of consumption of contaminated food.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.720
Out of these,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.040
48,120,000 are hospitalized and 3000 used a life toe.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.950
This illness.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.150
When a foodborne disease outbreak occurs,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:47.190
it is very crucial that the source of contamination is identified at the earliest possible

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.190
.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.770
But with such a complex supply chain and fragmented data,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.730
that respect is quite slow,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.650
which leads to a loss off many precious lives.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.030
But with bloating,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.650
the providence of a product can be traced back within the course of a few seconds.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.980
The Republican easily take the serial number associate ID with the contaminated for

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.050
shipment back to the distributor and then puts or is no supplier.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.560
Subsequently,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.430
that's a plaid will immediately be flag on the Blockchain,

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.900
and everyone who has sourced that food item from that supplier would be made aware of the

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.760
danger are more appropriate.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.000
Example of this situation is the Roman like this incident that took place recently in 2018

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.780
where the lettuce contaminated with equally effective at least 200 people in 36 states off

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.130
us and even lead to death or five people contaminated canal water used for irrigation.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.060
Was the cause off like this getting infected with equal I Pathogen Street.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:55.350
It took them months and a great deal of effort to praise the origin point off the problem.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.790
If every information would have been on a digital letter.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.540
It would have been much easier to determine the origin off the problem from where the

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.950
contaminated batch off like this was sourced.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.310
And once the origin distract,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:14.370
it is much easier to elect everyone and take all the lettuce off the shelves.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:20.830
Source from that particular location supplier or from this will not only save the precious

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.440
lives,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.090
but will also save retailers from the financial losses which they have toe bill when they

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.070
take off all the food items off that category.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:35.910
Until the sources identified to give you a real left industry example off blocky,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.250
Let us take the case of Almonte.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.040
Recently,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.750
it conducted respect test on a back off mangoes in one of its stores.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.750
It took them more than six days to trace back the origin of these my ankles.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.140
And when the same test was conducted using Blockchain,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.250
it took them a mere 2.2 seconds to find the original form.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:03.070
So you can imagine how powerful and useful this technology is for the food industry.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.960
It will help in food recourse and there this is the time consumers Alatriste
