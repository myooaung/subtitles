1
00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:03,731
Let's talk about more than 30 crucial things

2
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:06,047
you might need to bring or pack

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,090
or do before your speech, okay?

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,633
And I've been working on this list over 20+ years

5
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,789
based on my failures, right?

6
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,400
And I want you to work smarter and not harder

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,020
and learn from my mistakes, okay?

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,018
And I want you to look over this list a couple of times

9
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,354
before your speech, okay?

10
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,882
And prepare these days or weeks in advance of your speech.

11
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:25,715
Okay.

12
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:29,809
Number one, okay, please pack or bring an extra shirt,

13
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,341
pants, jacket, et cetera.

14
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:34,773
And don't forget to get your clothes dry cleaned, you know,

15
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:37,191
a week or so before at least, okay?

16
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:40,331
And don't forget to wear clean shoes because that's what

17
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,583
people see when you're up on the stage, right?

18
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,261
And make sure that your shoes are soft bottomed, okay,

19
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,262
so you don't make noise when you're walking on the stage.

20
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:49,805
Otherwise, all people will focus on

21
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,787
is that distraction, okay?

22
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:52,951
Number two.

23
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,618
I want you to pack or bring a steamer, okay?

24
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:00,327
I like it better than an iron, right,

25
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,170
because it's just easier to use and it doesn't

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,075
hurt your clothes as much, right?

27
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:08,081
And so that's how I did this backdrop here and this shirt,

28
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:08,914
you steam it, right?

29
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:10,132
It's really easy to use.

30
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:12,621
You can get them for really cheap on Amazon.

31
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:16,413
And separately, let me know, answer this in the Comments

32
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:18,302
section if you know what movie this is from,

33
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,802
I recall Central Park in fall.

34
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,298
Alright, anyway.

35
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:24,899
I'm dating myself, okay?

36
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:26,492
Hint, it's from the '80s.

37
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:27,872
Okay, moving on.

38
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:32,413
Oh, and steam and iron your stuff the night before,

39
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:34,330
never the day of, okay?

40
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:39,626
Because what happens is if you put on a wrinkled shirt

41
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,224
it irons to your body, you sit down, it's looks really bad.

42
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,248
Anyway, just don't do it.

43
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:45,081
Okay.

44
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,108
Number three.

45
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:50,395
Pack or bring mints in case you speak with anyone

46
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,623
after the presentation, okay?

47
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,037
Number four.

48
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:57,504
Pack or bring a Nutra-Bar, right?

49
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,785
And put them in your jacket pocket, alright,

50
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,773
or laptop bag and eat an energy bar, these Nutra-Bars,

51
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,606
right before you go on.

52
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:05,653
I love these things called Quest bars, right,

53
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:07,463
because they have low carbs, whatever,

54
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,398
or net carbs, I should say.

55
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:13,543
Anyway, the best one is the Oreo cookie one.

56
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,731
Okay, number five.

57
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:20,463
Pack or bring a bottle of water as they sometimes forget

58
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:23,380
to give it to you when you present.

59
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,946
Okay.

60
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,856
Next up.

61
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,676
Pack or bring business cards and product details

62
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:32,433
and brochures, if applicable, okay, on your product.

63
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:36,366
Okay, I want you to also bring a few cheap USB drives,

64
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:39,169
right, that have details of your product.

65
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:42,999
And have them ready in your pocket and give them to massive

66
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:46,635
potential customers, right, or sales prospects, whatever.

67
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:48,169
Okay.

68
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,488
Number seven.

69
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,557
If your speech is early in the morning and you

70
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:54,989
usually get up later, or if you're in a different time zone,

71
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,607
I want you to get up earlier for at least a few days

72
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,928
before your speech.

73
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,783
And if your speech is later in the day,

74
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,181
if you have the luxury, I want you to get up later

75
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,833
in the day as well so you're more fresh, okay?

76
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,071
Number eight.

77
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:11,520
Pack or bring your identification, okay?

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,873
As you might need it to get into the building, right,

79
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:16,531
or the room, okay?

80
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:17,364
Number nine.

81
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:22,350
Pack or bring a USB drive back-up with your speech on it,

82
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,419
okay, just in case, just in case, okay?

83
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,252
You want to be ready.

84
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,398
Number 10.

85
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:32,002
Pack or bring your clicker and back-up batteries

86
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:32,961
for your clicker.

87
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,790
I actually have a back-up of this one even,

88
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,421
which saved my ass one time, okay?

89
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,748
Number 11.

90
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:43,143
Please pack and bring your laptop and make sure

91
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:46,243
your laptop is charged in case you cannot plug it in

92
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:47,933
on the stage, okay?

93
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,162
And the audio-visual person should help you with this,

94
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:55,559
right, but actually, this is kind of controversial.

95
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:59,314
If the audio-visual person tells you to use their laptop

96
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:03,361
I want you to be very stubborn and politely say no.

97
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:04,194
Okay?

98
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:07,115
Just trust me on this one, okay?

99
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,142
Number 12.

100
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:11,183
If you can, borrow or bring a back-up laptop

101
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,775
from a friend, right?

102
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,433
And always bring your laptop with you on a flight

103
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,143
and carry it with you and not in your checked luggage

104
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,721
in case it gets lost.

105
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,961
Twelve.

106
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,354
I want you to bring in all types of cables to attach

107
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:27,062
your laptop to a monitor, just in case they don't

108
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:29,369
have the right cables at the events, right?

109
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,795
They forget a lot, okay?

110
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,932
And please don't be cheap, right?

111
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:36,334
I want you to buy the best brand, if you can,

112
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,502
and test it out before, right?

113
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:41,982
And if you can, buy the brand made by the company

114
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,599
that made your laptop.

115
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:48,060
And I think we all know that buying cheaper iPhone

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,272
or Android chargers doesn't work because they stop

117
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,012
working after a while because, you know,

118
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:55,747
you always get what you pay for, right?

119
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,015
Alright, number 14.

120
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,850
If there is sound in your presentation,

121
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,129
I want you to bring or borrow or buy small,

122
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:07,797
powerful speakers, right, as a back-up if you want.

123
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:09,979
You can keep the receipt, too.

124
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,843
(throat clearing)

125
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:12,676
Number 15.

126
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,126
Pack or bring a charged iPhone, Android, or tablet

127
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,709
for a timer, right?

128
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,857
Timers ships with these things, too, right?

129
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:25,287
It's part of the operating system now.

130
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,759
And what I do is I put the timer right beside

131
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,288
my laptop screen if there is a podium

132
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,736
and I have the timer there so I can keep track.

133
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,057
So I don't have to pay attention to somebody

134
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,156
in the back of the room holding up a sign that says

135
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:39,518
five minutes left, right, that sort of thing, okay?

136
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:40,548
Sixteen.

137
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,804
Bring the phone number, obviously, of your contact

138
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:46,297
for the event and keep your phone on only before the speech

139
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:49,269
and then please turn it off before you go live, okay?

140
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,581
Seventeen.

141
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:54,127
Wear or bring layers of clothes in case the temperature's

142
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,529
too hot or too cold,

143
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,881
kind of like when you used to write exams, okay?

144
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,078
Number 18.

145
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,516
I want you to buy earplugs, if you want to,

146
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:05,683
so you can sleep well the night before, if applicable.

147
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:10,471
And consider even renting a hotel room, if you can,

148
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,430
closer to the event if travel is gonna be a nightmare, okay?

149
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,843
Number 19.

150
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:19,101
Email your contact for the speech the day before to confirm.

151
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,304
Number 20.

152
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:21,794
If you're speaking out of country,

153
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:23,529
make sure you bring the appropriate

154
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,784
electrical plug adapters.

155
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,414
Twenty-one.

156
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:30,189
Bring markers for a white board or bring a portable

157
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,771
white board, et cetera, if you need to,

158
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:36,919
in case you need to use it in the Q & A session, okay?

159
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,532
Twenty-two.

160
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,600
Travel to the event the day before

161
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,322
so you're familiar with the setting, if applicable, right?

162
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:44,851
Do you know where to park, right?

163
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:47,943
And bring cash as well because some places where you park

164
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:50,334
don't accept credit cards, okay?

165
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,334
Twenty-three.

166
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:54,644
Turn off all those annoying warnings on your laptop

167
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:58,205
like security notifications from Symantec or McAfee

168
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:01,674
or Windows update or Apple update notifications

169
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,864
and all that other nonsense.

170
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:05,088
You know what, just turn off Wi-Fi, right,

171
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,042
if you can, right?

172
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:09,571
And that might stop stupid notifications, right?

173
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:10,686
Number 24.

174
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:13,615
Please restart your laptop that morning

175
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,381
and make sure you have plenty of space on your laptop

176
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,541
so it can run a lot faster, right?

177
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,775
And only have your presentation software program open

178
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,798
after restarting, okay?

179
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,071
Twenty-five.

180
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,124
If you use a browser during the Q & A session,

181
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:30,477
make sure you have Wi-Fi access, of course,

182
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:34,264
and open your browser in private mode if you want to, right?

183
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:38,268
And the Wi-Fi code is quite often written at conferences

184
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:41,861
on the back of your name tag, if applicable, of course.

185
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,131
Twenty-six.

186
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:48,067
Run a security software scan on your laptop the day before.

187
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,643
It'll get rid of pop-ups and all that crap.

188
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:51,753
Twenty-seven.

189
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:55,191
Bring earphones and listen to whatever music gets you

190
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,108
in a relaxed and peak state before you present.

191
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,735
And, by the way, the second lecture of Act Nine

192
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:08,485
explains how to get into a peak relaxed and confident

193
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,582
state of mind, okay?

194
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:12,281
Twenty-eight.

195
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,271
If you're flying to present, obviously,

196
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:18,271
arrive way before, like the day before at least.

197
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:21,407
Okay, at least.

198
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:22,240
Twenty-nine.

199
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,394
Bring a notebook and a nice pen as well as you might need

200
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:28,712
to write down a question that you just can't answer.

201
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,788
So you could research the answer later that day

202
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:34,177
and email people directly the answers or say you will

203
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,611
put the answers that evening on your website

204
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,008
to the audience, okay?

205
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:42,226
And, of course, provide your web address as well, okay?

206
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:43,880
Okay, 30.

207
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,277
Bring a classy and a conservative bag to carry

208
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,892
your presentation items in.

209
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:52,049
And the same thing with your suitcase, right, if possible,

210
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:55,449
whatever, you know, if you're gonna bring it to the events.

211
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:57,500
I bought this really nice murse recently,

212
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,404
it's a purse for men, anyway, it's a bag for my laptop,

213
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:01,352
whatever, sorry.

214
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:02,185
Okay.

215
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:06,721
Oh, bring, Number 31, pack aspirin or throat lozenges

216
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,285
as well, if needed, okay?

217
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,768
And one thing I want to stress is that perception

218
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:13,410
really becomes reality in the mind of the audience

219
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,762
when it comes to every single thing about your appearance.

220
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:21,428
Bottom line, why are we bothering to pack

221
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,464
or bring all this stuff?

222
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:25,460
Because your competition won't

223
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,203
and one speech can change your life.

224
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:28,036
Thanks.
