1
00:00:01,077 --> 00:00:04,456
"The two most important days in a person's life

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:05,831
are the day you're born

3
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:07,519
and the day you find out why."

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,518
Mark Twain.

5
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:13,573
Please find attached to this lecture a 20 page document

6
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:16,323
of many of my favorite quotes.

7
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:20,456
Now you can pick one or more quotes

8
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:23,186
from the attached document and include them

9
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:24,929
in your presentation.

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,350
Now I did this because I want to help ya work smarter

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,059
and not harder when you're creating your speeches.

12
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,470
Okay, and so in this 20 page document

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,717
you'll notice that I created

14
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:39,406
26 different categories of speeches.

15
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,101
Everything from quotes about goals

16
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:43,630
or quotes about worrying,

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,034
or quotes about love or confidence or dreams,

18
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,861
distractions, gratitude.

19
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,128
Avoiding conflict.

20
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,373
Relaxation.

21
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,290
Energy.

22
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,199
Quotes about teaching, mentoring.

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,620
The power of why.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,407
Believing in yourself,

25
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:01,651
vision,

26
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:04,442
and seeing the good in everything, et cetera.

27
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:05,301
For example,

28
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,162
if you're presenting to a sales team,

29
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:10,524
you can consider starting your speech

30
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:12,897
with one of these quotes.

31
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:14,874
"Nothing is impossible.

32
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,420
The word itself says I'm possible."

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,373
Clever.

34
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,145
That was from Audrey Hepburn.

35
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,602
Or here's another one:

36
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:26,145
"The successful warrior is the average person

37
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:28,885
with laser-like focus."

38
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,161
Bruce Lee said that.

39
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,310
Okay, and actually, I think it was Bill Gates

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,658
and Warren Buffet said that

41
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,575
the most successful people have one major thing in common,

42
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,268
which is the ability to focus, okay?

43
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:40,478
Here's another one:

44
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,348
"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

45
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:46,023
Okay, that's Wayne Gretsky, fellow Canadian.

46
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,913
Represent.

47
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:50,018
Okay, other quotes you can start your speech with

48
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:52,409
include the following:

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,527
"I've had a lot of worries in my life,

50
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,298
most of which never happened."

51
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,206
Mark Twain.

52
00:01:57,206 --> 00:01:58,039
Okay.

53
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,622
Or "change before you have to."

54
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,681
Jack Welch.

55
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:04,819
Okay, another one is this:

56
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,760
"A goal is a dream with a deadline."

57
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,481
Napoleon Hill.

58
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,314
Or "If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship,

59
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:18,790
don't ask what seat. Just get on."

60
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,973
Sheryl Sandberg.

61
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,067
Okay, she's great.

62
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,196
Another one here is,

63
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:26,990
"you just can't beat the person who never gives up."

64
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,823
Babe Ruth.

65
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,407
"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."

66
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:36,585
Right?

67
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:37,429
That's Eleanor Roosevelt.

68
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,296
I love that.

69
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:40,163
And I love the notion of

70
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:40,996
unjustified criticism is

71
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:44,767
nothing more than a disguised compliment.

72
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,576
So bring it on, doubters.

73
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:48,056
Okay, here's another one:

74
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:51,268
"What we dwell on, we become."

75
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:52,413
Oprah Winfrey.

76
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,246
Okay?

77
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:55,621
So you can even start wedding speeches

78
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,559
or personal speeches

79
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,131
or toasts if you're asked to make one

80
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,779
on the spot without any preparation

81
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:03,870
with some of these

82
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,903
and the 150 quotes included in the attachments.

83
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,261
"Whatever our souls are made of,

84
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,790
hers and mine are the same."

85
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,373
Emily Bronte, okay?

86
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:18,152
"There is only one happiness in life:

87
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,924
to love and be loved."

88
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,658
George Sand.

89
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:22,829
Or another one's this:

90
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,805
"When love reigns,

91
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,381
the impossible may be attained."

92
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:28,631
Indian proverb.

93
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:32,356
"Love is a moment that lasts forever."

94
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:33,369
Anonymous.

95
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:37,183
Okay, and I used a quote to start and end my TEDx talk.

96
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,100
I also used many quotes in between.

97
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,308
And you can check out my TEDx talk

98
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,991
later on during the course.

99
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,365
We're gonna critique it, okay?

100
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:50,103
And let's talk about some other quotes.

101
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,531
I've actually opened a couple of my speeches

102
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,467
by quoting the Dali Lama by saying this:

103
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,908
"What surprises me most about Western society is

104
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:01,478
people sacrifice their health,

105
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:04,542
their entire lives, in order to make money.

106
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,283
And at the end of their careers,

107
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:09,122
they sacrifice all their money in order to

108
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,671
maintain their health.

109
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,611
And then they look back upon their life

110
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,823
and they realized they never really lived to begin with.

111
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,515
Okay, now notice how I didn't quote that perfectly.

112
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:19,796
It was a little bit off.

113
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:22,804
But as long as people get the gist of the idea,

114
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,869
that's good enough, okay?

115
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,069
Now if you're giving a business speech,

116
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:30,404
you can't go wrong by quoting someone like Warren Buffett

117
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,420
who once said that the New York Stock Exchange

118
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,168
is the only store in the world

119
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:37,248
where consumers sell stuff when it goes on sale.

120
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,230
I already said that before,

121
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,968
but it's important to reinforce, okay?

122
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,111
I think you get the idea.

123
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:44,116
Again, check out the 150 or so quotes

124
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,211
in the attached quote resource.

125
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,044
Thanks.
