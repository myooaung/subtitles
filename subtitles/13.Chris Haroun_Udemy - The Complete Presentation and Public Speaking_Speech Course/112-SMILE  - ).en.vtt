00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.264
Smiling

2
00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:19.063
puts you in a better mood to present.

3
00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:21.732
You don't want to appear stressed at all.

4
00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:25.022
I remember when my kids were younger,

5
00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:26.730
and I took them actually,

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.112
I remember in the double stroller,

7
00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.179
Andrew and Matthew, my two older boys,

8
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.604
I remember taking them for long walks.

9
00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:35.837
And I remember being kinda stressed out at times

10
00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:37.765
'cause having kids was all new.

11
00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:39.275
Of course, I loved it and all that stuff,

12
00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:40.730
but I was very busy.

13
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.188
And I remember being stressed out,

14
00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:44.394
and I'd walk by strangers

15
00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:46.286
that were strolling by me when I had my kids

16
00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:47.632
right in the stroller.

17
00:00:47.632 --> 00:00:51.963
And these strangers would always smile at me

18
00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:54.198
even though I wasn't smiling.

19
00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:58.176
And again, maybe I was stressed a little bit at the moment,

20
00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:01.169
but if you're older like me now,

21
00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:03.261
when you walk past a young parent

22
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:05.594
taking their kid for a walk,

23
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.969
they have the same stressed out look on their faces

24
00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.370
and I smile at them.

25
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.569
(speaks in foreign language)

26
00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.253
The more things change, the more they stay the same.

27
00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:17.936
And I want you to be the person smiling at them

28
00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:20.090
and not the other way around.

29
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.527
And that smile that you give to a parent walking their child

30
00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:29.250
is usually, it's usually a peaceful admiration one,

31
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
as peace always begins with a smile.

32
00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.771
And you can eliminate the stressful feeling of presenting

33
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:38.330
when you smile.

34
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.104
Just try it.

35
00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:44.059
Change your state and change your mood.

36
00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:46.735
And you feel peace in your heart when you smile

37
00:01:46.735 --> 00:01:48.883
as well when you present.

38
00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:53.414
And that's the type of relaxed, peaceful smile

39
00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:56.497
I want you to have while you present.

40
00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:01.786
And it slows down your delivery as well if needed,

41
00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:04.198
and I certainly need it at times.

42
00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:05.924
And again, one of my biggest critiques is

43
00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:08.666
I'm too fast at times when I speak.

44
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:12.395
But when I smile, I actually slow it down a bit as well.

45
00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:16.024
And separately, this is off script, but I don't care.

46
00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:19.691
For you young parents out there, smile back.

47
00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.676
I know that they never usually do,

48
00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.386
but I want you to smile back and live in that moment

49
00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:30.886
because you'll never get that moment back.

50
00:02:31.887 --> 00:02:34.150
And similarly, when we present,

51
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.317
I want you to smile and enjoy and just live in that moment

52
00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:43.012
because you'll never get that precious moment back.

53
00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:46.369
And then, separately, getting into the ideal,

54
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.448
perfect state when presenting

55
00:02:48.448 --> 00:02:52.704
is really based on you thinking of a moment

56
00:02:52.704 --> 00:02:56.350
you laughed and were incredibly happy in your life.

57
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.378
And it's interesting because when I was kid,

58
00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:02.263
I remember laughing so hard until it hurt.

59
00:03:02.263 --> 00:03:03.868
And then, you start working in a big company

60
00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:06.344
and you stop laughing like that.

61
00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:07.386
That's worth repeating.

62
00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.812
I know I mentioned it earlier.

63
00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:12.526
But where did all the laughter go as I aged?

64
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.693
I finally got it back now.

65
00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:18.496
But when you work at a big company,

66
00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:20.664
you don't laugh as much because you,

67
00:03:20.664 --> 00:03:22.872
you kinda transform yourself into

68
00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:25.537
a person that watches everything that they say

69
00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:27.590
and there's politics.

70
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.664
What a horrible fake existence,

71
00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:32.139
and I lived it for years as well.

72
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.415
Anyway, it is what it is.

73
00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.131
I want you to step out of the corporate matrix

74
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:38.548
when you present.

75
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.607
I want you to smile and be yourself.

76
00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:44.135
And damn it, enjoy the moment too,

77
00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.088
as the only judge out there of your performance

78
00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:49.933
that matters in that room is you.

79
00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:52.850
Have fun in that moment presenting,

80
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.340
and be happy.

81
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.394
Be you when you present,

82
00:03:56.394 --> 00:04:00.061
and show that million dollar smile of yours.
