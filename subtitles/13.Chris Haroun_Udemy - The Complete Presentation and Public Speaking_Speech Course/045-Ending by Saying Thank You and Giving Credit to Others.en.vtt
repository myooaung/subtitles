00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:03.367
I like to end my speeches,

2
00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:05.067
and start my speeches with thank you.

3
00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.471
Right, a lot of them at least, right.

4
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:10.970
And again, I like to end with thank you for your time.

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.661
Right, it's very important to also not forget who to thank.

6
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:17.181
A lot of times, people forget who to thank, right.

7
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.379
And a lot of Oscar winners will start by first, you know,

8
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.247
thanking God, or thanking their spouses, right.

9
00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:25.968
And many of them end with,

10
00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:29.101
lastly, I wanna thank my spouse, or God,

11
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:30.642
for making this possible, right.

12
00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:34.071
And in between, they thank the academy, right?

13
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:36.311
The producer, the director, actors.

14
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.810
Whatever, all that stuff, right?

15
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.962
And so sometimes, you start with the most

16
00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:42.162
important person to thank,

17
00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.311
or you end with the most important person to thank, right.

18
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.802
And if it's a wedding speech, you know,

19
00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.111
start or end with the most important person,

20
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:50.991
right, like I just mentioned.

21
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:52.978
And we're gonna go through plenty of examples

22
00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:55.201
of real wedding thank you's and speeches,

23
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.610
et cetera, in act 11, okay.

24
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.471
And my wife Christine, God bless her,

25
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:03.330
she's the best, I love her so much, right.

26
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.101
And she's so natural,

27
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:07.261
as she doesn't prepare for speeches.

28
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.939
She just kinda wings them, unlike me, right.

29
00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.606
And actually, during my wedding,

30
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:18.162
she spoke before I did, right.

31
00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:21.121
And she literally, literally said

32
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:24.430
almost everything that I was about to say.

33
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.471
Right, I remember, there was one line

34
00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:28.191
I was gonna use which was,

35
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:30.649
I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Right?

36
00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.562
And she used that, and everyone said, aww.

37
00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:34.911
I was like, damn it, that was mine.

38
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:35.744
That was mine.

39
00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:37.482
This marriage is not starting off on the right foot.

40
00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:38.670
Right, I'm just kidding, right.

41
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.701
We'll cover all this later.

42
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.729
It was a lot of fun, it was a lot of fun.

43
00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.442
Okay, alright.

44
00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:45.711
Let's pivot now, and talk about

45
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:49.162
thank you's in speeches for business speeches.

46
00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:53.618
Okay, although it's important to thank your boss,

47
00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:54.781
I think it's just as important

48
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.642
to thank everyone else that

49
00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:59.111
helped you make the presentation.

50
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.701
Especially your employees and your colleagues.

51
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:03.930
You know, always give credit to others if credit is due.

52
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.831
Right, and even then, yeah.

53
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:08.331
So, you might say, in closing,

54
00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.079
I wanna thank you all for your time,

55
00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.031
and I also wanna thank my team

56
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:17.042
for helping put together this presentation.

57
00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.922
Especially Samantha and George, et cetera.

58
00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.290
You get the idea, okay.

59
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.431
Giving credit to others is classy.

60
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.031
And just the right thing to do.

61
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:27.301
And again, we're gonna go through

62
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:30.221
many examples in act number 11.

63
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:32.442
I just wanted to kinda put this on your radar screen

64
00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:35.442
and introduce you to the concept earlier on in the course.

65
00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:36.275
Thank you.
