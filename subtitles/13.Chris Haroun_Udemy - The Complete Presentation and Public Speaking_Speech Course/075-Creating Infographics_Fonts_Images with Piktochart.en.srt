1
00:00:01,249 --> 00:00:02,845
Let's talk about Piktochart,

2
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:05,445
which is amazing for putting in infographics

3
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,321
and other images.

4
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,923
Okay, and what I'll do is I'll create

5
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,813
an infographic from scratch,

6
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,140
and I'll explain what that means,

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,233
and I'll show you some other really, really cool features.

8
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,471
Okay.

9
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:21,054
So let's create an infographic first, okay.

10
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,301
And infographics are great, to not only show

11
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:27,464
in a presentation, but also to email

12
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:30,826
to your customers, your associates, etc.

13
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:32,199
Okay, so let's do this one here.

14
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,291
Let's use this template,

15
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,319
and we always work smarter not harder.

16
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,353
We use what they have there, 'kay.

17
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:40,228
So let's just call this one, I don't know,

18
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:41,061
You 2.0.

19
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:43,404
Okay?

20
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:44,316
Alright.

21
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:45,326
Get rid of that.

22
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,902
Let's say we want to change the background image there.

23
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,130
We can go here to photos.

24
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,166
They've got like a million photos you can use for free.

25
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,440
It's pretty incredible, pretty incredible.

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,849
Right, so we drag that over there.

27
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,224
Okay, and actually let me try something cool here.

28
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:02,010
I'm going to throw in,

29
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,994
you can throw in icons of anything you want.

30
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:05,827
Throw that there.

31
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,501
I'm doing this very fast, on the fly.

32
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,999
You can throw in tons of different types of fonts,

33
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:12,249
or text styles.

34
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,208
It's pretty cool, pretty cool.

35
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,838
So I'm going to do a search one.

36
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,952
Here we go, it's what I was looking for.

37
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:19,785
Okay.

38
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:23,242
So we're going to search, I don't know,

39
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:24,492
search for you.

40
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:30,532
And I'm creating this on the fly, very quickly.

41
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:32,464
So there's tons of different types of graphics

42
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:35,920
you can insert, and photos, and photo frames

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
to go around stuff.

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,609
It's really, really intuitive,

45
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,445
and a lot of fun to use as well.

46
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:43,816
You can really get lost in this, right?

47
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:46,252
And so, let's put in a chart, okay.

48
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:49,547
You can really customize any type of chart you want

49
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:50,380
right here.

50
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,427
It's like you got your mini little Excel embedded here.

51
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,260
Right?

52
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,093
And it's free to use this,

53
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,174
but again they try to upsell you a lot of stuff,

54
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,874
which is always to be expected.

55
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:00,091
Okay.

56
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,838
So, say we threw in that one.

57
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,464
You can import your own data.

58
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,537
You insert it here.

59
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:07,026
Obviously I'd clean it up a little bit more

60
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,583
on a new slide.

61
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,117
Let me delete that.

62
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:11,207
This is neat here too.

63
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,603
You can go to maps.

64
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:15,121
Say we wanted to put in a map of Albania,

65
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:18,148
and just a certain area, right?

66
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:21,153
You can actually to this portion of Albania for example.

67
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:23,131
And you can add data visualization as well.

68
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,889
It's really, really cool.

69
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:26,282
It's amazing, it's amazing, right?

70
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:28,857
So when you mouse-over it can change colors as well,

71
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,030
if you wanted to, right?

72
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,448
And what you could do is you could even take

73
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,743
a screen print of this,

74
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:37,354
again on a Mac that's Command + Shift + 4,

75
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:40,521
or on a Windows desktop that would be,

76
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:45,243
you would just use the Snip Tool or Print Screen.

77
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:47,091
Take a picture and you can just put it

78
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:49,104
directly in your Powerpoint presentation,

79
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:51,173
or Keynote, or Google Slides

80
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,299
or whatever it is you use.

81
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,020
You can even do a video capture of this,

82
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,045
if you wanted to show a video of this in your slides.

83
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,735
And to do that, you would go here to QuickTime.

84
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:04,200
And QuickTime is available on Windows as well as Mac.

85
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,682
And you do a new screen recording.

86
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:06,515
It's not going to work because

87
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,045
I'm recording the screen right now.

88
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:12,116
And then you just crop and save whatever it is you record,

89
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,949
and put it into your presentation.

90
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,707
Okay, let's go back here.

91
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:19,207
What else can I show you here?

92
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,836
You can put in YouTube videos here

93
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,919
if you wanted to as well.

94
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,102
And that is an infographic.

95
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:31,269
Let me go back now and let's create something different.

96
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,146
Let's create a presentation, okay.

97
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,940
And you can use many different types of templates.

98
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,354
If you sign up for it and you pay for it,

99
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,149
they let you upload more stuff,

100
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:45,330
and get access to more presentation templates.

101
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,738
Right and you can use a lot of these things

102
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,255
and customize it yourself to throw into

103
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,136
any type of presentation you have,

104
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:55,411
or just browse through this to get ideas.

105
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,622
And then what you can do is if you pay for it,

106
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,620
which I don't, but if you do.

107
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,731
If you level up, it's kind of a cool upsell,

108
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,845
concept level up.

109
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,950
You pay 15 bucks a month or whatever it is,

110
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,705
and then go back and what you can do is

111
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:12,520
you can actually download those slides

112
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,694
in PDF format or whatever it is, right.

113
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,234
They try to get rid of the watermark

114
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:21,363
kind of like PowerTunes does as well if you pay for it.

115
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:22,458
Right.

116
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,580
So that's Piktochart.

117
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,051
Very, very quick overview.

118
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,404
Try it out, it's pretty cool.

119
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:30,113
And even if you don't use it,

120
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:31,178
just kind of browse through it

121
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,548
to come up with ideas for your presentation.

122
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:34,381
Thanks.
