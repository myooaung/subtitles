1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,689
Alright, now it's time to structure

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:04,949
your brilliant contents.

3
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,997
We are done discussing the silver cap bucket,

4
00:00:07,997 --> 00:00:11,522
it's now time to fill up the gold structure buckets

5
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:12,581
with our outline, okay?

6
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,043
And I'll explain how to do this soon, okay?

7
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:15,649
Just stay with me, please.

8
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,136
But in this lecture

9
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:20,589
I wanna talk about a more generic structured process

10
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,811
for your speech plus an exercise

11
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,425
to really help you structure

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,890
and order your contents, okay?

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,460
Now, you already have a decent idea

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,272
how to start your speech

15
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:39,489
as we covered this in your journal exercise number four,

16
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,948
Starting Your Presentation.

17
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:44,769
And in the next scene called Act Three, Scene Three,

18
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,612
we're gonna cover how to end your speech,

19
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,876
including thinking about how to reinforce

20
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:53,200
the bottom line message, and thanking people,

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,597
and the next steps if there is a call to action

22
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,274
from your audience, okay?

23
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:01,617
Okay, let's just talk about the middle stuff in your speech,

24
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:04,358
meaning not the start and not the end, okay?

25
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:08,063
When you write an essay

26
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:10,262
you have an introduction paragraph,

27
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:12,348
and a concluding paragraph, okay?

28
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:14,844
Everything in the middle, right, in-between

29
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:18,495
is used to discuss the supporting arguments or ideas

30
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,823
or stories or general descriptions, okay?

31
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:26,481
So, here's a very basic essay outline

32
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:30,050
that is also applicable to speeches, okay?

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,656
And you can even consider

34
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,981
visualizing the outline of your speech

35
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,785
using a similar bucket-based process,

36
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:40,768
and showing them to your audience

37
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,906
when you start your speech

38
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:45,462
if the speech is really long,

39
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:49,547
and if your audience is expecting an outline, okay,

40
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:52,018
meaning if you work at a company that appreciates

41
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,321
outline and structure all in itself.

42
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,125
Your call, your call, okay?

43
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,258
My job is to give you a menu of items,

44
00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:01,654
and then you select what option is best for you, okay?

45
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,596
So, each topic

46
00:02:04,596 --> 00:02:06,991
can be a business idea,

47
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,684
a recap of our progress,

48
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:11,775
an option to consider implementing.

49
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:12,608
I don't know.

50
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,930
A story about the groom about to be married,

51
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,564
a story about a family member,

52
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:21,739
a small part of a short toast.

53
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,678
We can then add another layer of structure

54
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:27,481
to our speech as follows, okay?

55
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,002
For each topic

56
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:31,386
we can discuss W5, right.

57
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:34,989
W5 means what, why, where,

58
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,017
when, who, right?

59
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:40,251
And then the next bucket is called how, right?

60
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,263
And then just to be objective,

61
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,847
you know, we can think about discussing

62
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:47,789
the risks with our presentation topic

63
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,735
because during the Q and A session

64
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:52,046
somebody might ask you about risks, right,

65
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,050
or holes in your logic, right,

66
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,148
and you can reiterate what you think

67
00:02:57,148 --> 00:03:01,224
the biggest risk is to topic number one etc.

68
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,403
Okay.

69
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:05,957
Again, you don't have to use everything I'm showing you

70
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:08,551
but I need to introduce this concept

71
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:11,260
as it will make our next exercise

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,421
of structuring the content easier for you, okay?

73
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,009
Don't worry though

74
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,358
because we can add more structure

75
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,389
or more sections later on.

76
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,711
You know, I just want to help you

77
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:25,843
organize your contents, okay?

78
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,982
Now, please watch the next lecture

79
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:30,237
called Journal Exercise Number Seven,

80
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,640
Structuring and Ordering the Content,

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,882
and I will show you an example of structuring,

82
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,141
and then sorting the content.

83
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,141
Thank you.
