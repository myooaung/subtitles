00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.371
After you create your unstructured content,

2
00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:08.269
I want you to think like a record or music producers,

3
00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.739
how they put the songs in order with an amazing

4
00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:14.109
song at the beginning that will be played

5
00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.107
on the radio a lot, or on the internet,

6
00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:18.635
I used to listen the radio, I'm old.

7
00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.088
And then at the end they usually put a very

8
00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.588
inspiring or great song, okay.

9
00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:31.459
And a great album, right, record, or piece of music,

10
00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:35.589
has incredible themes without too much complexity

11
00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.736
in the song arrangement.

12
00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.888
We're going to talk about this one in a second.

13
00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:41.949
You can always cut extra material

14
00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.437
that isn't relevant to your speech.

15
00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:46.949
Which is what we did in the previous exercise

16
00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.449
when we crossed out content or line items.

17
00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.556
Now, always, always, always remember the so what test.

18
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.938
Is everything we are showing or discussing

19
00:01:00.938 --> 00:01:03.997
relevant to our topic or not?

20
00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:08.568
And as a side note, this is cool and relevant to

21
00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.939
this album which, of course, is Abbey Road.

22
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.006
Which was a content and delivery

23
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:18.109
masterpiece of a presentation.

24
00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.528
Right, it's pretty cool.

25
00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:21.768
Actually I want to talk about this for a second

26
00:01:21.768 --> 00:01:24.909
because they, this was just an incredible album

27
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.189
and it's relevant, too.

28
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.907
Before we get there I want to show you something.

29
00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:32.149
What is that image in the middle of the record, there?

30
00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.349
Right, that's, of course, an apple, right.

31
00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:38.795
And Steve Jobs named his company, some people believe,

32
00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:40.237
because of this.

33
00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:43.686
Right, he was so inspired by the brilliance of

34
00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.557
The Beatles, right, because of their focus

35
00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:51.579
on creating artistic masterpieces like this.

36
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.949
This is not just music, right, this is a work of art.

37
00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:57.368
And there's actually a rumor when this album came

38
00:01:57.368 --> 00:02:01.535
out that Paul McCartney died, right, he passed away,

39
00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:05.229
and he was replaced with a look alike.

40
00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.517
And you can actually see this in the album cover.

41
00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:10.947
That John Lennon here is dressed in white,

42
00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:12.888
which means he's a priest, right,

43
00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:17.368
Ringo, the drummer, is the pallbearer, right,

44
00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:21.669
pallbearer, which means that he carries the coffin.

45
00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.859
Paul is in bare feet, right, because he passed away

46
00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.928
and this is fictitious, of course, right,

47
00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:29.197
and he's actually smoking so that kind of

48
00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:32.709
indicates he, it's not a good thing, you can die from that.

49
00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.567
And then here we have George Harrison who is the

50
00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.419
grave digger, right, so they paid a lot of attention

51
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.627
to detail in this, it's a real masterpiece.

52
00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:45.710
And all this passed the so what test.

53
00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:50.774
It's very relevant to the theme of Paul having passed away.

54
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.437
Right, fictitiously, again.

55
00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:55.447
One more thing I want to show you, right.

56
00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:58.848
I don't know if you can see that there, try to zoom in.

57
00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:00.619
Right there, on that license plate, right, the license

58
00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:04.436
plate right here of the Beetle, Volkswagen Beetle,

59
00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.353
clever, it says 28IF, you see that?

60
00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.448
That means that if Paul McCartney was still alive, right,

61
00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.069
again it's just pretend, if he was still alive,

62
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.107
he would be 28 years old.

63
00:03:16.107 --> 00:03:17.880
Isn't that neat.

64
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.200
It was really, really cool and this was very

65
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.078
controversial at the time because people thought

66
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:26.078
that Paul McCartney had passed away.

67
00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:28.483
There's a lot of controversy and controversy

68
00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:31.648
usually leads to increased media attention

69
00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:33.269
which leads to increased sales.

70
00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.228
Isn't that brilliant?

71
00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:35.549
The Beatles back then, they knew what they were doing.

72
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.808
It was a brilliant PR event, right.

73
00:03:38.808 --> 00:03:41.229
Kind of like Steve Jobs, whenever he would present

74
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:45.127
at Apple, right, it was a brilliant PR event.

75
00:03:45.127 --> 00:03:48.098
It was a masterpiece of a presentation

76
00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:50.265
that Mr. Jobs gave, right.

77
00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:52.544
It's amazing how these people introduced him

78
00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:53.544
quite a bit.

79
00:03:56.308 --> 00:03:58.109
The attention to detail to make sure that

80
00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.139
everything is relevant and a masterpiece

81
00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.160
like your presentation is, is crucial and your speech

82
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.410
is going to be an absolute masterpiece.

83
00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.579
Including the images you're going to use.

84
00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.326
And the optional music and videos which we will

85
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.659
cover in act four scene two.

86
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.611
So, what, Chris?

87
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:22.800
Well, I want you to be as detailed and creative

88
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.011
with your masterpiece of a presentation

89
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:27.312
as George Martin was.

90
00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:30.472
Course he was the producer of The Beatles.

91
00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:35.192
And he put this music on this album in order, in order.

92
00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.701
He was brilliant, he was brilliant, right.

93
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:40.571
And you gotta wear a lot of hats when you're

94
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:45.192
creating your masterpiece of a speech or presentation.

95
00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:46.971
So, I want you think like, I want you to think

96
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:49.811
like the greatest producers, the greatest content

97
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.381
writers, the greatest artists, etc. when you make

98
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:54.214
your production, okay.

99
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.661
Remember we want it to be an experience,

100
00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:00.730
right, not just a boring presentation.

101
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.390
And make sure that the order of the topics

102
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.390
that you discuss in your presentation flows well.

103
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.392
Actually, let's talk about this, might be interesting.

104
00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:12.540
How did Beatles producer, George Martin,

105
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.918
order the songs on Abbey Road here.

106
00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:18.258
And in the old days, there was two songs,

107
00:05:18.258 --> 00:05:19.699
they were clever and used both sides, right,

108
00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.866
to an album, there's side one and side two, right.

109
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.220
And when you bought singles or just one song

110
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.219
on an album, the great song would be on side A

111
00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.198
and leftover stuff would be on side B, B side, right.

112
00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:36.499
But George Martin likely put the album's, the song

113
00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.558
in the order that he thought would be most popular first.

114
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:43.569
And so the first song here is actually Come Together,

115
00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.929
right, on side A or side one.

116
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.478
And that was played a lot on the radio,

117
00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:51.318
it was a very popular song, it was commercialized.

118
00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.468
And the album flows really well because

119
00:05:53.468 --> 00:05:56.649
in the second half or the second side

120
00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.149
is probably the most compelling collection

121
00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:05.337
of songs that flow together that's ever been created

122
00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:08.026
in music history in my humble opinion.

123
00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:10.458
Each song flows beautifully.

124
00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.948
And it's remarkable, magnificent, medley of

125
00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:17.058
music and the melancholy, emotional feeling

126
00:06:17.058 --> 00:06:20.028
of it sounds like the perfect way to end

127
00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:22.419
their career together.

128
00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.428
Why do I say this?

129
00:06:23.428 --> 00:06:26.329
This was basically their last album they did, okay.

130
00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:27.598
Some people say Let It Be was,

131
00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:30.660
but it was actually this one, right.

132
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.860
And the very last song here is a song called The End.

133
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.438
Which is actually, it's a very sad song.

134
00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:39.460
It's near the end of the album, I should say.

135
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.057
And it's the antithesis of coming together,

136
00:06:42.057 --> 00:06:45.420
right, which was at the start of the album.

137
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.566
Right, it's a masterpiece, it's an absolute masterpiece

138
00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:54.348
work of art, kind of like your presentation will be.

139
00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:57.238
And if you get a chance, please listen to the

140
00:06:57.238 --> 00:07:01.289
second half of the album, starting with Here Comes the Sun.

141
00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.227
And then Because which George Harrison wrote.

142
00:07:03.227 --> 00:07:06.107
And then it flows nicely into a song eventually

143
00:07:06.107 --> 00:07:09.828
called The Sun King where he speaks Portuguese.

144
00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:11.460
Polythene Pam, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,

145
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.706
Carry That Weight, and then The End at the end.

146
00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:15.356
It's pretty interesting and again it's almost sad

147
00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:18.388
because it's the end of The Beatles,

148
00:07:18.388 --> 00:07:20.025
it's the end of an era basically.

149
00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:21.889
It marks the end of the '60s.

150
00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:23.958
And at the end of the album,

151
00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.918
you just want to stand up and clap as this is

152
00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:30.438
the emotional feel that I want your audience to feel.

153
00:07:30.438 --> 00:07:31.969
Hold on, someone's here at the door.

154
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:32.802
Who is it?

155
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:37.734
(inaudible)

156
00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:45.030
This is my son, Matthew, hey Matt, how are you buddy?

157
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.863
Good.

158
00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:46.696
Can you say hi?

159
00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:47.921
Come closer so everyone can see you.

160
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:49.589
Here you go.

161
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.881
And Matthew actually had, I had writer's block

162
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:56.121
and Matthew when you can't think of something,

163
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:57.214
what do you do?

164
00:07:57.214 --> 00:07:59.229
You play around with something, what is it?

165
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.841
It's called a spinner.

166
00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:02.990
A spinner, okay, cool, neat.

167
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.780
And okay good, so when you have writer's block

168
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.940
you can use this, too, right.

169
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.380
It's a spinner, it's, isn't that cool?

170
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.469
This thing can spin for a couple of minutes.

171
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:14.804
And then you had this one, as well, what is this?

172
00:08:14.804 --> 00:08:18.270
Show this to, say hi to everyone at (inaudible).

173
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.692
Hello, this is called a fidget cube,

174
00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:24.212
when you're bored in class and you have nothing to

175
00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.639
do you can just play around, it's like clicking a pen

176
00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.550
but there's lots more options.

177
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.281
Cool, very neat, very neat.

178
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:35.279
That's awesome and I was bored in class a lot.

179
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.980
That's neat, that's great, so, alright great,

180
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.641
well thanks buddy.

181
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:42.092
Excellent, thanks for showing me.

182
00:08:42.092 --> 00:08:43.700
Can I keep this for a little while?

183
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.092
Yeah.

184
00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:46.161
Alright, I love you, thanks buddy.

185
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:46.994
You, too.

186
00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:47.921
Thanks.

187
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:49.840
Alright, cool.

188
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.757
Unscripted.

189
00:08:52.252 --> 00:08:53.252
Cool, thanks buddy, can you close the door?

190
00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:54.732
Thank you.

191
00:08:54.732 --> 00:08:58.200
Okay great, alright, so, anyway, what else

192
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.938
can I tell you about this album.

193
00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:03.900
Oh, on the back cover here, it's pretty neat.

194
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.380
Paul they thought was dead and this kind of

195
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.630
represents a sinister person or whatever it is,

196
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.298
the shadow, so what, Chris, so what.

197
00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:14.852
Anyway, I just want to make sure that your

198
00:09:14.852 --> 00:09:17.951
presentation is an absolute masterpiece.

199
00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:19.803
Now, it's important for me to stress that

200
00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:22.004
The Beatles were in their 20s then

201
00:09:22.004 --> 00:09:25.497
and all the best artists, in my humble opinion,

202
00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:27.702
make their best stuff in their 20s.

203
00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:29.700
So, those of you that are under 30,

204
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.772
please don't ever let your age or lack

205
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.833
of experience intimidate you.

206
00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:37.233
The way you approach problem solving

207
00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:39.724
and creativity is awesome because you haven't

208
00:09:39.724 --> 00:09:41.953
been told how to think yet.

209
00:09:41.953 --> 00:09:43.950
Okay, okay, okay.

210
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.601
Let's get back to The Beatles now and thematics in general.

211
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:51.972
So, I wanted to also mention, I think I made a mistake

212
00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:54.441
there that this is the grim reaper, right, that's

213
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:56.941
what they were trying to show.

214
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.372
And the image of, for this Abbey Road presentation

215
00:10:01.372 --> 00:10:04.190
by The Beatles is certainly convincing,

216
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.641
interesting, different, educational, and relevant.

217
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.140
Especially when compared to the less sophisticated,

218
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.828
but still awesome, earlier albums by The Beatles,

219
00:10:14.828 --> 00:10:16.328
before Abbey Road.

220
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:22.058
And your production pieces or your presentation

221
00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:25.721
will become more sophisticated as you go on.

222
00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:28.520
You know, if I look at earlier stuff by The Beatles,

223
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.028
like this one here, Rubber Soul, which is great.

224
00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:33.692
It's not as sophisticated, right, everything about

225
00:10:33.692 --> 00:10:36.932
it is just less sophisticated, right.

226
00:10:36.932 --> 00:10:40.349
And so, anyway, I think you get the idea.

227
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.612
Now, another great artistic way of making clever

228
00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:49.321
images or memes if you want to tie in your content together

229
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:52.988
is to go to this website here to make memes.

230
00:10:55.528 --> 00:10:58.709
And again, The Beatles were amazing as they made

231
00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:01.608
every single album different.

232
00:11:01.608 --> 00:11:04.120
They were incredibly unique.

233
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.562
Damn this lecture is fun, I'm having a good time.

234
00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:08.926
I'm not gonna edit it all.

235
00:11:08.926 --> 00:11:13.606
Okay so, enough talk about themes and scenes and memes.

236
00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.720
I think you get the idea, just please pay close

237
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.387
attention to dealing with detail

238
00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:21.837
and more than anything just have a lot of

239
00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:25.867
fun doing this, right, creating your masterpiece.

240
00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:29.128
And be different, again, your audience might forget

241
00:11:29.128 --> 00:11:31.018
what you say, but they'll never forget the

242
00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:33.618
way you made them feel.

243
00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:34.535
Thank you.
