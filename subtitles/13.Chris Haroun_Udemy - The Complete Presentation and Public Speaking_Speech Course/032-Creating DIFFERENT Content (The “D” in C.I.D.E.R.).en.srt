1
00:00:00,807 --> 00:00:04,435
Please try to make the content of your speech different.

2
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:07,384
Make the experience you're going to give your audience

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:10,498
incredibly unique and creative, okay?

4
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:15,303
Make your presentation new, fresh, exciting, and different,

5
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:17,318
because, you know, you're different from everybody else,

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:20,160
because you're you and everybody loves you,

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,321
because you act like you.

8
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,459
So, just be different, which means, be you.

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,588
Now, I came up with the idea of CIDER,

10
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:30,843
that's C.I.D.E.R., for content,

11
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:33,093
by using this website here.

12
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:38,093
Okay, so, check it out and you can come up with your own

13
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:42,822
types of ideas for creating a somewhat unique experience,

14
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:45,229
like I did with CIDER.

15
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,108
So, please try using this concept in your presentation,

16
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,363
if you want.

17
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:51,013
You know, create a number of topics,

18
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:54,523
and then, take the first letter of each of those topics

19
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:56,675
and use this website to make the content

20
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,919
of your presentation more fun to create and present, okay?

21
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,612
And we'll talk about slide structure

22
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:05,399
and creating slides in Act Four of this course, okay?

23
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,062
Now, you want to create content

24
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:08,998
that is groundbreaking, right?

25
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:11,219
And, thought provoking as well.

26
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,858
So, take your time with this.

27
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:15,261
You know, it took me close to a year

28
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:16,921
to write my TEDx talk,

29
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:20,004
and several months to make my wedding speech.

30
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:21,120
Alright, it took a long time.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,490
And, we'll cover both of these topics in much more detail

32
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,798
in Act 11 of this course when we talk about

33
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:30,288
25 different types of presentations.

34
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:31,893
Okay.

35
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,386
Think of yourself

36
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:36,205
like you are an artist, right?

37
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:37,982
Remember, these artists don't feel like

38
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,949
they have a job, okay?

39
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:43,846
They have a passion, and a passion to create.

40
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:46,300
If you want to do the same thing

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,885
when you're writing your content,

42
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:50,223
then just kind of think like an artist

43
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,233
and be creative, okay?

44
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,334
Now, think of yourself like an artist.

45
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,727
Now, just remember, these artists don't feel like they're

46
00:01:56,727 --> 00:02:00,451
working again, they have a passion, and a passion to create,

47
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,898
and I want you to do the exact same thing

48
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:05,039
when writing your content, okay?

49
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,218
And, if you want, again, please revisit our Journal Exercise

50
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:10,791
number two, which is called Emotions and Experiences to

51
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,695
Include in your Speech.

52
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:13,528
And,

53
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:18,316
you're being creative, so be like these artists,

54
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:20,253
as this is not work,

55
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:23,075
it's authentic creation of a masterpiece.

56
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,248
So, enjoy it,

57
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:26,881
and this goes for everything you create in business

58
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,413
and in life.

59
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:31,496
Be yourself, no matter what they say.

60
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,917
People feel uncomfortable when you're not you.

61
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:40,278
People feel more comfortable when you are you, right?

62
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:44,213
It's a win-win as you get to be yourself

63
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,433
and other people appreciate when you're just,

64
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,695
when you're you and you present,

65
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:49,796
and it's less work, right?

66
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,450
Otherwise, if you aren't you, if you're not you,

67
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,367
then it's a lose-lose situation

68
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:58,070
as you and the audience doesn't feel comfortable.

69
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,997
And, again, senior executives actually feel uncomfortable

70
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:05,985
and they like us less when we are not ourselves.

71
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,804
So, just be different, be you, it's easier.

72
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,413
Okay, and again, your peers and your subordinates,

73
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,439
people who work for you,

74
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,261
will appreciate it too.

75
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,844
Okay, so let's stop repressing,

76
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,219
you know, who you are

77
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,085
and now, have the freedom to express yourself with

78
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,963
passion when you present.

79
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,018
You be you, as it's easier,

80
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:30,185
and it has a much better result, okay?

81
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:34,075
People will remember you for being different.

82
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:34,908
And,

83
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,872
as a Canadian, I have to mention the late, great

84
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:43,021
Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, right?

85
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,438
He was authentic.

86
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:46,969
If you are like everyone else,

87
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,453
you won't stand out when you present,

88
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,913
and one presentation perfectly executed

89
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,282
can change your life.

90
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,460
And, Pierre Trudeau was our Prime Minister

91
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,480
for 15 years, right?

92
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,915
Most people don't know that.

93
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:02,701
He was our Prime Minister for 15 years,

94
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,861
which is almost twice as long as

95
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,303
Reagan was President at the same time.

96
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:09,921
And, Pierre Trudeau was himself,

97
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:13,601
and he even gave the media the finger one day, apparently.

98
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,232
I don't think you should do that, but he didn't care.

99
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:17,675
He was just him.

100
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,383
And, the last thing, (laughs)

101
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:21,754
the last thing I'll say is that Batman would never

102
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,087
give the finger.

103
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,740
(clears throat) Yeah, okay.

104
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,775
(chuckles) Be different and real.

105
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,084
Kind of like,

106
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:34,549
kind of like Han Solo, and not C-3PO, right?

107
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,626
I mean, this guy's name was a number, 3PO, for a reason.

108
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:41,292
The same with Data from Star Trek versus Kirk.

109
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,877
His name is synonymous with unemotion, Data.

110
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,907
You know, Han Solo is emotional

111
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:49,313
and the audience likes that more.

112
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:50,146
Be you.
