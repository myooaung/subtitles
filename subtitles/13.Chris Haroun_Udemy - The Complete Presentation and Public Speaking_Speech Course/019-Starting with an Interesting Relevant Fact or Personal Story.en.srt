1
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:03,524
Starting with an interesting or relevant fact,

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:05,024
or personal story.

3
00:00:06,268 --> 00:00:09,199
This is my first visit to your beautiful city.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,646
I arrived yesterday, and I took a walk

5
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:15,047
through the stunning old part of town.

6
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:18,139
Many of you recognize this symbol.

7
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:22,306
It's from Frank and Jimmy's Barbershop at 121 Dundas Street.

8
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,500
I asked Frank why most barbershops have a pole

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,229
that's red and white with blue stripes,

10
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:33,146
and he told me that many years ago,

11
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:36,500
when you wanted to get surgery done,

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,842
in ancient times, Europe or whatever,

13
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:43,480
you went to the barbershop, and what happened was

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,293
after the surgeon, who worked at a barbershop,

15
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:51,148
would do surgery on you, they had these blue towels,

16
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:55,703
blue and white towels, and then what they would do is,

17
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:58,457
they'd use the towel to clean up the surgery,

18
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:01,881
clean the towels, and then hang them up outside on a pole,

19
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:04,466
and the wind would wrap them up in those three colors.

20
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:06,159
That's why it's red, white, and blue.

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,582
Anyway, thought that was an interesting story

22
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:10,291
to share with you all.

23
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,659
Okay, remember the so what thing, right?

24
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,996
Just like Frank and Jimmy's Barbershop,

25
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:18,444
your company has the same family type,

26
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,867
warm culture feel to it.

27
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,959
Your company is rich in tradition,

28
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,720
and was also founded in 1879.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,546
So starting with an interesting fact,

30
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,772
and then putting it into context

31
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,510
with the purpose of your product,

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,051
is a different way to start a speech.

33
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,144
Remember the so what test, too.

34
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:41,977
It's got to be relevant, and if you want,

35
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,822
go to your success journal, and look at what

36
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:49,141
you documented as the purpose of your speech,

37
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,787
and the audience exercise as well,

38
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:54,813
and see if you can start your presentation

39
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,694
with something that might appeal to emotions, et cetera,

40
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:00,516
some sort of cool story.

41
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:03,971
And if you tell a story, again make sure to always

42
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:05,135
make sure it's relevant.

43
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:07,718
Ask yourself, the so what test.

44
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,237
Here's another example.

45
00:02:12,237 --> 00:02:16,478
This watch is not made of gold or silver,

46
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:19,053
it's made of stainless steel.

47
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:22,136
On May 14, 2016 in Geneva, this Rolex

48
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:26,742
was sold for 2.5 million dollars.

49
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:31,429
Now if you took apart this watch,

50
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:33,886
and melted down the components,

51
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:38,186
the resale value would be very, very small.

52
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:43,057
It's the sentimental value of an earlier time in history

53
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:47,224
that makes this watch worth more than the sum of its parts.

54
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:52,969
Similarly, our customers have valued our product,

55
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,612
and the emotional bond they have with it

56
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:58,153
for several generations.

57
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:02,176
Our product is respected and appreciated

58
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:04,884
by generations of our loyal customers.

59
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,942
Our product is genuine.

60
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,580
It's precise.

61
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,747
Our product has impeccable quality, and it's timeless.

62
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:17,625
Separately, when you tell a personal story,

63
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,962
it's so natural and much more passionate,

64
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:24,369
and you usually get hired by a company

65
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:29,091
if people enjoy your company as they see you as real

66
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,593
in an interview, and not over rehearsed.

67
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:36,760
So here's how I personalized a speech I gave recently

68
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:42,588
at Stanford Business School on finance and accounting.

69
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:46,118
I'm here to teach you about finance and accounting,

70
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:49,611
but before I get started, I want you all to know

71
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:53,332
that I got a D in accounting the first time I took it.

72
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,611
What I learned was, I got a D

73
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,374
because I memorized accounting concepts.

74
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,661
You need to understand them first,

75
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,567
and then you will remember them.

76
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,015
And what I wanted to talk to you about today

77
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,742
at Stanford is, yada, yada, yada.

78
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:08,685
You get the idea.

79
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,522
Just make sure please, that your story is

80
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:14,771
somewhat contextually relevant.

81
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,574
Separately, this is not a political course, whatever,

82
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:21,450
but check out the speech from Obama when he tells a story

83
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,117
with no preparation on his life.

84
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:27,360
His delivery is not as polished in this one

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,515
as it usually is because he's very exhausted,

86
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,098
but it's very real.

87
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,300
Check it out.
