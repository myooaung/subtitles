00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:04.597
TED Talks are usually less than 10 to 15 minutes or so

2
00:00:04.597 --> 00:00:07.613
partially because we just can't concentrate

3
00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:09.974
for that long anymore.

4
00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.089
There's so many competing alternatives and distractions

5
00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.748
when you're presenting up there,

6
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:18.274
like smartphones, tablets, laptops,

7
00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:21.281
and even some people wearing Google Glass

8
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.316
which we call glassholes.

9
00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:24.385
Just kidding.

10
00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:27.525
And it's only gonna get worse with virtual reality,

11
00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.252
augmented reality, whatever.

12
00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:31.447
It's not gonna get better.

13
00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:34.936
And so, when I teach in class at universities,

14
00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:37.728
I love showing little video clips or images

15
00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:40.152
every five or 10 minutes in order to make

16
00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:41.514
the overall presentation experience

17
00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:43.738
just much more enjoyable.

18
00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:47.551
And the measure of how great of a movie for me is

19
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:49.896
when I go to the theater

20
00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:53.205
and I don't look at my watch even one time

21
00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:55.941
the whole movie, which is very rare.

22
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:58.020
But when that happens, it's a great movie.

23
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.853
Great for me.

24
00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:01.427
For example, recently with my son Andrew,

25
00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.239
we went to go see Rogue One,

26
00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.624
which was actually my favorite Star Wars movie.

27
00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:07.898
I think 'cause my expectations were quite low,

28
00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:11.414
and I didn't check my watch once during that whole movie.

29
00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:14.090
Same thing with Avatar.

30
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.318
And in act number seven,

31
00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:19.976
we're gonna talk about reading the audience

32
00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:22.842
and trying to make sure that they are more engaged.

33
00:01:22.842 --> 00:01:24.373
And if they're not engaged,

34
00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:27.376
then I'll teach you how to change your style immediately

35
00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.399
or skip to the next topic

36
00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.340
so that they're always engaged.

37
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.730
And so, please take a risk

38
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.313
and show short video clips or a funny meme.
