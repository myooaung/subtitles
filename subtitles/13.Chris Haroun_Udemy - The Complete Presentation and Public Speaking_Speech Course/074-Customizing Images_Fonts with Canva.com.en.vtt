00:00:00.707 --> 00:00:04.874
I wanna show you a quick demo of Canva.com.

2
00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:09.884
And this is actually a pretty cool website to design

3
00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:13.247
presentations, but I want to show you some of the images

4
00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.753
you can use here as well and a lot of them are free,

5
00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:19.298
and then they try to upsell you, which is to be expected.

6
00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:20.796
Okay, cool.

7
00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:23.379
So let's create a presentation.

8
00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:27.377
And again I'm gonna try to focus a little bit more on images

9
00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:29.878
here, moreso than anything else.

10
00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:33.045
Okay so let's grab this template here.

11
00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:36.516
It's kinda cool.

12
00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:38.425
And I'll just change around very quickly and I'll show

13
00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:39.628
you images, okay.

14
00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:43.232
So the fonts are actually very nice, alright.

15
00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:45.737
You can select any type of font you want remember to

16
00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:50.101
try and stay consistent within each presentation.

17
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:54.268
The new you, looks like a romance one here, sale, etc.

18
00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.443
So it'll pop, that sort of thing.

19
00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:02.243
Let's add a new page, very quickly.

20
00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:05.614
And you can add new slides with different types of layout

21
00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.832
as well which is quite nice, alright.

22
00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:10.131
Okay.

23
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.709
Now, for backgrounds, you can select customized ones

24
00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.948
as well, right, and then they try to upsell you for

25
00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:18.031
cooler stuff.

26
00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:23.490
So say we wanted to put in a chart you can do that as well.

27
00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:27.080
And they're actually pretty nice and you can customize

28
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.584
it your self as well.

29
00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:32.417
Lots of different types of charts.

30
00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:37.459
You can get quite busy as well, you got your diagrams here.

31
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.835
And then for icons you can throw in a bunch as well

32
00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.542
again they have a lot of free cool stuff for ya.

33
00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:49.872
That's neat, that works in most presentations.

34
00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:53.094
Put that up in the corner if you want or whatever.

35
00:01:53.094 --> 00:01:54.594
And they also have

36
00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:59.362
illustrations you can use.

37
00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:00.779
Swiss army knife,

38
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.008
Saturn,

39
00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:10.693
the eight-bit Nintendo, I remember that form the 80s.

40
00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.250
Let's get another page here.

41
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.810
And I'll show you just really quickly images here.

42
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.825
You can search for photos as well as over a million pictures

43
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:19.684
you can use.

44
00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:23.473
So let's say we want ocean, say we want ocean on the

45
00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:27.084
right side, yeah, you can throw that there.

46
00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:28.417
Go back to text,

47
00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:33.099
put this here, type in whatever you want.

48
00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:38.330
And you can actually also customize the images as well.

49
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.978
And I had another tab open here, so this is similar

50
00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:45.033
to Instagram, you can customize any pictures you want,

51
00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:49.200
upload your own, resize, crop, adjust, that sort of thing,

52
00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:51.321
flip.

53
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:54.283
So it's pretty powerful, I'm not gonna spend too much

54
00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:57.019
time on this but it's yet another tool for you to use

55
00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.176
for not just presentations but also for manipulating images.

56
00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:04.251
And say that you manipulated an image and you don't

57
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:08.101
wanna use it here you wanna use it in say Powerpoint

58
00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:09.451
or Keynote.

59
00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:11.612
What you can do is this.

60
00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:16.013
You use the snip control on Windows, or you do the

61
00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:20.180
string picture control on Apple which is command shift #4,

62
00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:24.038
and then you copy,

63
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.452
and whenever you do screen print on a Mac, what it does

64
00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:32.014
for a lot of people is it adds it directly to your desktop.

65
00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:34.268
You can customize that too.

66
00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:37.650
In Windows, it's actually easier cause when you use the

67
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.776
screen print option, hit you know control print screen,

68
00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:43.210
or the snipping tool I mentioned, it actually

69
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.211
puts it in the clipboard and you just hit paste.

70
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:51.159
So anyway, you can take manipulated images from Canva

71
00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.092
and put it in other applications as well, and you could even

72
00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:58.595
if you wanted to, heck, get the whole screen, right.

73
00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:02.597
You'll insert a new slide, you right click, new slide

74
00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:04.264
and then you insert.

75
00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:09.329
And again I'm trying to give you a menu of anything

76
00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.078
you can possibly do within reason, when you present.

77
00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:16.171
And then you choose whatever applications make more sense

78
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:17.288
to you.

79
00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:18.324
So you get the idea.

80
00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:21.088
That's Canva, it's free to use.

81
00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:23.223
And then there's more premium feature, which again

82
00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:24.504
is to be expected.

83
00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:25.337
Thanks.
