00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:02.608
How do we know what to wear?

2
00:00:02.608 --> 00:00:04.626
What are the resources?

3
00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:07.640
If you're presenting in front of another company,

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.688
call your contact at that company

5
00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:11.666
and ask them what you should wear,

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.911
or send them a text,

7
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.744
or check out what people wear on their website

8
00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:22.776
or just search glassdoor.com if it's applicable.

9
00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:26.859
Sometimes LinkedIn profile pictures work as well.

10
00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:29.907
If you can, check to see if someone's wearing

11
00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:32.312
a tie in their pictures on LinkedIn.

12
00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.113
Doesn't always work.

13
00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:35.241
Actually this is important.

14
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.385
If you're close to getting promoted

15
00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:39.530
and you're presenting at your company

16
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.212
I want you to dress a bit like the person or people

17
00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:46.098
at the level above you.

18
00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:49.687
Because I want people to think of you

19
00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:52.298
as being on the next level.

20
00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:54.756
It's kind of like when you're in an interview for a job.

21
00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:56.874
If you can prove to them you can already do the job

22
00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:59.671
then that's how you get hired, that sort of thing.

23
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.038
Separately,

24
00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:03.516
if in doubt overdress,

25
00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.099
meaning wear a tie.

26
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.304
When you arrive ask somebody at the security desk

27
00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:11.510
or someone that works at the company

28
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.024
if a tie is needed and if not take it off.

29
00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:17.859
The people at the security desk are always very cool.

30
00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.116
I find that, this is off topic a bit,

31
00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:23.360
in companies I've worked for a couple of big ones,

32
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.798
the assistants are so awesome to get to know

33
00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:29.724
because they're cool and they also know how the game works.

34
00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.136
They understand the culture

35
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:33.469
and they can help you a lot.

36
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.544
Let's move on.

37
00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:37.168
Make sure that you iron your clothes

38
00:01:37.168 --> 00:01:40.549
or use that steamer thing I showed you, the day before.

39
00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.107
I made the mistake once of ironing, years ago

40
00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:47.521
my shirt at a hotel a half hour before I presented.

41
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.597
Never ever put on a shirt ironed

42
00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:52.510
right after you iron it or it won't stay ironed.

43
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.948
Moving on.

44
00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:56.281
Shoes are important as well.

45
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:00.104
They have to match your belt

46
00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:05.037
and they have to match your shirt if applicable as well.

47
00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:06.455
Not in all cases.

48
00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:09.056
Again, make sure that your shoe bottoms are soft

49
00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:11.112
so that when you walk on the stage

50
00:02:11.112 --> 00:02:15.329
people don't just focus on the noise you're making.

51
00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.022
If you have issues with your fashion sense

52
00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:22.462
which I clearly do, except my hats are cool.

53
00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:24.898
Then ask your parents or your significant other

54
00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:28.716
or even a salesperson at a clothing store to help you out.

55
00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:30.667
But be careful because they all work

56
00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:33.655
on commission or they might.

57
00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:37.232
We spend all this time looking great at our wedding

58
00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:39.263
which is the most important day of our life

59
00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:41.233
or one of the most important days.

60
00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:44.260
Your speech day is a close second in terms of importance

61
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.639
because one speech can change your life.

62
00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.638
Please spend a lot of time

63
00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:51.640
picking the perfect clothes to wear.

64
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.389
Just be careful.

65
00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:54.796
Don't wear this either.

66
00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:56.606
Don't dress like that.

67
00:02:56.606 --> 00:02:58.722
Sorry I must have seen this movie, Dumb and Dumber

68
00:02:58.722 --> 00:03:01.034
at least ten times, I know every line.

69
00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.034
Hi I'm seven, man-child.

70
00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:07.694
If you're presenting in another country

71
00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:09.281
please ask somebody familiar with the culture

72
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.632
what colors to wear and what not to wear.

73
00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:14.408
There's certain colors that are offensive.

74
00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:16.406
I think that the least offensive color

75
00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:18.681
at least for fonts when I'm presenting,

76
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:19.730
I researched this,

77
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.832
it's online so it's true,

78
00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:22.566
I read it online it's true,

79
00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.589
is the color blue, blue is okay.

80
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.794
Do your research.

81
00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.920
Bring backup shirts, et cetera in case.

82
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.763
Hang your jacket in your car if you're driving there.

83
00:03:31.763 --> 00:03:35.861
Don't put it on until you arrive at the location.

84
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.084
Wear layers just in case

85
00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:40.473
the presentation room is too hot or too cold.

86
00:03:40.473 --> 00:03:43.386
If they're gonna put a wireless microphone on your chest

87
00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:46.031
don't wear jewelry that makes too much noise.
