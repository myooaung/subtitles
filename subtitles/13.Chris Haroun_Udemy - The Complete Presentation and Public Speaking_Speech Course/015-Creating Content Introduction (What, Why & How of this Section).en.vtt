1
00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:16.090
Welcome to act number three,

2
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.001
creating the content.

3
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.790
Now that we know who the audience is

4
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.594
and what the purpose is of our presentation,

5
00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.869
let's talk about creating the content of our presentation.

6
00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.329
I love this section, okay.

7
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.570
You get to be very creative here, it's exhilarating.

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.130
And once we have perfected your content,

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.162
meaning what we are going to say,

10
00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.712
then in the next act, which is act four,

11
00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:41.499
we can create the slides, right,

12
00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.964
if you're using slides, that is.

13
00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:47.319
Now in terms of the what of this current act,

14
00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.099
which is act three,

15
00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:52.470
there's four different sections or scenes, as follows.

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.940
In act three, scene one,

17
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.248
we're going to talk about the best ways

18
00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:59.308
to start our presentation or our speech

19
00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:03.485
by writing an incredible starting content portion

20
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:04.891
of our speech, okay.

21
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.753
And we're going to spend a lot of time

22
00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:07.952
on starting our speech

23
00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:09.840
because you never get a second chance

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.340
to make that first impression.

25
00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.609
And in act three, scene two,

26
00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.579
after we're done with the start of our speech,

27
00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.439
in scene two we're going to talk about

28
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.409
the middle content part of our speech,

29
00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.459
meaning what to include,

30
00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:28.280
as well as how to structure the speech or presentation.

31
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.779
And then in act three, scene three,

32
00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.018
we're going to talk about the best way

33
00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:33.703
to end our speech or presentation

34
00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:37.870
by creating very, very impactful final content, okay.

35
00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.348
And then in act three, scene four,

36
00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:43.433
we're going to talk about how to get feedback

37
00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.833
on the content of your speech before you create the slides

38
00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.675
and before you work on the delivery, okay.

39
00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.854
In terms of the why, we need to have a separate act

40
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.215
for creating the content,

41
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.127
a separate act for creating the slides,

42
00:01:56.127 --> 00:01:58.234
and a separate act for creating the delivery.

43
00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:00.564
Well, I analyzed the,

44
00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:01.565
this was a lot of fun,

45
00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:05.966
I analyzed the top musicians and the top movies.

46
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:09.151
And singers often write the music

47
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.487
and the lyrics separately.

48
00:02:11.487 --> 00:02:14.320
Similarly, movies are made, right,

49
00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.423
but writing the script comes first

50
00:02:18.423 --> 00:02:19.912
and then you pick the actors later

51
00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:22.513
and then you work on post-production, right,

52
00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:25.452
kind of like make a you to me course, okay.

53
00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:28.718
And so this is why I want to cover the content of our speech

54
00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:32.434
before discussing the slide structure in act four,

55
00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:35.392
and then our delivery later on in the course.

56
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:36.402
Now in terms of the,

57
00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:39.603
"How are we going to create the content?"

58
00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:44.412
Well, we're going to look at great quotes to start a speech.

59
00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:45.537
We're also going to look at

60
00:02:45.537 --> 00:02:49.224
how to structure brilliant, unstructured ideas

61
00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:50.894
so that your speech is organized,

62
00:02:50.894 --> 00:02:54.416
so we can create slides and then the delivery, okay.

63
00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:57.374
And there's many, many, many different examples

64
00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:00.163
in this very long section, okay.

65
00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:01.604
We're going to discuss

66
00:03:01.604 --> 00:03:03.764
how you can stand out from other speakers,

67
00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:05.975
how you can be different, okay.

68
00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:07.913
And we're also going to talk about

69
00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:10.246
dealing with writer's block

70
00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:12.458
and how to really get inspired

71
00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.285
to create your masterpiece of a speech.

72
00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:16.314
And please remember,

73
00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:19.435
the life often comes down to a few short moments,

74
00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:22.407
and one of these moments is your speech.

75
00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:24.693
Personally, this is just me,

76
00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:28.393
I spend 60 to 90 minutes preparing for my speech

77
00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:31.563
for each one minute of time in my speech.

78
00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:34.603
For example, if my speech is going to be 10 minutes long,

79
00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:37.753
I would usually spend 600 to 900 minutes

80
00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:41.266
or 10 to 15 hours preparing for my speech, at a minimum.

81
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:42.866
And it used to be a lot longer when I was younger,

82
00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.868
before I learned this stuff that I'm going to teach you.

83
00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:47.234
And again, I want to teach you to work smarter

84
00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:51.003
and not harder, and not to make the same mistakes I made.

85
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:52.974
If it's a game-changing speech

86
00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:55.234
for my career or my personal life,

87
00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:58.555
I will literally spend 100 to 200 minutes

88
00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:02.563
preparing for each minute in a 10 minute speech.

89
00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:04.389
And you can do the math there, it's a lot,

90
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.170
but it's totally, totally worth it.

91
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.589
Why so long?

92
00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.148
Because one speech can change everything.

93
00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:13.329
And sometimes life all comes down to a few short moments

94
00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.841
and often, business is war,

95
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.999
and every battle is won before it's been fought.

96
00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.055
Now in terms of understanding how long your speech will be

97
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:24.979
when you deliver it,

98
00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.257
if you were to type your speech outline

99
00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:30.722
or all of the text, which is optional,

100
00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:32.335
do what you want to do,

101
00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:33.244
and you want to find out

102
00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:37.035
how long the speech is going to be when you say it.

103
00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:39.414
You basically, you count up the number of words, right,

104
00:04:39.414 --> 00:04:42.965
Microsoft Word, you can go to count words, whatever,

105
00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:44.276
and then you go to a website called

106
00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:48.040
www.speechinminutes.com

107
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.179
speechinminutes.com to see how long your speech will be.

108
00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:56.290
And I actually find that my actual speech

109
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.392
is about 10% shorter, timewise,

110
00:05:00.392 --> 00:05:02.211
when I practiced,

111
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:05.186
as I sometimes forget to include a few items.

112
00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:06.772
And nobody ever notices, anyway.

113
00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:09.321
And if you forget stuff, no one's going to know, okay.

114
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:11.812
And sometimes I speak a bit faster when I present

115
00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.398
which, again it's an issue

116
00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:16.630
and I'm trying to work on this, okay.

117
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.976
You can never be perfect enough when you speak,

118
00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:20.638
I'm trying so hard, okay.

119
00:05:20.638 --> 00:05:23.429
So when we watch videos of me presenting,

120
00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:25.440
I'll often critique myself, okay.

121
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.589
And again, I want you to present better than the competition

122
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:29.427
and better than me.

123
00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:32.227
And so we're going to critique me a bunch, okay.

124
00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:33.567
We're going to spend a lot of time

125
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.017
on starting your presentation or speech

126
00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:38.139
because if you lose the audience

127
00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.838
in the early part of your presentation,

128
00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:42.490
then it's really, really hard to get that back, okay.

129
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.679
Because the smartphones went, okay.

130
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.817
And it's interesting because, you know,

131
00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:48.678
movies today I've noticed

132
00:05:48.678 --> 00:05:51.488
start much faster than they used to.

133
00:05:51.488 --> 00:05:53.378
You know, it starts with action right away,

134
00:05:53.378 --> 00:05:55.715
like the Fast and Furious franchise.

135
00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:58.244
I actually showed my kids The Wizard of Oz,

136
00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:01.024
which I watched as a kid when we had three channels on TV,

137
00:06:01.024 --> 00:06:02.614
I am old, okay,

138
00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:05.074
and my kids were bored to tears, right.

139
00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:08.458
They said, "Dad! You put the movie on

140
00:06:08.458 --> 00:06:10.603
but it's over already!"

141
00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:12.343
Right, and it's funny they said that

142
00:06:12.343 --> 00:06:15.753
because they way it used to be with movies,

143
00:06:15.753 --> 00:06:17.097
they'd have words at the beginning,

144
00:06:17.097 --> 00:06:19.139
like, "Starring Judy Garland"

145
00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.532
or whatever it is, okay.

146
00:06:20.532 --> 00:06:23.553
And the movies that people like today, you know,

147
00:06:23.553 --> 00:06:25.804
start in a more exciting way, etc.

148
00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:27.737
And the bottom line here is

149
00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:29.373
the beginning of your presentation

150
00:06:29.373 --> 00:06:32.633
is more important than the middle part or the ending, right.

151
00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:33.633
And I'm going to provide you

152
00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:35.873
with more than 10 different ways to start your speech

153
00:06:35.873 --> 00:06:37.373
in this act, okay.

154
00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:41.323
And please choose whatever starting method

155
00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:43.203
you think is best for your speech and

156
00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:44.934
or your audience, right.

157
00:06:44.934 --> 00:06:48.493
And I hope you find some inspiration

158
00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:52.609
from some of the speakers that we're going to talk about

159
00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:55.479
in this current act, okay.

160
00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.141
And one quick last note,

161
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:01.379
if you start your speech and it's loud at your event,

162
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.229
or whatever venue it is you're talking at,

163
00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.089
just repeat your first line again, right,

164
00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.278
and this is exactly why blues singers

165
00:07:10.278 --> 00:07:13.119
repeat the first line in their songs, right,

166
00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.078
because they start playing at a bar or a nightclub

167
00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:16.280
and it's loud,

168
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.377
and then everyone kind of like starts,

169
00:07:17.377 --> 00:07:18.707
"Woah, is that the band somewhere?

170
00:07:18.707 --> 00:07:20.177
I guess I'll pay attention."

171
00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:22.107
And so what they do is they just, you know,

172
00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:24.839
they repeat that line, okay.

173
00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:27.127
And anyway, there's plenty of examples out there

174
00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:30.357
in real life, this is kind of cool little trivia.

175
00:07:30.357 --> 00:07:31.708
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this section.

176
00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:32.541
Thank you.
