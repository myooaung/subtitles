1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,958
If you want, you can download

2
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:04,998
the very big PowerPoint file

3
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:07,212
that we are going to discuss in this lecture.

4
00:00:07,212 --> 00:00:09,798
And it was actually the PowerPoint presentation

5
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:11,750
that I created for my TEDx speech.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,748
And it's the first lecture of act four, scene four.

7
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:18,701
Or just go to the resources section

8
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:21,058
and download the file called,

9
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:25,740
"Case one TEDx slide Chris Haroun PPTX"

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,309
PowerPoint file, I don't know what the x is for.

11
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:29,549
Okay, the caveat here is that it is

12
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,972
an enormous, enormous file.

13
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,278
You don't have to do it, okay?

14
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,248
You don't need to download the file,

15
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:35,815
but I just wanted to show you

16
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:39,398
how I practiced my TEDx presentation, okay.

17
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,440
I memorized a 15 minute,

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,032
and put this video here, speech,

19
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:49,225
and you can see the note section within PowerPoint, right,

20
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:50,075
that I use.

21
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:52,126
And you can enter your notes in here, as well.

22
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:53,905
Right, do the same thing and Keynote as well

23
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,635
and to figure out how to do that, if you want,

24
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:59,290
go to case study number six and act four, scene four

25
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,924
for an example of writing practice notes in Keynote.

26
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:02,844
Okay, let's move on.

27
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:04,492
But per this video,

28
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:07,513
you can see that I wrote all of my notes

29
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:11,051
as I had to time my transitions, as well,

30
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,722
which was a lot of fun.

31
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:14,622
It wasn't work, it was fun,

32
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:17,432
otherwise I would not have enjoyed it, okay?

33
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:20,252
Now, you can also do the exact same thing

34
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:22,894
on the iPhone or the Android version of PowerPoint

35
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,061
which is a free download, okay.

36
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:27,461
So here's the video, here.

37
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,226
And here you can see, right,

38
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:32,581
that I have my entire presentation

39
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:36,874
and the exact same one or version of the one we just saw

40
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:38,947
on the desktop version of PowerPoint, right,

41
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:41,448
so what you can do is save it on Dropbox,

42
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:42,868
iCloud, OneDrive,

43
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,498
or locally on your smartphone,

44
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:45,448
whatever works for you,

45
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:46,988
and Google Drive, as well, okay.

46
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:49,847
So I love to have one file up in the cloud,

47
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:51,598
one PowerPoint file, and then I write to it

48
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,338
from many different devices.

49
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:56,658
And so the PowerPoint presentation that I'm reading, right,

50
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,877
in this lecture, right,

51
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:03,562
all of these, I made using PowerPoint on many devices.

52
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:05,262
I didn't just do it on a Mac,

53
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:07,453
I actually did it on my Windows device, as well.

54
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:11,083
I did it on iPad, on an iPhone, etc., okay.

55
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,916
So I practiced this speech, right,

56
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:19,476
when I went on very, very long walks with my iPhone, okay,

57
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,599
and while looking at the slides, right,

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,768
that you can see in this video on my iPhone screen.

59
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,543
I kept doing this until I had it memorized.
