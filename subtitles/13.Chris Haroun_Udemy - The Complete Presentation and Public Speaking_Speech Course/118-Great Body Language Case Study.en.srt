00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,830
This is not a political course at all

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,749
but please watch this video on how

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:09,879
a certain company analyzes how Obama presented

4
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,712
in his speech in 2004.

5
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:16,908
I want you to please watch how Obama uses his hands

6
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:21,094
to present and watch how he makes eye contact

7
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,675
with as many people as he can, okay?

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:28,201
I was going to watch how he pauses.

9
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,953
And this is a great way to end analyzing body language

10
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:36,227
and overall delivery best practices.

11
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:37,060
Thank you.
