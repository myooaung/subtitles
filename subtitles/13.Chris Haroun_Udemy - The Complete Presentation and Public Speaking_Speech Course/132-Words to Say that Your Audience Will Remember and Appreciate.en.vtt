00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:02.566
In terms of words to say

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.890
that your audience will remember and appreciate

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.214
when you're answering questions,

4
00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:08.581
I want you to be real

5
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.464
and I want you to be personable in your presentation

6
00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:13.466
when you're answering questions.

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.465
So here's some words or phrases to use

8
00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.349
when answering questions, okay?

9
00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.294
And these are really fun and easy to do

10
00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:22.913
because only you know the answer, nobody else.

11
00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:25.039
Here are the examples, okay?

12
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.267
When I grew up in, put in your country name,

13
00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:32.102
my mother or father used to tell me that, okay?

14
00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:33.121
Another one is this.

15
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.454
My older sister is also a student there.

16
00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:40.859
My little brother works there as well.

17
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.014
My grandfather used to always tell me

18
00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:46.993
that I should never take a shortcut

19
00:00:46.993 --> 00:00:49.814
that I've never taken before when I'm in a hurry

20
00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:52.125
and that's why I'm seven hours late

21
00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:53.945
for today's presentation.

22
00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:54.981
I threw in the last part, sorry.

23
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.940
It's a bad joke.

24
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.598
Or you say this, in Canada, we also did the same thing

25
00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:03.374
growing up but the only difference was this.

26
00:01:03.374 --> 00:01:06.525
Okay, so why am I mentioning all of this?

27
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:10.007
Because I want you to make the Q&A experience personable

28
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:11.730
so you don't sound like a robot, okay,

29
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.793
and you want these people in the audience

30
00:01:14.793 --> 00:01:18.307
to remember you as a person with character

31
00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.561
and diversity and you're interesting.

32
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.454
So just be interesting, okay?

33
00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:26.726
And it's fascinating because with my in-class students,

34
00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:28.819
whenever I make them present,

35
00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.173
the best part of the presentation

36
00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:34.329
is when they speak naturally during the Q&A session, right?

37
00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.324
And I always get them to bring in

38
00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:39.111
personal experiences of theirs as well, right,

39
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.646
and it just, it makes 'em more real and more enjoyable.

40
00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:43.592
I mean, there's a reason why reality TV

41
00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:46.007
is so popular I guess, okay?

42
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:50.160
Separately, use the person's name when answering questions.

43
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.548
People love the sound of their name, okay,

44
00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:54.381
but more importantly,

45
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.272
I really want you to connect with that person

46
00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:58.550
and with the audience in general

47
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.045
and be humble and self-deprecating.

48
00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:02.992
Poke fun of yourself a bit.

49
00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:07.159
It's a really admirable quality and arrogance is not, okay?

50
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.567
So if somebody asked you a very complimentary question,

51
00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:16.174
you can answer it by also saying

52
00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:19.237
that your shortcomings are this

53
00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.034
or you learned how to do this

54
00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:22.960
because you fail a lot because this in the past,

55
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.904
that sort of thing, whatever.

56
00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:27.295
I always believe that you can learn a lot

57
00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:29.764
through other people's failures

58
00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:33.236
like you might work for somebody right now or in the past

59
00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.439
that should not be managing people, right?

60
00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.256
They're awful managers and you know exactly what I mean

61
00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:39.799
but you know what, you learn from them.

62
00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.365
You learn what not to do.

63
00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:42.509
Okay.

64
00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.209
And lastly, when you're answering questions

65
00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.774
and when you're presenting in general,

66
00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:50.623
please please please be upbeat, be personable

67
00:02:50.623 --> 00:02:54.373
and structure your logic in a very simple way

68
00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.487
potentially using the frameworks we spoke about

69
00:02:57.487 --> 00:02:59.609
and also be humble, thank you.
