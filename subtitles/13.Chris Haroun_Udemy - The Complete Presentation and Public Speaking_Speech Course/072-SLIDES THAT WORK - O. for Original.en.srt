1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:04,608
The last letter in PIMCO is O for Original.

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,559
Right, I try to be original with this.

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,523
I know that we mentioned the word "different"

4
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:14,661
in our content creation strategy earlier in the course

5
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:18,283
but I really, really want you to be different, okay?

6
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:19,741
I included a synonym for it,

7
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,348
O, Original, same thing as different

8
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:25,333
because I want you to think different,

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,821
kinda like Steve Jobs did, and if you think different,

10
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:32,980
then you'll really stand out and you'll give this incredibly

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,604
passionate and memorable performance.

12
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:37,241
Right? Just be different.

13
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,324
Be you. Okay?

14
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:42,339
Okay, so being original makes people remember you.

15
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,481
And conforming for presentations

16
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:47,320
doesn't really have the same effect.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,324
How boring is it if you use the same structure

18
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:52,634
that everybody else uses in your company?

19
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,303
You'll never stand out, right?

20
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:56,652
And if you wanna move your way up the corporate ladder,

21
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:57,880
there's fewer people at the top

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,302
than there are at mid-level management,

23
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:02,474
you've gotta stand out.

24
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:06,059
Or, if you want to be a very successful entrepreneur

25
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,488
you gotta be different

26
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:10,418
and the most successful entrepreneurs I've ever met

27
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:12,738
are the ones that are just really, really different

28
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:15,059
and they don't care what people think about them.

29
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:19,440
You know, I'll never forget when I saw Marc Benioff.

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,475
I worked in this building, I think it was One Market Street

31
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:25,974
in San Francisco and Marc Benioff,

32
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:28,573
the founder of Salesforce.com worked there as well,

33
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:31,671
and sometimes I'd see him walking his Labrador,

34
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:34,032
his beautiful dog, in bare feet

35
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,214
on the main floor in the building.

36
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:38,403
He just doesn't, he's just him.

37
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:40,294
He's different. He's awesome.

38
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:42,054
Kinda like Steve Jobs was different.

39
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:45,494
You think different and that's why you become successful.

40
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,043
You're just different, right?

41
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:49,923
And the same thing goes for musicians, right?

42
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,584
Madonna's different, U2 is different,

43
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:56,384
Jay Z is different, and they don't try to be somebody else.

44
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,494
And nobody is successful in music

45
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,514
because they're just like somebody else.

46
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,643
There's not somebody that's successful because,

47
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:06,101
hey, that dude's kinda like Jay Z

48
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:09,324
or that guy reminds me of Drake or Adele.

49
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:11,574
No, there's only one Adele.

50
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,638
There's only one Jay Z. There's only one you.

51
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,308
So, conforming for presentations

52
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:20,228
doesn't have the same effect, okay?

53
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:23,788
And I know that some people might not want

54
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:26,863
to stand out from others when they present,

55
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:30,692
but I humbly disagree and I think that taking

56
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:35,483
calculated risks can really help to advance your career.

57
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:37,652
And I don't think that you can achieve

58
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:40,772
all of your dreams in life without taking risks,

59
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:42,932
especially when you present.

60
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,343
Here's a great quote from Mark Zuckerberg.

61
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:49,711
He said, "The biggest risk is not taking any risk.

62
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,391
"In a world that's changing really quickly

63
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,823
"the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail

64
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:57,328
"is not taking risks."

65
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:01,343
And there's this amazing Chinese proverb which is,

66
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:04,252
"Pearls don't lie on the seashore.

67
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,692
"If you want one, you must dive for it."

68
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,473
Dive and take a risk.

69
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,641
And Deepak Chopra said this,

70
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,073
"The universe has no restrictions.

71
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:15,303
"You place restrictions on the universe

72
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:16,972
"with your expectations."

73
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,919
You know, the biggest critic you have is you, right?

74
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,428
And if people try to make you conform when you present

75
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,871
and you feel almost claustrophobic,

76
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,172
then keep this in mind from Steve Jobs, please.

77
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:31,561
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it

78
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,896
living someone else's life."

79
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:37,476
So, risk-taking and being different

80
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:41,506
is really important in the arts as well.

81
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:45,538
You know, concept albums like "Pet Sounds" by the Beach Boys

82
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:48,408
or "Sgt. Pepper's" by The Beatles

83
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:51,498
were risks at the time, right?

84
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:56,215
But because they were so different, they were successful.

85
00:03:56,215 --> 00:04:00,844
You know, many of these people on the cover of

86
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:04,716
this album by The Beatles were different, right?

87
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,295
It's a beautiful album, "Sgt. Pepper's."

88
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:08,066
Listen to it if you haven't, please.

89
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,536
And if you have, listen to it again.

90
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,715
It's prophetic, it's poetic, it's amazing.

91
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,915
It's a masterpiece of art, kinda like your presentation's

92
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:16,765
going to be and your slides will be.

93
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:19,107
I want you to be different and just take a chance

94
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,675
and be different when you present.

95
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:24,136
You know, life is too short to conform.

96
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:27,315
You know, just be unique and create an

97
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:30,267
Oscar-worthy experience when you present.

98
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:33,009
And dammit, have fun doing it, too.

99
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:33,842
Thank you.
