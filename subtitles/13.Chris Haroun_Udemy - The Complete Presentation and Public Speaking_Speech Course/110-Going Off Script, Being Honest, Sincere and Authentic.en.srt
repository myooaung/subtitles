1
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:03,177
I always enjoy a speech

2
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:05,809
when I notice the presenter goes off script,

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:08,584
even if it wasn't polished.

4
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:11,087
And I love it because it's so authentic,

5
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:13,852
it's so genuine, and it's so real.

6
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:18,063
We all know how popular reality TV is these days

7
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,480
and these great YouTube stars

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,980
that younger generations love.

9
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:27,535
They're real, and there's no acting.

10
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:30,512
And I really admire when people go off script

11
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:32,282
or they just keep it real.

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,582
And it can be something as small and innocent

13
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:37,053
as saying the word, God bless you,

14
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:40,625
a microsecond after somebody sneezes.

15
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,625
Or it can be during the presentation

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,130
when the speaker mentions something relevant

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,531
that occurred during the previous speaker's presentation.

18
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:52,881
Or something in the news,

19
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:55,878
like a sporting event or the Oscars

20
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:58,962
or something that almost everybody is aware of.

21
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:02,744
When I have my many in-class business students

22
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:05,404
at universities present a presentation

23
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:07,103
and they prepare a lot,

24
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:10,604
my favorite part when they present is the Q and A

25
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,682
because when they have their Q and A sessions,

26
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:16,638
they don't rehearse for it of course.

27
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:19,146
And they don't sound nervous.

28
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,632
They're just relaxed and natural during the Q and A session

29
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:24,048
because they go off script

30
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:27,963
and they just give a lot of examples from their own lives.

31
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,136
And so, when you go off script,

32
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:33,032
you'll be authentic and unrehearsed of course

33
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:36,615
and even more likable than you already are.

34
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,912
It's like when you're watching a live comedy in person

35
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:46,110
or on television and one of the actors laughs

36
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,743
when they shouldn't.

37
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:48,739
And you remember that

38
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:51,999
because it was so likable and authentic,

39
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,880
like when the late great Chris Farley,

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,420
God bless him, he was great,

41
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,854
but when he made David Spade

42
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:01,618
and I think it was Christina Applegate laugh

43
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,368
on live TV when he was doing that

44
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:09,701
motivational speaker, "In a van down by the river."

45
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:13,703
Anyway, there's many famous movie scenes

46
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:17,431
that were unscripted but they were so authentic.

47
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,350
And here's a couple examples.

48
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,830
In the movie Pretty Woman,

49
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,320
this scene is not scripted,

50
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,065
and the director left it in as Julia Roberts' laugh

51
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,813
is completely genuine, authentic,

52
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,121
and really right from the heart.

53
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,796
Check it out if you have time.

54
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:38,415
Another example is Ben Stiller in Zoolander

55
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,415
when he forgot his line,

56
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:42,875
and he said the word,

57
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,004
he was supposed to say the line,

58
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,837
"But why male models?"

59
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,830
And he repeated the same line again

60
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,986
because he didn't know what to say.

61
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:55,270
And sometimes the blooper reel is the best part,

62
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,032
and it's so real, it's so authentic.

63
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:01,508
And this is why people love watching blooper videos.
