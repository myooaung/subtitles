1
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:02,679
Let's talk about adding music

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,222
to your presentations.

3
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:05,192
If you have a video,

4
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:07,292
you might wanna throw some music in the background.

5
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:09,342
There's a couple websites I use.

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,017
The first one here is called PremiumBeats

7
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:14,027
and I buy a couple of tracks from here

8
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:15,982
for my promos usually.

9
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,792
It's really really high-quality stuff.

10
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:20,726
It's a bit pricey though.

11
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:24,083
Next up, we've got this great website here

12
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,321
called AudioBlocks.

13
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,793
It's about 99 bucks a year.

14
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,877
It's what I do, so it's totally worth it.

15
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:33,066
And in this course that you're watching right now,

16
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,878
I actually put in a couple of hundred

17
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:37,593
of little audio clips from here

18
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,152
and you can search for anything

19
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:41,840
that really sets a great mood.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
You can type in inspire.

21
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:48,140
Right?

22
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,888
As I mentioned before, whenever it's really high,

23
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,791
there's a lot more stuff going on

24
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,082
and whenever there's just fewer items,

25
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:57,915
really thin line,

26
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:00,041
there's not as much going on.

27
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,124
Hear that?

28
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:03,472
This is busy though.

29
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:04,728
Over here it's busy.

30
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,331
Busier here, hear?

31
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,164
Okay.

32
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,363
And I don't know how they name these things.

33
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,196
This is called Conspiring Cowards.

34
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:17,663
I guess that sounds like conspiring at the beginning. Okay.

35
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:21,830
But there's so much fun stuff you can throw in as well.

36
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:25,862
It gets quieter here.

37
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:31,427
And you could select the type of instruments you want.

38
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:33,634
Do you want sound effects or not.

39
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,967
Like laugh tracks or crickets, whatever.

40
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:39,875
And let's see what else I can search for.

41
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,125
Let's search for orchestra.

42
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,427
Okay.

43
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:50,430
And you can have short pieces, long pieces.

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,444
So this is just a little orchestra one.

45
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:54,527
Hear cymbals?

46
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:00,769
And this is an entire guitar piece orchestra.

47
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:07,181
Synthesizer I guess.

48
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:09,080
First snow orchestra.

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,089
(synthesized orchestra music)

50
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,639
Anyway it's a lot of fun.

51
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,086
I absolutely love it and you can select ambiance

52
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:22,191
or the type of background music you wanna have as well.

53
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,802
Right here. See? Dramatic or whatever it is.

54
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,635
Okay.

55
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,112
You can choose the mood.

56
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,317
Let's say we want something epic and inspiring,

57
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,121
which I love.

58
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,735
And then let's say the instruments,

59
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:39,868
we only want to have piano, which I love.

60
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,747
Like the movie, Up. Great piece.

61
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,497
Let's see what it is.

62
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:48,380
That sounds more than piano to me.

63
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,577
Maybe it doesn't have piano.

64
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,440
Really relaxing, eh?

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,848
Anyway, just play around with it if you want.

66
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:03,515
And then you can download it into MP3 format

67
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08,527
and then what you do is you import directly into PowerPoint

68
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:10,836
or whatever program it is you're using. Right?

69
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:15,003
So let me just import here into PowerPoint quickly.

70
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,174
So you go to insert

71
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,733
and then it's audio

72
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,125
and you can record if you want,

73
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,866
but I get it from file and it goes

74
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,399
right to my download folder usually. Right?

75
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:32,026
So we go downloads. That's the one we just downloaded there.

76
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,526
Here it is here. Check it out.

77
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,037
You can make it lower volume, Right?

78
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:41,587
Isn't that nice? Really really cool.

79
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:44,116
Right? And you can format when it starts playing.

80
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:47,534
You could say play automatically or when clicked.

81
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:49,012
And it doesn't have to be in your slides.

82
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:49,845
You put it over here.

83
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,162
It doesn't even show up usually anyway,

84
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:54,705
but put it here just in case. Okay?

85
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,989
And then, let's see what else I got here for ya.

86
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,239
So I wanna show you GarageBand as well.

87
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,800
Sorry I've got a million apps open.

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,694
So this ships free with a lot of Macs. Right?

89
00:04:08,694 --> 00:04:12,233
And people don't really use it that much,

90
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,262
but it's really fun to use to make scores. Right?

91
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:18,476
And you can even learn how to play instruments.

92
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,973
And you can download how to learn

93
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:22,486
or how to play instruments.

94
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:23,914
There are people like Sting will

95
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,577
teach you how to play guitar.

96
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:29,463
It's really cool. Check this out, man.

97
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:31,675
Sorry, a little off topic, but it's fine.

98
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:34,857
He teaches you how to play the song, Roxanne.

99
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,197
â™« Roxanne put on the red light

100
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:42,585
And within iMovie you can also put in your own audio.

101
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:43,853
Isn't that nice?

102
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:44,686
Beautiful.

103
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,161
Love it.

104
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,512
This, promos I've used in the past.

105
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:53,948
I bought this one from PremiumBeat.

106
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:56,622
I love this piece. Right?

107
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:59,852
But my favorite source is definitely AudioBlocks.

108
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:02,297
Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
