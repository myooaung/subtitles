1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:02,271
Oh, you're back.

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:03,779
Sorry, hi.

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,664
Joking, obviously.

4
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:07,952
(chuckling)

5
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:10,137
Try to make eye contact with everybody

6
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,377
if you can, at least one time.

7
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:14,400
If it's a massive crowd, obviously you can't do it,

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,236
but divide your eye contact equally amongst

9
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:19,977
the entire audience, if you can

10
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:23,460
and try not to look at one particular person too much,

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,543
if it's a large audience.

12
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:31,248
I read this great book by Larry King on speaking

13
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,227
more than 20 years ago.

14
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:35,125
I think it was back in 1994 or something,

15
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,125
maybe it was a little earlier than that, right?

16
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,685
And Larry King said that if you make eye contact

17
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:43,083
with somebody and if it's a one on one meeting,

18
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,680
look away every now and then,

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,963
just to be polite and now intimidating at all.

20
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:49,584
And it's kind of like,

21
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,125
this is out there, but I'm going there,

22
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,565
if you walk by a dog,

23
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,504
you never stare the dog in the eye because

24
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:58,197
you're challenging the dog, right it's like.

25
00:00:58,197 --> 00:01:00,016
♫ Who let the dogs out

26
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:02,104
♫ Who let the dogs out

27
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,854
It's a no no, okay.

28
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:06,128
I'm a little bit too animated in this session,

29
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:07,131
I know, sorry.

30
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:08,849
Anyway, so in general,

31
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,168
when you make eye contact with your audience,

32
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,668
they feel more engaged, right?

33
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:18,936
And part of the whole presentation experience

34
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:21,051
gets improved, and your presentation

35
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,223
kind of goes from 2-D to 3-D.

36
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:26,829
It's more animated and it's just whatever.

37
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,123
When you look around, you can tell if

38
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,614
the smartphones are winning or not,

39
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,592
and when you make a lot of eye contact, I find

40
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,043
people don't,

41
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,568
they don't use their iPhones as much,

42
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,662
maybe they're trying to be polite,

43
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,307
or maybe they're more engaged, I don't know,

44
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,307
it is what it is, right?

45
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:45,158
Anyway, don't look above the audience either,

46
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:47,890
as it shows superiority, which is

47
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,223
not what you want to convey.

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,532
I'm just kidding, okay.

49
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,032
Anyway, that's it.
