1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,720
Sometimes the best speeches you watch are the ones

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,629
where you are getting educated on a topic,

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,808
but it doesn't feel like it because the experience

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:13,040
and the content is entertaining.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,419
And we call this edutainment.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,808
It's actually learning by accident.

7
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:22,419
If it's a personal speech educating the audience

8
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:25,048
on the background of the people you are speaking about

9
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:27,648
is often used with humor.

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,189
For example, a wedding speech, which we'll cover

11
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,581
in a lot of detail in Act 11 of this course.

12
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:37,130
We're also going to cover edutainment concepts

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,640
in more detail when we talk about the delivery portion

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,152
of your speech in Act #6.

15
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:47,171
Using short animations in your presentation is a great way

16
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,171
to edutain the audience.

17
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,157
For example, using a program called PowToons,

18
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:56,286
Which I'll explain how to use in Act 4,

19
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:58,087
when we cover different software applications

20
00:00:58,087 --> 00:00:59,527
to make your speeches,

21
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:03,155
you can make a really complex topic entertaining

22
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:06,367
and educational at the same time.

23
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,605
Super Bowl commercials are so successful

24
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,037
because we don't realize that we're being educated

25
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:15,175
about a product by watching these commercials.

26
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,876
This is the experience I really want you to provide

27
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:20,455
when we are presenting, okay?

28
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,695
And if you aren't sure what to include that is educational,

29
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:27,567
then please revisit journal exercise number three

30
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:31,066
which covers the purpose of your presentation.

31
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,927
Deliver that purpose and make it entertaining

32
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,447
and educational at the same time.

33
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:40,614
Lastly, here's the example of a time when I used PowToons

34
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:46,182
to create an education, or I should say edutaining excerpt

35
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:49,367
in one of my courses.

36
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:52,226
There are many different financial analyst roles,

37
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:54,935
from investment banking, to hedge funds,

38
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,847
to venture capital, to private equity,

39
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,607
to trading, to sales, etc.

40
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,085
There's many of them, and in this course,

41
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:06,095
per the images below, I'm going to go through

42
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:09,178
14 different financial analyst roles.

43
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,445
What we're going to do in this portion is,

44
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:17,612
I'm actually going to go over just the top seven of the 14.

45
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:23,237
We'll build on this logic very slowly, so you understand

46
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:26,277
what some of the basic daily tasks are

47
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,567
for these seven analysts you see in front of you.

48
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,133
And, I think you'll enjoy this session.

49
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,247
Again, we're going to build on this slowly.

50
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:36,226
So let me just kick it off with a quick animation

51
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:38,277
on what these roles are.

52
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:40,944
(upbeat music)
