00:00:01.059 --> 00:00:03.405
In the first intermission, you recorded yourself.

2
00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.069
At that point in the course,

3
00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.783
we'd only discussed act one, which is who is the audience,

4
00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:13.197
act two, which is the purpose of your speech,

5
00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:16.095
and act three, creating the content.

6
00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:17.229
Since that first intermission,

7
00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:20.662
we've discussed act four, which is creating your slides,

8
00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:24.330
act five, which deals with confidence,

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.497
and act six, which discusses delivery.

10
00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:31.864
Okay, so please record yourself

11
00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.889
with your smartphone or your tablet or your laptop

12
00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:37.773
or your desktop or a video camera, et cetera,

13
00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:42.125
and please present any presentation that you want to,

14
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.071
along with the slides that you have or will create.

15
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:48.095
Why are we doing this?

16
00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:50.787
Because I want you to notice the dramatic improvement

17
00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:53.795
in your presentation skills by the end of this course.

18
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.397
And so for this exercise, please present

19
00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:59.469
based on the content that you have created

20
00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.221
so far in your success journal,

21
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.221
or any speech you gave or will give.

22
00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:08.003
Wait wait, whoa, whoa, whoa,

23
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:09.368
please don't skip the rest of this lecture.

24
00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.395
Stay with me here, please, hear me out, okay?

25
00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.275
If you can't video yourself with the slides,

26
00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:17.453
then just say the slides as intermission number two slides,

27
00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:21.272
okay, and if you've not completed all or any

28
00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:23.320
of the exercises in your success journal,

29
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.669
then just give a presentation based on a real presentation

30
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:30.765
that you have given at some point in your life,

31
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:35.352
or better yet, present on this topic, you 2.0,

32
00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:38.979
what your perfect life will be like in 2025

33
00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.411
and making it happen, okay?

34
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:44.911
Now, after you finish recording this video

35
00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:49.560
and making the slides to the best of your abilities,

36
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.229
then save it and put it aside please,

37
00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.234
as we will analyze your slides

38
00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:57.897
and your speech in the next lecture.

39
00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:01.080
And don't worry if you're not that prepared, okay?

40
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.893
Just, I want you just to record it

41
00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.965
and make it as long or as short as you want

42
00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:09.083
with many or few slides, your call.

43
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:12.216
And I really want you to have fun with this as well, right,

44
00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.328
'cause we get to create it, it's fun.

45
00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.415
Okay, and after you record your presentation

46
00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:20.131
and make the slides, then please come back to me,

47
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.008
right, for the next lecture.

48
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:22.841
Thanks.
