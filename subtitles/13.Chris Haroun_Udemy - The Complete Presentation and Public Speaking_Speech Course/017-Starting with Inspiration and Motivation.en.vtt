00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.246
Everybody loves inspiration.

2
00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.768
Who doesn't want to feel inspired?

3
00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:09.680
Everybody wants to realize their full potential in life.

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.200
There are so many incredible ways to start speeches

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.680
by being inspirational.

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.429
After this lecture, I will share with you

7
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.762
150 of my favorite inspirational quotes,

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.199
but I want you to please analyze or watch speeches

9
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.108
in this lecture including the YouTube links, okay?

10
00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:34.640
Now, watch them and please look for inspiration

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.349
and while you watch them,

12
00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:39.727
think about how you can inspire others

13
00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.488
at the beginning of your speeches.

14
00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:44.888
So let's talk about five examples.

15
00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:47.309
In terms of the first inspirational way

16
00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.720
to start a speech example,

17
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.109
I get shiverish just thinking of this one,

18
00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.949
here is a tremendous way to start a speech

19
00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.368
with inspiration especially if the odds are against you

20
00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:02.787
and your colleagues.

21
00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:06.954
This speech is a real story of how a group of athletes

22
00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:11.837
defied the odds at the peak of the Cold War.

23
00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:15.420
Please watch how the speaker speaks slowly,

24
00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:18.756
clearly and pauses a lot

25
00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.149
after saying very motivational things

26
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.379
and we'll work on pauses and how to speak

27
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.458
and how to move your hands and whatnot

28
00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:32.320
during the body portion of this course, okay.

29
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.070
Now, this person speaks from the heart, okay,

30
00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:40.766
and I think I'm gonna get my kids to watch this movie.

31
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:45.720
My favorite part of this speech is when this coach says,

32
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.688
"This is your time.

33
00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:49.256
"Their time is done.

34
00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.259
"It's over."

35
00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.342
Check it out.

36
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.468
Now, I want you to think of your dreams, okay.

37
00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:01.801
In this example,

38
00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:07.128
the speaker jumps right into it and inspires people.

39
00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:08.819
This is really, really powerful

40
00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.808
and it works exceptionally well

41
00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:14.800
if you wanna inspire and empower your colleagues, okay.

42
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.829
This guy is named Les Brown

43
00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.139
and he gives an impeccable performance

44
00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.306
of not only inspiring the audience but also being personal

45
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:29.676
and talking about perceived personal shortcomings, okay.

46
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.979
This video, it blows my mind.

47
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.989
My favorite quote in this one is,

48
00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.499
"Someone's opinion of you

49
00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.558
"does not have to become your reality."

50
00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:43.641
Check it out.

51
00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:50.819
Okay, in terms of example number three,

52
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.189
this is a rally the troops speech.

53
00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.719
The best part is when the coach says,

54
00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.299
"No one comes into our house and pushes us around."

55
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.132
I love it.

56
00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:02.200
I love it, okay.

57
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.549
This is a compilation of mind blowing motivational ways

58
00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.509
to start a speech,

59
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:11.118
to rally a team of athletes or business people

60
00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:13.400
or anyone really or just to give you a pick me up

61
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.269
if you ever feel down and out in your life, okay.

62
00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.848
So check this video out.

63
00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:20.028
I think you'll find a couple of really cool quotes

64
00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:23.497
to maybe not even use in your speeches,

65
00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:26.983
but to make you feel more inspired, okay.

66
00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:28.066
Check it out.

67
00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:34.404
All right, let's talk about the fourth example.

68
00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:36.661
If you're presenting to people

69
00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:39.712
and you're in a crisis at your company, right,

70
00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:44.143
and you need to survive through one last battle,

71
00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:48.783
then please watch this empowering speech from Al Pacino

72
00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:53.663
in Any Given Sunday on motivating a football team.

73
00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:55.712
Not only is he very inspiring,

74
00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:59.879
but he is extraordinarily personal, transparent, and real.

75
00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.258
Check it out.

76
00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:09.973
Okay, the fifth inspirational way to start a speech

77
00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:14.393
is another amalgamation of great inspiring speeches

78
00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:17.354
including one from Will Smith, I love that guy,

79
00:04:17.354 --> 00:04:18.903
in the Pursuit of Happiness

80
00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:22.404
where he's actually speaking to his real son in life, okay.

81
00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:26.775
He says, "You got a dream, you gotta protect."

82
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.358
When people can't do something,

83
00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:33.594
they tell you you can't do it, okay?

84
00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:36.103
You want something, you gotta go get it period.

85
00:04:36.103 --> 00:04:37.015
Very powerful.

86
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:40.813
So here's the final amalgamation of miscellaneous

87
00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:45.293
powerful and inspirational one-liners to start a speech with

88
00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:48.960
that you can consider using for inspiration.
