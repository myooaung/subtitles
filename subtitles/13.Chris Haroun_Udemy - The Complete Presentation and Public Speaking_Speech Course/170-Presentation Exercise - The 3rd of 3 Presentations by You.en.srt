1
00:00:00,861 --> 00:00:02,990
In the first and second intermissions,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,605
you record yourself.

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,226
At that point in the course,

4
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:09,097
we'd only discussed act one, which is the audience,

5
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:11,796
act two, which is the purpose of your speech,

6
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:14,982
and act three, which is creating the content.

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,249
And since our second intermission,

8
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,415
you might have looked at some of the optional templates

9
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,847
to using act number 11.

10
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:24,711
So I want you to please record yourself

11
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:26,634
with your smartphone or your tablet

12
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:27,805
or your laptop or your desktop

13
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,375
or a video camera, whatever.

14
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,596
And make sure that your slides are even better

15
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:35,965
than they were in your second intermission

16
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:37,394
presentation, right?

17
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:38,904
And the same thing goes with your delivery

18
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,669
and your content, etc.

19
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:41,796
I want you to do this

20
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:43,445
and to please be serious about it.

21
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,545
And this time, I want you to have a dress rehearsal.

22
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:50,216
So please wear exactly what you're going to wear

23
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,923
right when you present, exactly, okay?

24
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:54,987
And for this exercise,

25
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,542
please present based on the content

26
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:00,242
that you've created in your success journal

27
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:03,045
and review every single success journal exercise

28
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:04,951
that you've completed, please.

29
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,644
And if you need help with any of the topics

30
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,210
then please go back and review the lectures

31
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,620
associated with that particular topic.

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,080
And after you've finished recording this video

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,072
and making the slides to the best of your abilities,

34
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:22,695
then save it and put it aside,

35
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:26,061
as we will analyze your slides and your speech

36
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:27,376
in the next lecture.

37
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:28,209
Thank you,

38
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,901
and have a lot of fun with this.

39
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:32,979
And after you record your presentation

40
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,439
and perfect your slides,

41
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,771
please come back to me in the next lecture.

42
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:37,604
Thanks, again.
