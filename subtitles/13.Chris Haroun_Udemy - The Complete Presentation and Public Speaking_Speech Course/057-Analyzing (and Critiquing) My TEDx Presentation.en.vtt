00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:04.499
I gave a TEDx talk at San Francisco State University.

2
00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:08.097
Let's watch it and please notice the pop ups

3
00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:10.280
that will be used to critique the content

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.618
delivery and slides.

5
00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:15.269
And I know that we have not yet covered the delivery

6
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.720
and slide creation lectures yet,

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.259
but I want to introduce you to some of the

8
00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.539
topics we're gonna cover in acts four and six.

9
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.920
Just to put on your radar screen as we discuss

10
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.587
and critique this video, thanks.

11
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.469
(applause)

12
00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:44.896
Better to be deprived of food for three days

13
00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:46.539
than tea for one.

14
00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:47.872
Chinese proverb.

15
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:51.685
Come and share a pot of tea.

16
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.419
My home is warm and my friendship's free.

17
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:55.502
Emily Barnes.

18
00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:59.714
Make tea not war, Monty Python.

19
00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.469
Everybody loves tea.

20
00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.478
When I was younger and I wasn't feeling well,

21
00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:08.589
my mother would give me tea

22
00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:11.160
and I'd feel much better.

23
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.840
For hundreds of years, tea was for medicinal

24
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.669
purposes only.

25
00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:16.051
And then the British discovered it

26
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.699
and they realized that having tea is like

27
00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:21.131
having a picnic indoors.

28
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.080
And I believe it was Sting who said,

29
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.291
I don't take coffee, I take tea my dear.

30
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.600
Tea is the quintessential olive branch.

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.400
And tea was actually introduced in Russia

32
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.629
by the Chinese government as a gift to

33
00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:36.712
Tsar Alexis in the 1600s.

34
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.091
Tea knows no borders, tea is loved universally.

35
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.787
Now, tea in America became popular in the 1800s.

36
00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:48.787
And green tea was very popular here.

37
00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:52.675
And then by World War Two you couldn't get tea in America.

38
00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:57.453
And so America started importing tea from India, black tea.

39
00:01:57.453 --> 00:01:59.928
And since then black tea is the most popular

40
00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:01.345
tea in the world.

41
00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.187
Tea can change everything for us.

42
00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:08.107
Tea can solve all of our problems.

43
00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:09.738
T.E.A.

44
00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:12.905
Technology, education, and acceptance.

45
00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.538
Without all three of the aforementioned

46
00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:23.343
pillars in place, we can't move forward as a society.

47
00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.471
Without technology, education and acceptance are

48
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:28.031
wasted resources.

49
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:30.761
Without education, technology and acceptance

50
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.191
are wasted resources.

51
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:37.319
And without acceptance, we move back to the dark ages.

52
00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.743
So, as we look to design our futures,

53
00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.371
if we need to move forward, we need to embrace

54
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.454
all three of these items.

55
00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:48.570
And I'm incredibly excited about the future.

56
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.241
If we embrace tea, again, we will solve all problems.

57
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:56.161
Now, at the root of this secular growth shift,

58
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:58.801
is the primary catalyst of cloud computing.

59
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.559
And I'll explain what I mean by this.

60
00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.689
In 2005, Amazon created something called Amazon

61
00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.239
web services which is the most important

62
00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.153
technology platform the world has ever seen.

63
00:03:11.153 --> 00:03:13.217
And Jeff Bezos cut the pricing point of Amazon

64
00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:17.468
web services more than 50 times since 2005.

65
00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:19.617
Now, if we compare and contrast this with

66
00:03:19.617 --> 00:03:21.576
Microsoft Windows, Microsoft only cut

67
00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.049
the pricing point of Windows three times going back

68
00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.132
to the 1980s.

69
00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.457
And so, what's happened is a lot of companies have been

70
00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:31.449
running all of their technology processes

71
00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.066
off of Amazon web services.

72
00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.757
And these companies wouldn't exist today

73
00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.449
if it wasn't for it.

74
00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.819
What does this mean for education?

75
00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.839
Well, these technology companies would not exist today,

76
00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.068
they wouldn't be profitable.

77
00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:46.159
These charities wouldn't even exist if

78
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.948
it weren't for cloud computing or

79
00:03:47.948 --> 00:03:50.781
services like Amazon web services.

80
00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:55.148
And so I believe that capitalism

81
00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:57.815
and deflation can fix education.

82
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.988
Now, let's go back the the 1980s.

83
00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:04.916
Everybody loves the '80s right?

84
00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:08.137
And probably the most important event of the 1980s

85
00:04:08.137 --> 00:04:10.716
was the fall of the Berlin wall.

86
00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:12.265
A barrier came down.

87
00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:15.777
And one of my fondest memories of the 1980s

88
00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:18.097
was when the late, great Ronald Reagan gave

89
00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:20.607
the most empowering speech.

90
00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:22.548
And he went off script and he said a couple of words

91
00:04:22.548 --> 00:04:24.857
that changed the world.

92
00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:28.524
He said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

93
00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.802
And the wall came down.

94
00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:36.785
And it was Alan Greenspan at the time that said

95
00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.113
the reason we had such incredible, prosperous

96
00:04:38.113 --> 00:04:41.964
economic growth in the 1990s, without inflation,

97
00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:43.495
and with low interest rates, was because

98
00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.073
this barrier came down.

99
00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:48.324
And when the great wall fell, pardon me, sorry,

100
00:04:48.324 --> 00:04:52.313
the Berlin wall fell, what happened was,

101
00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:54.583
you had a lot of very intelligent, and well educated

102
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:58.083
Eastern European labor moving west, right.

103
00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:02.281
And that kept inflation in check.

104
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:06.582
There are significant issues when we build walls.

105
00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:09.663
In 1948, in Berlin, allied nations had to fly

106
00:05:09.663 --> 00:05:12.663
literally 200,000 planes over Berlin

107
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:18.073
and drop basic necessities, food and water.

108
00:05:18.073 --> 00:05:20.103
Well, I believe that another basic necessity

109
00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:23.604
is the right to education, as well.

110
00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:26.746
And I'm worried that as more people get access to online

111
00:05:26.746 --> 00:05:29.829
education, more firewalls will built,

112
00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:32.876
we're building more walls.

113
00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:34.116
There's a solution to this,

114
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:36.076
I'll talk about it in a couple minutes.

115
00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:38.705
Okay, I've taken you to the '80s,

116
00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:42.872
let's now go to the '90s which was another great decade.

117
00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:46.839
And because the Berlin wall fell in 1989,

118
00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.339
the top earners in the 1990s were traders,

119
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.260
bond traders and equity traders.

120
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.521
And I think that teachers are gonna be the bond

121
00:05:57.521 --> 00:05:59.354
traders of the future.

122
00:06:01.618 --> 00:06:03.210
I think that teaching is the most scalable

123
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.419
business model there is out there.

124
00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.380
Think about it.

125
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.839
If you're a doctor, or god forbid a lawyer,

126
00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.668
you can treat one patient at a time.

127
00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:15.929
If you're a teacher, you can teach students in over

128
00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:18.831
190 countries at the same time.

129
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:19.998
It's scalable.

130
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.321
And so, a lot of people want to teach.

131
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.991
A lot of government officials, business executives.

132
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:30.980
But quite often they say, I'll teach later in my career.

133
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.580
And what they're not saying is, they can't make

134
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.529
enough money doing it.

135
00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.151
And I love teachers, because teachers are very passionate

136
00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:37.629
about what they do.

137
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:38.831
They don't do it for the money.

138
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.729
That's a beautiful thing.

139
00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.169
But now, everybody can teach, right.

140
00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.679
You've got the economic incentive in place.

141
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.332
And so in the future, there's going to be many,

142
00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:50.892
many more people with practical skills

143
00:06:50.892 --> 00:06:53.370
that will be teaching.

144
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.143
And so there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow

145
00:06:56.143 --> 00:07:00.063
and it's about time teachers get compensated.

146
00:07:00.063 --> 00:07:02.732
And so, I'm very excited to be a part of this movement.

147
00:07:02.732 --> 00:07:05.361
So, get ready for the multi decade ed-tech secular

148
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.944
growth opportunity.

149
00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:10.841
Now, I've talked a bunch about the teacher,

150
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.073
I want to talk about the student now.

151
00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:15.244
What a great time to be a student.

152
00:07:15.244 --> 00:07:17.753
You got access to all this incredible stuff online

153
00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:19.336
at very low prices.

154
00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:23.343
And the amazing thing now about being a student

155
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:25.693
or a child, in the middle of almost every continent,

156
00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:30.124
is you've got more power in your cell phone,

157
00:07:30.124 --> 00:07:32.385
you've got more access to information,

158
00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:35.084
and faster access to information than Bill Clinton did

159
00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:36.167
in the 1990s.

160
00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:41.055
And one of these cell phones or smart phones today

161
00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:43.495
has more processing power than every single computer

162
00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:45.865
in the world in 1969 that was used to

163
00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.543
put the first person on the moon.

164
00:07:47.543 --> 00:07:50.231
And there's two billion of these things.

165
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:53.484
How could you not be excited about this?

166
00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:57.084
And so, the platform that we'll use for students

167
00:07:57.084 --> 00:08:01.335
going forward in the future, is of course, mobile.

168
00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.495
And the future is now.

169
00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:04.328
It's time.

170
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:09.193
It's time for the democratization of education.

171
00:08:10.964 --> 00:08:13.255
A cup of tea is a cup of peace.

172
00:08:13.255 --> 00:08:14.338
Soshitsu Sen.

173
00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:17.353
Every single problem in the world can

174
00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:19.113
be solved with Ed-tech.

175
00:08:19.113 --> 00:08:21.564
Every single problem without exception.

176
00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:24.673
And I want to urge our politicians in Washington,

177
00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:26.815
and everywhere in the world,

178
00:08:26.815 --> 00:08:30.170
to wake up and realize, respectfully,

179
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.884
that if we're going to progress as a society,

180
00:08:32.884 --> 00:08:36.524
we need to understand that education fixes all problems.

181
00:08:36.524 --> 00:08:39.943
And the problem with Washington and Wall Street,

182
00:08:39.943 --> 00:08:42.172
and business in general, is everybody

183
00:08:42.172 --> 00:08:44.332
is so short term focused.

184
00:08:44.332 --> 00:08:45.852
And because everyone's so short term focused,

185
00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:48.932
I'm afraid we might move back to the dark ages.

186
00:08:48.932 --> 00:08:51.971
If we were long term focused,

187
00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:54.591
and we looked at education as solution to all problems,

188
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:57.174
we as a society would progress.

189
00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:00.109
And so, I've taken you to the '90s,

190
00:09:00.109 --> 00:09:01.791
I've taken you to the '80s.

191
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.061
We're gonna skip the '70s cause the '70s was a drag.

192
00:09:04.061 --> 00:09:07.061
And we're gonna go back to the '60s.

193
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.690
And I love JFK.

194
00:09:11.362 --> 00:09:14.983
I mean, this guy was so long term focused,

195
00:09:14.983 --> 00:09:18.053
his administration created the Peace Corps

196
00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:20.154
and the Peace Corps did a lot of wonderful

197
00:09:20.154 --> 00:09:22.434
things all over the world.

198
00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.892
He was very long term focused.

199
00:09:24.892 --> 00:09:29.125
And so peacecorps.org has done a lot of good.

200
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:31.404
And I challenge our politicians to create

201
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:35.571
a commensurate platform called globaledtechcorps.org.

202
00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:40.975
And I just checked and that website is available

203
00:09:40.975 --> 00:09:43.725
in case they want to register it.

204
00:09:46.757 --> 00:09:49.586
If this is coffee, please bring me some tea;

205
00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:52.933
but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.

206
00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:54.266
Abraham Lincoln.

207
00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:57.533
Wouldn't it be dreadful to live in a country

208
00:09:57.533 --> 00:10:00.186
where they don't have tea?

209
00:10:00.186 --> 00:10:02.269
Professor Herb Meiberger.

210
00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:07.835
One child, one teacher, one book,

211
00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:10.252
one pen can change the world.

212
00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:15.437
This was said by my hero, a young Pakistani woman,

213
00:10:15.437 --> 00:10:19.064
who changed the world through one brave act.

214
00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:21.157
She also had this to say,

215
00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:24.255
let us pick up our books and our pens,

216
00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:26.695
they are the most powerful weapons.

217
00:10:26.695 --> 00:10:28.954
And then something tragic occurred,

218
00:10:28.954 --> 00:10:30.621
on October 9th 2012.

219
00:10:32.284 --> 00:10:36.367
Malala was shot, she was shot for demanding equal

220
00:10:37.632 --> 00:10:40.283
rights to education for women.

221
00:10:40.283 --> 00:10:42.525
She stood up for human rights.

222
00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:44.175
God bless her.

223
00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:48.365
And I think this day October 9, 2012 should be made

224
00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:49.634
a global holiday.

225
00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:52.005
Every year in every country so we can

226
00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:55.538
observe the importance of education in improving society.

227
00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:59.455
Now, what Malala did was she embraced education

228
00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.570
and she embraced acceptance.

229
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.769
Imagine what we can do if she embraces technology,

230
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:09.010
as well, and adds it to her repertoire.

231
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.177
What would result is peace and love in every country,

232
00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:18.269
in every city, in every house in the world.

233
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:21.250
It takes one person to stand up and change the world.

234
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.978
One person, I don't believe in sending troops

235
00:11:23.978 --> 00:11:27.450
overseas to fight wars we can't win or understand.

236
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.770
I believe society can change from within.

237
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.268
And Malala is one person.

238
00:11:33.268 --> 00:11:34.558
I think we're gonna get to a point where there's

239
00:11:34.558 --> 00:11:38.109
thousands and millions of Malala's rising up,

240
00:11:38.109 --> 00:11:40.749
using YouTube and using technology to change

241
00:11:40.749 --> 00:11:42.981
the world from within.

242
00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:45.839
This can happen if we allow it to.

243
00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:49.089
And so, we all have the right to water.

244
00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:53.259
We all have the right to air.

245
00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:56.789
We all have the beautiful right of freedom of religion.

246
00:11:56.789 --> 00:11:59.420
We can coexist together.

247
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.442
But there's one more thing I think that's just as important

248
00:12:02.442 --> 00:12:05.130
as these three aforementioned fundamental rights.

249
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.802
And that's the right of unfiltered education

250
00:12:08.802 --> 00:12:11.501
for everybody globally.

251
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:12.770
Thank God for tea!

252
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.639
What would the world do without tea?

253
00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:17.328
How did it exist?

254
00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:19.559
I am glad I was not born before tea.

255
00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:21.392
Reverend Sydney Smith.

256
00:12:22.517 --> 00:12:25.069
Come, let us have some tea and continue

257
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:27.468
to talk about happy things.

258
00:12:27.468 --> 00:12:28.468
Rabbi Potok.

259
00:12:30.469 --> 00:12:33.170
I want to talk about T.E.A. in government.

260
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.821
I want to talk about T.E.A. in humanitarian efforts.

261
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:40.370
I want to talk about T.E.A. in Facebook.

262
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.008
A lot of people don't realize that Mark Zuckerberg

263
00:12:42.008 --> 00:12:46.269
had a big part to play with the Arab Spring.

264
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:48.749
My heroes that started the Arab Spring include

265
00:12:48.749 --> 00:12:52.709
Walid and Jawad Nabulsi who's a good friend, as well.

266
00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:55.829
And what happened was, Walid and Jawad and their

267
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:59.996
friends they created a Facebook group, pro human rights.

268
00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.218
And at that time you were only allowed to have 5,000

269
00:13:03.218 --> 00:13:05.718
people in each Facebook group.

270
00:13:06.707 --> 00:13:08.450
And then Mark Zuckerberg found out about this,

271
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.149
and God bless him, he lifted the cap.

272
00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:13.078
He lifted the cap and all of a sudden you had

273
00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:17.245
hundreds of thousands of people marching in Cairo.

274
00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:20.269
He did his part in helping to change the world

275
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:24.170
by embracing technology, education, and acceptance.

276
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:28.776
And I very humbly challenge our space pioneers,

277
00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:32.693
Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Sir Richard Branson.

278
00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:37.372
With great power comes great responsibility.

279
00:13:37.372 --> 00:13:39.971
I challenge them to make education available to

280
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:42.754
everybody on the planet using technology.

281
00:13:42.754 --> 00:13:43.951
It's not much of a stretch.

282
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:47.119
If you think about it, 1948, in one year,

283
00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:50.573
we sent 200,000 flights over Berlin to drop

284
00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:53.962
basic necessities, food and water.

285
00:13:53.962 --> 00:13:56.281
Well, the right to unfiltered education is a basic

286
00:13:56.281 --> 00:13:58.213
necessity, as well.

287
00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:00.791
So, how can we achieve this?

288
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:02.151
Well, we already have the technology in place,

289
00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:03.583
or we will very soon.

290
00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:07.221
It might be a rendition of 6G, 7G, 8G, 9G,

291
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.533
whatever it might be.

292
00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:10.731
But we need to come together and make this happen

293
00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:13.751
as we're all in this together.

294
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:17.623
And so education is a right, education is freedom.

295
00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.391
And the late, great Nelson Mandela said that

296
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:23.162
education is the most important weapon we can use

297
00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.063
to change the world.

298
00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.710
And I believe it.

299
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.662
Computer!

300
00:14:27.662 --> 00:14:28.653
Tea.

301
00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:29.486
Earl Grey.

302
00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:30.411
Hot.

303
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.120
And whoever this Earl Grey fellow is,

304
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.143
I'd like to have a word with him.

305
00:14:34.143 --> 00:14:36.143
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

306
00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:40.743
On Christmas day at half past three,

307
00:14:40.743 --> 00:14:42.733
brew yourself a cup of tea.

308
00:14:42.733 --> 00:14:43.903
I'll think if you.

309
00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:45.253
You think of me.

310
00:14:45.253 --> 00:14:48.311
While sitting round the Christmas tree.

311
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:49.811
Hallmark, I think.

312
00:14:53.082 --> 00:14:55.033
And so, you may say I'm a dreamer.,

313
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:57.434
but I'm not the only one.

314
00:14:57.434 --> 00:14:58.834
I hope some day you'll join us,

315
00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:00.684
and the world will be as one.

316
00:15:00.684 --> 00:15:02.874
John Lennon, of course.

317
00:15:02.874 --> 00:15:05.333
Technology, education, and acceptance,

318
00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:08.485
T.E.A. tea, can and will change the world

319
00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:11.068
if we all choose to embrace it.

320
00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.493
I hope next time when we meet,

321
00:15:14.493 --> 00:15:16.962
we won't be fighting each other.

322
00:15:16.962 --> 00:15:19.461
Instead we will be drinking tea together.

323
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:20.461
Jackie Chan.

324
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.021
Water is the mother of tea,

325
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:25.773
a teapot its father,

326
00:15:25.773 --> 00:15:28.140
and fire the teacher.

327
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.473
Chinese proverb.

328
00:15:30.623 --> 00:15:33.922
So, I wrote this speech when I was in Ireland.

329
00:15:33.922 --> 00:15:36.442
And I was so inspired by the landscape

330
00:15:36.442 --> 00:15:39.739
and so I want to finish it with this.

331
00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:43.090
May you always have walls for the winds,

332
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.210
a roof for the rain,

333
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.541
tea beside the fire,

334
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:49.618
laughter to cheer you,

335
00:15:49.618 --> 00:15:51.330
those you love near you,

336
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.580
and all your heart might desire.

337
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.301
An Irish blessing.

338
00:15:55.301 --> 00:15:56.419
Thank you.

339
00:15:56.419 --> 00:15:58.669
(applause)
