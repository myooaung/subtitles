00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:03.724
C is for consistency.

2
00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:06.435
If you use a certain theme in your slides,

3
00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:10.722
make sure to stay true to that consistent theme.

4
00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.108
Kinda like how your belt is suppose

5
00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:15.347
to match your shoes.

6
00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:17.260
And we'll talk about dressing

7
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.564
and what to wear at presentations

8
00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:21.058
later on in Act number 9.

9
00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:22.906
But please try to be consistent

10
00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:24.615
if it makes sense to do so,

11
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.397
you know with your fonts, with the colors you use,

12
00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:30.122
with story telling themes, etc.

13
00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:31.892
And it can be a lot of fun too.

14
00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:33.971
So, when I gave my TEDx talk,

15
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.807
I used a them of TEA, T-E-A, TEA.

16
00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:39.961
TEA solving all problems in the world,

17
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.402
Technology, Education and Acceptance.

18
00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:46.669
And I included many quotes about tea,

19
00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:48.248
which was a lot of fun.

20
00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.864
And it was unique, it was different as well,

21
00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:51.127
I had a good time with it.

22
00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:54.710
So, stay true to your theme if you want to.

23
00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:58.218
And some presenters stay true

24
00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:00.331
to a particular theme in virtually

25
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.989
every presentation they do.

26
00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.261
Like Steve Jobs did per these slides here.

27
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.888
I personally love having different themes

28
00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:11.518
for all of my presentations,

29
00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:14.515
as I love to kinda think of each one

30
00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:17.372
as a different experience.

31
00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:19.959
And, great musicians and film directors

32
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.137
really mix up their presentations

33
00:01:22.137 --> 00:01:24.270
or their masterpieces,

34
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.035
and they have different themes

35
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:29.134
for different things that they create.

36
00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:33.110
You know, retro themes can work well as well.

37
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.428
Or a period piece where a theme stays

38
00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.696
in the same historical time period

39
00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:41.415
in order to remain consistent.

40
00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:43.760
Here's some examples that have

41
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.914
a thematic historical consistency to them.

42
00:01:47.914 --> 00:01:49.886
Audiences love consistency

43
00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.782
and themes that they appreciate.

44
00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:53.721
And they really appreciate the hard work

45
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.542
that you put into it to stay consistent with the theme.

46
00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:00.835
They see it as art and everybody loves art.

47
00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:04.302
And this will really help for you to stand out as well.

48
00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:09.166
Now, when it comes to the tense that you use on your slides,

49
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:11.342
please be consistent as well.

50
00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:13.372
Kinda like on your resume.

51
00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:15.627
For all of your historical work experience,

52
00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:18.207
you write them in the past tense,

53
00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:20.312
like managed a group of people

54
00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:24.809
or created an Oscar worthy presentation, which you will.

55
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.320
Also, try to stick with one or two fonts as well,

56
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.901
if you want, as it can kinda be distracting

57
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.553
if you use too many different types of fonts

58
00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.370
when you're quoting people from different periods

59
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.407
that sort of thing, etc.

60
00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:40.503
It's up to you, it's up to you.

61
00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:42.287
Play around with it and just have fun.
