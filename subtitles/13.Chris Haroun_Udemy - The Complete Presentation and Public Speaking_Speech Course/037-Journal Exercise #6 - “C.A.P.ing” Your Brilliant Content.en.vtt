00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.051
I bet that you just read that

2
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:13.651
using Morgan Freeman's voice.

3
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.734
You know I'm right. Okay.

4
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.173
Welcome to Journal Exercise Number 6

5
00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:24.340
which is called C.A.P, "C.A.Ping Your Brilliant Content".

6
00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:28.991
Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor.

7
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:29.824
His performance in

8
00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:33.721
"The Shawshank Redemption" was impeccable.

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:38.530
And when he speaks, everything he says sounds so awesome,

10
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.042
so soothing, so perfective and so poetic.

11
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.920
Professor Chris Haroun

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.087
is the worst teacher ever.

13
00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:51.140
He was actually in this movie called "The Bucket List".

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.970
This movie, "The Bucket List", has the tagline here

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.970
"time to start living". I love that.

16
00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:03.396
Some other actor here named Jack Nicholas,

17
00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:08.636
I think he golfs as well, he's in this.

18
00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:09.469
Just kidding.

19
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.937
So this Jack guy was in the movie too.

20
00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.345
And they created this movie called "The Bucket List".

21
00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:17.316
And "The Bucket List" means a list

22
00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:20.316
of everything you want to do in life

23
00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:23.428
but you've not done yet.

24
00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:26.966
In this movie, they talk about going to the pyramids.

25
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:31.748
On you list can be skydiving, driving a race car,

26
00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:32.766
or whatever it might be.

27
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.436
Make your own bucket list one day.

28
00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:38.554
A lot of people make these bucket lists

29
00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:41.137
and they're not really ordered.

30
00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.417
They're just kind of a collection

31
00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.334
of brilliant things you'll do one .

32
00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.469
Hold on a second.

33
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.386
I want to do this where you will remember this.

34
00:01:53.704 --> 00:01:55.684
This is my bucket list cap.

35
00:01:55.684 --> 00:01:59.017
See, I'm wearing a cap, C-A-P.

36
00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:02.566
C-A-P stands for

37
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:06.078
C is cider, remember cider was the last lecture,

38
00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:06.937
lecture before that.

39
00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:10.135
C-I-D-E-R, that's the C.

40
00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:12.218
The A and then there's P.

41
00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:15.937
A stands for audience.

42
00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:18.387
P stands for purpose.

43
00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:21.158
We covered both of these in earlier exercises.

44
00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:23.707
C-A-P, CAP.

45
00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:27.558
What you say in your speech should adhere to C-A-P.

46
00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:31.284
Meaning cider, audience, and purpose.

47
00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:36.175
We're gonna make sure that we remember CAP, C-A-P

48
00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:41.017
with everything that we put into our speech for our content.

49
00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:44.850
Everything we say must go into the CAP bucket.

50
00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:48.343
Stay with me, please.

51
00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:50.903
This will all make sense in a second.

52
00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:54.262
We need to ask ourselves the following questions

53
00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:57.818
when we create the content for our speech.

54
00:02:57.818 --> 00:03:01.068
Are the items in our bucket convincing?

55
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:06.968
Are the items in this bucket interesting?

56
00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.631
Are the items in this bucket different?

57
00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:14.391
Are the items in this bucket educational?

58
00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:16.860
Are the items in this bucket relevant?

59
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.357
Remember the so what test.
(trumpets)

60
00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:21.108
Cider, that's the C in CAP.

61
00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:25.166
Are the items in this bucket targeted at our audience?

62
00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:27.047
Right, the A.

63
00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:29.759
Are the items in this bucket helping

64
00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.456
to discuss the purpose of our presentation.

65
00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:37.618
They have to adhere to A and they have to adhere to P.

66
00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.108
We're gonna go through

67
00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:42.897
every single thing we documented already

68
00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:44.946
in journal exercise number five.

69
00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:46.330
And we're gonna ask ourselves

70
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.413
"does this item that we wrote down go in the CAP,

71
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.957
C-A-P bucket or not?".

72
00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.496
This will make sense, in a second. Stay with me.

73
00:03:57.496 --> 00:04:00.988
Meaning, is the item we wrote down,

74
00:04:00.988 --> 00:04:04.905
does it satisfy one of these five things for C?

75
00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:08.490
Is it convincing, interesting, different,

76
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.538
educational, or relevant?

77
00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:12.588
And also it has to make sure

78
00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:14.858
that you're targeting the right audience.

79
00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:16.803
And that you're answering the purpose of your speech.

80
00:04:16.803 --> 00:04:18.595
The A and the P.

81
00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:20.323
Don't overthink this please.

82
00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:24.522
Just write down yes or no in the silver C-A-P,

83
00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:26.272
CAP column right now.

84
00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:30.605
And if you want, copy and paste a completed table

85
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:33.143
that you did in exercise number five

86
00:04:33.143 --> 00:04:35.805
and paste it here in exercise number six.

87
00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:37.543
Or just complete the silver column and leave it

88
00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:38.685
in exercise five.

89
00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:40.339
Either way works.

90
00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.790
Are the items in this bucket list

91
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.957
convincing, interesting, different, educational, relevant?

92
00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:54.870
The A and P in CAP stands for audience and purpose

93
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.478
which we covered in earlier exercises.

94
00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:01.958
Now if this seems a bit confusing to you,

95
00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.028
then just write down yes or no

96
00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:09.111
to the answer so what.
(trumpets\}

97
00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.712
Is this item meeting the purpose or goal of my speech?

98
00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:14.712
Yes or no.

99
00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:15.992
Meaning so what.
(trumpets)

100
00:05:15.992 --> 00:05:17.462
In that silver column.

101
00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:20.742
And please pause me and then come back to me

102
00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:25.569
once you've answered yes or no in the silver column.

103
00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:26.622
This will make a lot of sense.

104
00:05:26.622 --> 00:05:27.455
Thank you.

105
00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:34.830
I hope you did it. Thanks.

106
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.352
After you've completed the exercise

107
00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:40.240
by writing yes or no in all the silver-shaded buckets

108
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.451
then I want you to delete or draw a line

109
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:48.302
through all the rows that had the word no as the answer.

110
00:05:48.302 --> 00:05:50.861
As you can see, I did it here.

111
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.422
And the reason is because we don't want

112
00:05:52.422 --> 00:05:56.342
to include these lines in our presentation.

113
00:05:56.342 --> 00:06:00.509
Separately, one day when you create your own bucket list

114
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.880
I hope your bucket list of items is a presentation

115
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.822
to more than 10,000 people
(fingers snap)

116
00:06:06.822 --> 00:06:08.620
and you enjoy doing it too.

117
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.620
Feeling alive out there.

118
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.142
Now if you have any questions about this exercise

119
00:06:14.142 --> 00:06:16.240
just please let me know.

120
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.360
Again, if it's too much work

121
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.000
just kind of answer the question,

122
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.600
"is this relevant?"

123
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.267
In the silver column by answering yes or no.

124
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.702
And then delete the lines where you wrote no.

125
00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:32.600
Again please let me know if you have any questions.

126
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.902
Thank you.

127
00:06:33.902 --> 00:06:35.611
Professor Chris Haroun

128
00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:37.401
is the worst teacher ever.
