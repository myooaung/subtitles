1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:03,105
Let's talk about customizing and adding images

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:04,934
using PowerPoint.

3
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:05,767
So first of all,

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,805
let's go and get an image.

5
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:10,732
So I'm going to my favorite image website,

6
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:12,503
which is GraphicStock.

7
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:15,446
And let's just type in the word minimal.

8
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:16,428
So let's grab this one here.

9
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:18,106
Okay, so we'll download it.

10
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:20,023
It's a very small file.

11
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:22,551
All right.

12
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:23,651
Great.

13
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:25,662
We'll insert it,

14
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:27,985
we'll go to downloads here,

15
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,543
and this is the image.

16
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:30,376
Okay.

17
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:31,502
Very simplistic.

18
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:32,959
We can change the size.

19
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,379
We can manipulate it quite a bit.

20
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:38,051
Okay and so first of all, let me kick it off with borders

21
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,641
and then I'll change the colors and what not.

22
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,159
And very soon, in a couple minutes,

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,336
I'm gonna show you how to get rid of

24
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,120
what's in the background

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,790
for making an image transparent

26
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,229
which adds a nice pop effect.

27
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,804
So first of all, we can customize

28
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,888
the background of our image using all of these.

29
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:53,983
I won't spend too much time on this,

30
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,816
but it's a lot of fun.

31
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:59,367
And Keynote, you can do the same thing as well.

32
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:00,685
Okay, great.

33
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,874
Now if we click on picture format,

34
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:06,418
let's change the transparency, right?

35
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,918
You can make it hardly visible

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,441
or you can make it much more visible.

37
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:13,644
And you can always go here

38
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:16,552
which is resetting the picture, okay?

39
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:20,166
We can change the color as well right here.

40
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,775
And that is that for this one.

41
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,544
Let's do another one now, okay?

42
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:25,572
Delete.

43
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:28,319
Let's get something that's a little bit more advanced.

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,319
Okay, let's get the sun.

45
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:36,891
And say we wanted to use this one here,

46
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:38,946
but we didn't want that background, right?

47
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:41,126
So I'll show you how to do that.

48
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:44,459
We go again, insert, picture, from file,

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,075
there's the sun.

50
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:47,930
Okay cool.

51
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,671
Say we want to get rid of the black background

52
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,071
around the outside.

53
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,960
So what you do is you go here to remove background, right?

54
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,035
Microsoft it makes it pretty simple to do.

55
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,110
Okay.

56
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,558
And whenever you see purple,

57
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:02,115
that's what's gonna be removed, okay?

58
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:05,860
But I want to remove everything around the side of it

59
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,564
and not forget about that little corner piece there.

60
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:10,731
Let's go here,

61
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:13,665
and then click here,

62
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:14,849
and you're done.

63
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:17,196
And it looks a little bit,

64
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:18,223
I don't know, it doesn't look like there's a

65
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:19,868
clean outside portion to this.

66
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,044
So what you could do is

67
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:22,464
you could actually crop it, right?

68
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:25,762
And so cropping basically allows you to

69
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,892
change the size of the image

70
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:29,360
or what you wanna see, that sort of thing.

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,251
Let me just get out of there.

72
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,669
I'm wanna show you how to crop a circular image as well.

73
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:35,757
Okay?

74
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,840
You can go crop to shape.

75
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,792
Okay, then you can resize it,

76
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,296
do whatever you want to artistically as well, right?

77
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:48,381
And because it's color,

78
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:51,636
you can do a lot more artistic effects here.

79
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:53,306
So let's click this guy here.

80
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,555
Looks like if this sun was in the movie The Matrix

81
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:58,118
it would look like that.

82
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:00,984
Then let's say we don't want the green Matrix sun anymore.

83
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:03,265
We go here to color

84
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:05,465
and we can alter it a little bit.

85
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:06,511
Say for some reason,

86
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,085
you want to have, I don't know, a blue moon.

87
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:11,943
And then if we go to artistic effects,

88
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,768
we can change it to look a little bit more grainy

89
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:16,407
or whatever that is.

90
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:18,119
And then if you wanted to resize it,

91
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,197
throw it in the corner,

92
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:20,189
you can do that sort of thing.

93
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,472
So it's pretty powerful.

94
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,284
There's a lot of really cool basic things you can do here.

95
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:26,353
Again, PhotoShop is much more advanced

96
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,441
but I want to keep it simplistic

97
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,258
and just have you work smarter but not harder.

98
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,369
Now let's grab another image

99
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:35,062
to see if we can layer on top of that one.

100
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,165
So we'll go back here.

101
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:38,573
We still have the keyword search sun.

102
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:39,709
Scroll down,

103
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,454
let's just grab any random image.

104
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:45,060
Let's grab this guy here, okay.

105
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,311
And then we'll insert it,

106
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,344
pictures,

107
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,511
here we go.

108
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,708
Let's say that, I don't know,

109
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,597
we want to put the sun right on top of that.

110
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,772
But you see how it's in the background, the sun?

111
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:56,736
So what you do is,

112
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,678
and all Microsoft applications

113
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:00,471
and programmers on Microsoft platforms

114
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,779
try to anticipate what you want to do

115
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,542
when you right click on something.

116
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,788
So let's right click on this. Right?

117
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,093
And what you can do is you can say,

118
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,104
hey, bring it to the front place.

119
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:11,222
Okay?

120
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,472
So there is is there, okay?

121
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,438
And then you're like,

122
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,573
well I kind of want to see

123
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,217
part of that background image, right?

124
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,437
So what you can do is you can go to transparency here, okay?

125
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,187
And make it somewhat transparent.

126
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:28,938
Right, you see that?

127
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:30,992
It's kind of a nice little touch.

128
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,054
All right.

129
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,182
So let's resize this,

130
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:35,946
make it the size of the sun there.

131
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:37,204
I don't know why you'd want to do this,

132
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,456
but whatever.

133
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:39,505
It's kind of cool.

134
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,065
Looks like the moon is on the sun now.

135
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,736
Okay, and then for this image here,

136
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:45,147
let's say we want to manipulate this one

137
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,050
a little bit as well.

138
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,383
So you can go here to remove background.

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,002
And whenever you see purple,

140
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,383
that's the stuff that's going to be removed, okay?

141
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:58,533
So let's say for fun,

142
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,040
I don't know why you'd do this,

143
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,659
but we just want to have a couple

144
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:04,626
of these green leaves shown, right?

145
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:05,745
But for some reason,

146
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:09,311
we don't want to have any blue background.

147
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,701
Okay.

148
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,655
So very high quality images,

149
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,453
meaning ones that take up a lot of space,

150
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:17,542
can be more manipulated than others, okay?

151
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,671
And when you do what I'm about to show you,

152
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,975
you're gonna make a lot of mistakes, right?

153
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,587
So it's never perfect.

154
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,426
So you hit Control+Z and you keep doing it

155
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,187
until it looks perfect for you.

156
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:28,169
Okay?

157
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,336
So let me just take a second here to make these changes.

158
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,204
And it takes a while to make it perfect.

159
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,245
What I'm gonna do now is

160
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,554
I'm gonna go on fast forward,

161
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:43,554
and I'll show you the final product.

162
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,753
Okay and let's say we're done.

163
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:58,382
You click outside here

164
00:05:58,382 --> 00:05:59,279
and there you have it.

165
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,450
Just the leaves.

166
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,700
Okay, and that doesn't look that great,

167
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,559
so let's get a different backdrop

168
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,622
to throw in the background just for fun.

169
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:07,208
Okay, so let's go here

170
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,493
and we'll search for, I don't know,

171
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:10,326
sky.

172
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,053
Okay, sky, and then we'll insert it.

173
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:19,386
Insert, sky,

174
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,766
here you go.

175
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:23,936
Cool.

176
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:28,233
Okay, now we want to add this sky to the back.

177
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,941
So again, you right click

178
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,941
and you go send to back.

179
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,354
Okay it's looking better.

180
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:48,922
Let's say we want to add some birds there as well.

181
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:51,172
So let me go here to birds.

182
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,400
And this won't look that realistic.

183
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,733
But that's okay.

184
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:09,079
And let's say we want to add a shadow.

185
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,912
There you go.

186
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,192
So you know, PowerPoint is pretty powerful

187
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,753
when it comes to this stuff.

188
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,394
Lot of people don't give it enough credit for this,

189
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,712
but there you go.

190
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:17,545
There you go.

191
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,047
I mean it's not an amazing image,

192
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:22,924
but I showed you how to get rid of a background, right?

193
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:24,341
It's pretty cool.

194
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,546
So let's say that you have a lot of images

195
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:30,099
and you can't remember what's the very back,

196
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,100
what's the beginning.

197
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,819
And say you want to bring this blue moon

198
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,674
in front of the birds for whatever reason.

199
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:38,654
So you can go here to arrange,

200
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,526
and then select reorder objects.

201
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:42,868
And this is pretty cool.

202
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:45,100
Okay, so and I showed you this before really quickly.

203
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,442
So say we want to throw the blue moon in front.

204
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:48,298
You could do that.

205
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,858
You click okay.

206
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,358
Now let's say I wanted the birds and the moon

207
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,690
to stay together

208
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,360
because I always want them to stick together

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,021
when I'm moving images around

210
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,266
and it gets kind of complicated otherwise.

211
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,226
Control+Z.

212
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,313
Here's what you're gonna do.

213
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,897
Now if I just click on the birds,

214
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:04,760
watch what happens.

215
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,770
It gets confused,

216
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,977
it's like no, I'm choosing this.

217
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,678
So what you have to do is

218
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:12,777
you have to kind of zoom out a bit.

219
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,694
Go down here, zoom out.

220
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,480
And then you highlight around it

221
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,955
by clicking there and highlighting what you want

222
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,168
to group together.

223
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,277
There they are.

224
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:25,646
Then you right click and you say group,

225
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:29,062
and those are together now, okay?

226
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:32,114
Now let's say I wanted to export this image

227
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:35,314
and maybe throw it into an email or something, whatever.

228
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,228
So what I can do is this.

229
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:38,240
You hit Control+A,

230
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,073
Copy,

231
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,341
and then what you do is you say

232
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,008
Paste Special, okay?

233
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:47,068
And you paste it as a picture, okay?

234
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,507
Now.

235
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,950
This item here is a picture.

236
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,615
All that stuff is together, okay?

237
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:56,948
And let's say I wanted to crop it a bit.

238
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,294
Okay, so you go up here to picture format,

239
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:02,127
crop,

240
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:05,341
and then we can crop it.

241
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:09,341
So we want to have kind of a nicer, neater look.

242
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:14,068
And then you can right click on it

243
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:16,171
and say save it as a picture, right?

244
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,976
And you save it as a picture,

245
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:19,486
many different formats,

246
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:20,826
and you can insert in email

247
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,458
or do whatever you want to do with that.

248
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,282
Now let's say I wanted to have a shadow on this.

249
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:28,810
We copy it,

250
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,367
throw in a new slide.

251
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,921
Remember you gotta right click, okay?

252
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:35,305
And then I'm gonna hit paste,

253
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:38,362
and then I go here to picture format,

254
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:39,891
and I can add a shadow like that,

255
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:42,897
which is just the style that I personally like.

256
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:44,416
And then if we were to play it,

257
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,842
it would look like this. Right?

258
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:47,933
It's kinda neat.

259
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,468
Kinda neat, let me go up a screen

260
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:50,501
and see what the previous image looks like.

261
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:54,224
And play around with the picture formatting here.

262
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:57,064
There's so many cool things you can do, right?

263
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,760
It looks really, really awesome.

264
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,111
Now you can only apply one of these things at a time, right?

265
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,508
It's a little bit limited.

266
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:06,462
But hey, it's so easy to use.

267
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,019
Sometimes I like to have this here

268
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,769
where you can see the reflection.

269
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,313
And let's just delete this.

270
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,867
And say I wanted to have kinda more cool effects

271
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,375
with the leaves here.

272
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,692
Corn, or whatever that is.

273
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,692
I go here to artistic effects, okay?

274
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,422
Looks neat.

275
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:28,991
And say we want to change the birds around,

276
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,803
but this is already grouped, remember?

277
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:33,612
So we're gonna have to ungroup this.

278
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:34,810
Group,

279
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,727
ungroup.

280
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:44,152
And say for this background here,

281
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:46,337
say we want to change that around as well.

282
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:49,753
Let's go to artistic effects here.

283
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:51,586
Let's try another one.

284
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,988
Isn't that wild?

285
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,275
Let's take a look at it.

286
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,331
Pretty cool, huh?

287
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:03,160
That's from layering.

288
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,139
Amazing, amazing.

289
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,475
If you have any questions about

290
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,172
manipulating pictures with PowerPoint,

291
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,049
please let me know.

292
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,058
There's a lot of cool stuff you can do.

293
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:10,891
Thanks.
