1
00:00:00,784 --> 00:00:03,156
I've always been a risk taker, right.

2
00:00:03,156 --> 00:00:04,486
It hasn't always helped my career

3
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:06,316
but it's just the way I am,

4
00:00:06,316 --> 00:00:09,767
and I want to please challenge you to be different

5
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:11,827
especially when you present

6
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:15,116
as it will help your audience remember your presentation

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,989
years later, okay?

8
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,956
And I mentioned Roberto Benigni's Oscar speech earlier

9
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,999
which was amazing.

10
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:26,592
It's way over the top, right,

11
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:28,761
but I remember it really well, and I love it.

12
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:31,013
I love his passion, okay?

13
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:34,489
And in the business school classes that I teach at

14
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,561
in universities I sometimes I'll stand on a chair

15
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,372
or a desk during one part of my classes.

16
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,682
Here I am, I'm still here, okay?

17
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:48,135
And I'll do this because

18
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:52,324
I'm talking about the importance of seeing the forest

19
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:54,300
from the trees, right,

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,123
and how when you look at the total adjustable market

21
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,534
for a certain industry you're considering investing in,

22
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,836
you have to understand the size of the market,

23
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:05,765
and see the trends higher up,

24
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:10,332
and focus on the forest, and again, not the trees, right?

25
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,575
So, anyway I do that

26
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:17,408
and think it's a class that

27
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:19,576
my students don't forget, right?

28
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:22,750
And they all remember what TAM stands for

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,583
because of that class,

30
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,889
which is total addressable market, okay?

31
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,509
Everyone pays attention when I do that

32
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,838
because it's unique, it's different, it's unconventional,

33
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,280
and I don't care what anyone thinks, right?

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,124
So, just kidding, sort of, nevermind, right.

35
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:41,902
Please dare yourself to do something radically different.

36
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,014
And Apple actually had an advertising campaign

37
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:49,014
that aired first in 1997 called Think Different,

38
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:55,840
and not only did this campaign help to rescue

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,457
the company from bankruptcy with the help of Steve Jobs,

40
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:02,621
of course, but it also redefined the company,

41
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:07,178
and it put it on a long-term trajectory

42
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:11,221
to becoming the most valuable company on the planet, right?

43
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,923
And I want you to also please think different

44
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:17,700
when you present, okay?

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,867
And this commercial was aired on the 28th of September 1997

46
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:27,980
during the television premier of the movie Toy Story,

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,239
you know, which was creative,

48
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,850
by Pixar, of course, of which Steve Jobs

49
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,557
was the largest shareholder.

50
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:37,807
Check it out.

51
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:44,099
I want you to please take a chance in your life,

52
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,523
and in your career and present differently

53
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,570
as one speech can change your life

54
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,746
and touch the hearts of so many people around you.

55
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:58,413
Life all comes down to a few short moments.
