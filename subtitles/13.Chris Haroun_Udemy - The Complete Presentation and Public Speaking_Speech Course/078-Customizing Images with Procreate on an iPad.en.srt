1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
All right, I want to show you Procreate.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,888
See that little app there on my iPad.

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,074
In the bottom left-hand corner before I get started

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,281
you'll see the little image I just threw on top there,

5
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:12,424
which tells you how you can record

6
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,202
your iPhone or your iPad.

7
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,500
It's easy, you plug in the lightning cable

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,268
that came with the iPad or the iPod or iPhone or whatever,

9
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:22,765
you plug it into your USB port on your Mac,

10
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:25,098
and then you go to New Movie

11
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:29,821
within Quicktime, which is right here.

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,450
Let me see, yeah, New Movie Recording.

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,307
And then you'll see in the bottom left-hand corner there

14
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:38,910
I selected to use my blue Yeti microphone, which rocks,

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,181
and then Screen from the iPad.

16
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:43,104
Okay, let me just show you here Procreate.

17
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,871
This one's a bit more advanced,

18
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:48,926
I know I said before that I don't like using Photoshop yet.

19
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:51,967
This one you have to actually put in Layers, which I hate.

20
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,217
But let's do a Layer, okay.

21
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,606
So, see that Layer there?

22
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:02,919
I kind of, look closely here, let me zoom in.

23
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:05,268
Okay, you see the globe here?

24
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:10,049
I want to make it look a little bit better, so watch this.

25
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,165
I don't know, I want a little bit more white there.

26
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:15,347
So you actually create a Layer, right?

27
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,459
And you add it on entirely.

28
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,234
So, let's try one.

29
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:21,926
So let's create a new Layer, okay?

30
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:24,532
And now we're actually painting,

31
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,870
we're gonna manipulate this Layer here

32
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,142
and we can turn it off, okay?

33
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:32,817
So let's say that we want to paint something over top.

34
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,984
Let's make our brush big.

35
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:39,709
You can paint here, right?

36
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,082
And say you wanted to keep that,

37
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,099
or say you wanted to get rid of just that,

38
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,113
so watch this, I deselect the Layer,

39
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:48,331
boom, the Layer's gone, okay?

40
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,698
Okay, let's say I wanted to add

41
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:53,537
kind of a cooler, texturized background there on the board,

42
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,097
what I can do is I can click here,

43
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:58,819
I can, say, let's put a grid,

44
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,426
let's paint a grid, see what that looks like.

45
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:05,153
You see that grid there, in the background?

46
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:09,219
It's kind of a neat little touch, like that, right?

47
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,847
And then, I can export this,

48
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:16,485
and I can turn that Layer off too if I want to, see?

49
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:18,902
Okay, so what you do is then,

50
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,310
you can go and you can export this image

51
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,791
and then import it into PowerPoint

52
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,958
or Keynote or Google Slides or whatever it is you use.
