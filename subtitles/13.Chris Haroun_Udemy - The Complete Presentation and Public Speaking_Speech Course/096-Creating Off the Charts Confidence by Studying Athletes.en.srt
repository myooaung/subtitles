1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:03,114
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,741
Let's talk about creating off the charts confidence

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,912
by studying elite professional athletes.

4
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:12,695
In my very humble opinion,

5
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,855
baseball pitching great Bob Gibson

6
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:17,904
had arguably the best season of any professional athlete

7
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:19,654
in the world in 1968.

8
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,914
Nobody's more fearless or more competitive

9
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:26,874
or more confident than Bob Gibson.

10
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:29,685
He said that he wasn't just in the zone

11
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,294
on one or two occasions in 1968,

12
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:34,634
he was in the zone for the entire year.

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,341
And if you have time, check out this interview with him.

14
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,424
It's amazing.

15
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:42,114
He had the best season in baseball history.

16
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:43,531
He was a pitcher.

17
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,424
He was a pitcher.

18
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,074
For those of you not familiar with pitching,

19
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,695
some people say that it's a primal battle

20
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:56,778
between a man with a stick and a man with a rock.

21
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,634
Without confidence, you can't shine.

22
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:03,333
How is there not a movie

23
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,944
about this baseball legend, Bob Gibson?

24
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:08,245
I want you and I, you and me,

25
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:10,435
not sure which grammar's correct,

26
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:12,244
I want us, how's that? (laughs)

27
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:15,275
I want us to be in the B.G.Z.

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,824
I want us to be in the B.G.Z.,

29
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:19,241
which is the Bob Gibson Zone.

30
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,565
In 1968, he dominated baseball.

31
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:26,685
And in that interview that you can watch if you want to,

32
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:29,104
he said it never felt like work.

33
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:29,937
That's that way you gotta be.

34
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,013
It's gotta feel like you love what you're doing

35
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:34,875
when you're presenting, otherwise you won't shine up there.

36
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:35,965
It's tough to act.

37
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:40,451
You gotta kind of just be you up there and have fun.

38
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:43,093
When you present and when you prepare to present,

39
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:45,086
again make sure it feels like

40
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:46,831
something you absolutely love doing,

41
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:49,493
or you won't be really confident.

42
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:51,594
And I'm talking to you right now,

43
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,583
and I'm so passionate about what I do

44
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,583
that I don't have a job.

45
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:59,530
I'm successful if you're successful.

46
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,293
If you're not successful presenting, I'm a failure.

47
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:04,364
We're in this together.

48
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:08,493
Together, we're going to get into this zone

49
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:12,183
where we can passionately create our speech

50
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:16,124
and deliver not a presentation, but we will deliver

51
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:19,291
a passionate and confident experience.

52
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:24,874
There's nothing better than watching somebody

53
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:27,943
who's incredibly passionate about their profession.

54
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:31,423
Like Jodie Foster, for example, in the movie Contact.

55
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:33,173
Check out this clip if you have time.

56
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,354
She's so passionate.

57
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,533
You gotta respect that.

58
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,643
And I really respect professional athletes

59
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,924
when they're really passionate about what they're doing,

60
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:42,034
or anybody, for that matter, that's passionate

61
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,213
about their trade.

62
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,674
I love watching movies about people

63
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:49,244
that are really inspiring and confident

64
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:52,034
and believe they can change the world.

65
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:55,423
Another example is Jeff Bridges in Tucker.

66
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:58,213
Great movie, great movie.

67
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:01,394
Please condition yourself to know that you love

68
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:03,645
what you are doing.

69
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:07,564
If you love what you do, then you'll be even more confident,

70
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:11,954
and you can condition yourself to believe that.

71
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:14,154
Most people that are at the top of their game

72
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:16,654
see it as a game and not work,

73
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:21,623
and they're incredibly confident because of that.

74
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:23,493
It's interesting, because you watch professional athletes

75
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,410
and sometimes they get upset on TV,

76
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:29,345
and they don't really care

77
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:31,445
that the whole world is watching their emotions.

78
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,586
They're just them.

79
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:34,295
It's interesting.

80
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:35,945
So I want you to have the focus.

81
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:37,265
I want you to have the confidence.

82
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:41,735
I want you to have the determination of an elite athlete,

83
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,311
not just for your presentation event day,

84
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:48,005
but for the whole preparation stage.

85
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,594
I want you to put it all on the line.

86
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:53,677
This is all that matters.

87
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:57,997
So confidence is like a light switch,

88
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:01,335
and it comes from within.

89
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:05,252
Only you have the power to turn on that switch.

90
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:11,805
Whether or not you think you can do something, you're right.

91
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,145
I'm gonna say that again.

92
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:17,746
Whether or not you think you can do something, you're right.

93
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:21,585
I don't personally know what your favorite sport is.

94
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:24,605
But whatever it is, please study the best athletes

95
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:29,186
in that sport and watch interviews with them on YouTube

96
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,586
and highlight reels of their accomplishments

97
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:34,905
as confidence is incredibly contagious.

98
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:38,125
And not all athletes are very well-spoken,

99
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,205
but when they interview, they don't really care.

100
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,005
They don't care, they're just confident.

101
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,594
They're in that zone, and I want you

102
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,834
to be in that zone too, please.

103
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:50,426
These elite athletes also don't care what they look like.

104
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,546
A lot of them go out in the field

105
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,794
and they put that black stuff under their eye,

106
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,825
and they just don't care.

107
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:57,375
And then baseball, it's interesting,

108
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,872
a lot of them have beards now and long hair, whatever.

109
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:00,705
It is what it is.

110
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,645
They don't care what others think of them.

111
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:05,545
They're in the confidence zone.

112
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:09,906
And if they cared about what other people thought,

113
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:11,615
they would be distracted.

114
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,198
They are money, and so are you.

115
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,413
Please use your own unique style

116
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,244
and don't be influenced by other people,

117
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:25,533
especially those people with a dangerous combination

118
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,925
of being arrogant and ignorant.

119
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:32,812
You know exactly who I'm talking about.

120
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,071
Again, you be you and ignore what others think.

121
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:39,988
This is the winning, confident athlete attitude

122
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:42,653
that I want you to use.

123
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,403
Use their philosophy.

124
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,569
Separately, thank God for these people.

125
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:54,137
Thank God they were very confident,

126
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,970
or the world would be a different place today.

127
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:03,024
By the same token, if you become more confident

128
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:07,857
and present better, think of how you will make

129
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:10,607
the entire world a better place.

130
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,940
I have to repeat that again.

131
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:16,796
If you become more confident and present better,

132
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:20,036
think of how you will make the entire world a better place.

133
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:22,987
You can make a difference, and you will.

134
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:26,227
By the same token, if you become more confident

135
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:29,828
and present better, think of how you will make the lives

136
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:32,411
of everybody around you better.

137
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:38,148
Anyone that hurts your confidence,

138
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,747
I want you to please write them off and never see them again

139
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:44,954
if you can, because they are standing in the way

140
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:46,704
of you and greatness.

141
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,276
And separately, unjustified criticism is nothing more

142
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:53,887
than a disguised compliment.

143
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:54,720
I have to say that again.

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,628
Sorry I'm repeating things,

145
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,987
but this quote means so much to me.

146
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,492
Unjustified criticism is nothing more

147
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:03,537
than a disguised compliment.

148
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:04,937
So bring it on, doubters.

149
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:07,248
As you get even more successful in your life

150
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:09,969
and in your career, you can get criticized more.

151
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,977
But again, just think of that quote.

152
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:14,169
Unjustified criticism is nothing more

153
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,827
than a disguised compliment.

154
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:19,027
So bring it on, doubters, because when you criticize me

155
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:21,897
and it's unjustified, that's a compliment.

156
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:24,314
I love it, and so should you.

157
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,758
Confidence comes from within.

158
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:31,747
Turn on that switch and get in that zone

159
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,627
when preparing for and when delivering your masterpiece

160
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:35,627
of a speech.

161
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:39,414
Whether or not you think you can, you are right.

162
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:42,267
And the only thing that matters opinion-wise

163
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,600
is your opinion of yourself.

164
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:49,960
(upbeat music)
