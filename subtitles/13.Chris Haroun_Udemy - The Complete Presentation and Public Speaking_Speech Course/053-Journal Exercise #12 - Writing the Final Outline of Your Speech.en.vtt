Welcome to exercise number 12.

2
00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.417
We're making a lot of progress here, okay.

3
00:00:05.417 --> 00:00:08.334
Completing this exercise is crucial

4
00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:11.353
because it's actually gonna be the basis

5
00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:13.620
and foundation of the slides that you're

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.991
going to enjoy creating in act number four.

7
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:20.980
This exercise is not that hard

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.057
as a lot of it will be just copying and pasting

9
00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:27.224
from previous exercises with a few minor modifications.

10
00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:30.187
So please take your time with this

11
00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:31.806
as it's really gonna help us

12
00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:35.463
with the slide creation process in act number four

13
00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:38.906
and then with the delivery we're going to perfect

14
00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.406
in act number six.

15
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.356
So please open your success journal

16
00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:47.022
and turn to exercise number 12.

17
00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:49.651
In this exercise, we're gonna incorporate

18
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.032
the feedback from exercise number 11,

19
00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:54.429
if we have any feedback.

20
00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.807
And we will prepare our entire speech outline

21
00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:02.222
from start to end, so that we can create the slides

22
00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:05.632
in the next act which is act number four.

23
00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.775
Again, please take your time with this exercise

24
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:11.366
as it's crucial for the slide creation process.

25
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.187
And if it feels like work,

26
00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:16.195
or if you aren't in the right frame of mind

27
00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:18.423
to do this exercise, then please come back

28
00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:21.325

29
00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:23.590
if you want to, okay.

30
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.476
And there are five steps in this exercise.

31
00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:28.826
Step one of five is optional,

32
00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:30.928
and it's the presentation title.

33
00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:34.007

at the end of exercise number nine per this video.

59
00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:52.557
Okay, almost done.

60
00:04:52.557 --> 00:04:55.667
Lastly, in terms of step number five of five,

61
00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:58.694
please review the contents that you just pasted

62
00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.861
into this entire exercise,

63
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:04.973
and reorder it, or make changes to it,

64
00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:08.768
until it feels like a solid awesome outline.

65
00:05:08.768 --> 00:05:10.802
And please feel free to use the feedback

66
00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:13.747
you gathered from the previous exercise,

67
00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:15.629
meaning exercise number 11,

68
00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.211
when you changed the outline of your presentation, etc.

69
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:21.050
So just take your time with this, okay.

70
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.692
We're gonna use the contents from this exercise

71
00:05:22.692 --> 00:05:25.859
to make our slides in act number four.

72
00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:30.816
This whole process in this course

73
00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.890
really makes you appreciate how much work

74
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.027
is involved when making a motion picture,

75
00:05:37.027 --> 00:05:40.736
or writing a book, or creating a music album.

76
00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:45.004
We really want our masterpiece of a speech

77
00:05:45.004 --> 00:05:49.171
to be as awesome an an Academy Award-winning product.

78
00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:53.448
Which is why we are doing all this work.

79
00:05:53.448 --> 00:05:55.895
I think it's a fun process.

80
00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:59.629
Just remember that one speech can change your life

81
00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.495
or touch the hearts of many people.

82
00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:04.324
And that life often comes down to a few short moments,

83
00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:06.972
and this is clearly one of them.

84
00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:08.185
Okay, great.

85
00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:09.731
So thank you and congratulations

86
00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:12.453

87
00:06:12.453 --> 00:06:14.616
