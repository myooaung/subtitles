1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,064
Let's talk about showing props, meaning bringing items

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:07,455
to show other people as a way to start your speech.

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,451
You know, my kids do this in school and it's called

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:13,042
show and tell and it's very memorable for them

5
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:14,349
and for me.

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,113
The classes I remember when I was a kid were show and tell.

7
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:21,863
I remembered what item I brought in or my other friends

8
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,944
brought in, I don't remember what we learned in school.

9
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,826
I remember the things that people brought in.

10
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,355
It was novel, it was unique, it was different,

11
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:29,956
and it was personal, right?

12
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:32,565
It makes you more entertaining, too, as a speaker

13
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,381
as, you know, your audience gets to know you.

14
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,259
So here's what we're going to do.

15
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,525
I'm not going to edit what I'm about to film, okay?

16
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,608
So here I go.

17
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:45,469
I'll kick it off with, I got a bunch of personal items

18
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:47,060
I got in the house here.

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,388
And, again, I'm just gonna wing it and I'm gonna tell

20
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:52,361
a story about, sorry if you can't hear me well,

21
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:56,528
tell a story about some things I have in the house, okay?

22
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:01,547
This product is very, very hard to get.

23
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:05,665
And, you know what, I actually got it for way cheaper

24
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,984
than anybody else that purchased this product before, right?

25
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,046
I'm gonna keep going here.

26
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:12,761
I'm stumbling a bit, it's okay.

27
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,702
This is a Nintendo Switch and it's almost impossible

28
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:18,643
to find at this point of filming.

29
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,197
So how did I get it?

30
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:23,627
Well, my kids really wanted it, right?

31
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:25,297
It's all about the kids, right?

32
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,360
I don't know if I've let them play it yet,

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,851
I play a lot, it's pretty cool, just kidding.

34
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,629
So what I did was I went to all the big stores and they

35
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,305
were sold out everywhere, obviously.

36
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:37,138
So I tried to outthink our competition, right,

37
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,080
and buy this product.

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,939
So here's what I did.

39
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:44,534
I started thinking like other people might, okay,

40
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:46,043
using game theory.

41
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:50,374
And I went to eBay with my kids, and this is awesome, okay?

42
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,909
And we searched for it, the Nintendo Switch costs

43
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,785
a lot of money, right?

44
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:59,352
And I thought what if somebody misspelled the word Nintendo

45
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,003
and so we searched for different renditions of the word

46
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:06,408
Nintendo and we searched for the word Nintento, okay,

47
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:09,429
with a T at the end, T-O instead of D-O,

48
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,732
and that's how we bought this for a very, very low price.

49
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,588
Pretty cool.

50
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:16,484
And I bring this up, I'm back to camera,

51
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:19,427
I bring this up because we have to outsmart

52
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:21,063
our competition as well.

53
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:23,387
We need to use game theory, okay?

54
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,428
Every battle is won before it's been fought

55
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:28,611
and we need to be preemptive and proactive and think

56
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,590
like they might think and be two or three chess moves

57
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,713
ahead of them at all times, all dimes, times, okay.

58
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,267
Alright, so that's one example, okay.

59
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:40,008
I'm gonna give you a couple of other examples.

60
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,196
Again, I'm gonna let this film roll,

61
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,401
I'm not going to edit it at all, okay.

62
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:45,612
And you can skip to the next lecture if you don't have time

63
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:46,779
but here I go.

64
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:52,147
This here is a game-used

65
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:56,648
1987 baseball bat by Andre Dawson.

66
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:00,297
He was the MVP that year and my mom got it for me.

67
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:04,755
It's broken, right, as a Christmas present in the late '80s

68
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,999
and I loved it, it was awesome.

69
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:10,151
And one day I came home from work and my kids were

70
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:14,033
playing baseball with it in the back yard, true story.

71
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,176
I was mortified!

72
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,396
I was like, you can't do that!

73
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,515
And they were like, why, Dad, it's a bat, duh.

74
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,455
And so what I did was I brought it in to work, okay?

75
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,332
This was in 2007 when I worked

76
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,415
for a hedge fund called Pquant.

77
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,499
And I left it there in my office,

78
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,635
and my boss at the time is a guy named Carson Levitt,

79
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:31,615
great guy.

80
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:34,004
Alright, he's my mentor, too, in this industry.

81
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:38,281
He saw Andre Dawson in town here in San Francisco

82
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:41,778
because the All Star game was here at that time

83
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:45,729
and he called me at home one night, right, 2007.

84
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,645
And the phone rang and my wife's like, you know,

85
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,256
Christine said, it's Carson, your boss.

86
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:52,696
I was like, oh, my God.

87
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,016
A boss never calls you at home, am I in trouble?

88
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:56,775
And he said this, he was so cool, he said,

89
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:58,731
"Chris, you're not gonna believe this."

90
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:02,523
"I just saw Andre Dawson at some MLB alumni event

91
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,911
downtown San Francisco."

92
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,376
"I'm not that far away from the office,

93
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:06,982
do you want me to go to the office and get your bat

94
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:08,537
and get it signed?"

95
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:09,964
Hell yeah, I said!

96
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:12,949
And he did that, it's signed here, right?

97
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:15,317
And then I'm gonna make up this next part.

98
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:19,845
And see, this piece of wood, it might be worthless

99
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:21,721
to many people, right?

100
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,744
I mean, a wood of this weight might cost you, I don't know,

101
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,763
20 cents max, or much less than that.

102
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:29,639
But it's actually worth a lot more money than that

103
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,927
because of the sentimental value.

104
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,376
The same can be said for our product.

105
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,699
With the right marketing strategy,

106
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:41,069
we can create product awareness, an incredible sentimental

107
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,222
thought process with our customers such that the products

108
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:49,265
they buy from us are worth much more to them in their hearts

109
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:51,026
than the building materials, okay?

110
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,311
Wasn't perfect, but you get the idea, okay?

111
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:56,819
And, again, you can just delete, or go to the end

112
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:57,918
of this lecture if you want.

113
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,085
I'm gonna give you a couple of more examples, okay.

114
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:07,466
When I was a kid my mom made me read an hour a day, right?

115
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:10,690
And I hated it, right, but it was during the summer

116
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,058
so my brain wouldn't turn to rock.

117
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:17,380
And so I do that with my kids as well and Andrew, my son,

118
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,745
he was born in New York City and so he's the only

119
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,842
New York Yankees fan in the house, right?

120
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:24,961
And, I'm a Blue Jays fan, as you know, right,

121
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,670
from Toronto, but he's a New York fan, right?

122
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,383
Which is not cool but it's okay and here's why.

123
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:32,506
One of the books he chose to read during the summer

124
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:36,384
was a book by Derek Jeter, right, from the New York Yankees.

125
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:39,154
And the book he read was called The Contract.

126
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:42,463
And I asked him to summarize the book and, oh my God,

127
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:45,769
this blew me away because now I understand why Derek Jeter

128
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:49,424
is so successful in every aspect of his life.

129
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:50,341
Here's why.

130
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,962
His parents, every year, I think it was every January,

131
00:05:56,962 --> 00:06:00,719
they would make him write a one page contract from the age

132
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,965
of nine years old and onwards, okay?

133
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,126
And on that one page contract he had to give to his parents

134
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:07,701
he would say stuff like, you know, I'll be polite

135
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,085
to mom and dad, I'll get As and Bs in my courses at school,

136
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:12,923
I'll practice baseball, I'll go to church,

137
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,840
or whatever it might have been, okay?

138
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,040
It's, that's rudimentary goal setting, right?

139
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,708
It's goal setting.

140
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,803
And that's one of the reasons Derek Jeter's so successful,

141
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:24,636
goal setting.

142
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,219
So, write down your goals.

143
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,686
Pretty cool, pretty cool.

144
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,342
Alright, I got another example but I got to go downstairs

145
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:33,009
to get this one so bear with me.

146
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:40,467
(grunting)

147
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,843
Okay, I got it, I got it.

148
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:47,006
Yeah, there's no downstairs, okay, you know that.

149
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,548
Alright, so I'm bad actor, I know it.

150
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:54,715
This here is a ticket from the first Blue Jay game

151
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:59,039
in history in 1977, right, and that was the,

152
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,917
I remember that year was so awesome for Canadians

153
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:05,681
because Star Wars came out and Toronto got a baseball team.

154
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:06,581
Right?

155
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,178
1977.

156
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,555
And back then tickets were really, really big

157
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,229
and they weren't very environmentally friendly

158
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,230
because that wastes a lot of paper, right?

159
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,209
But now, obviously, I'm totally kidding, totally kidding.

160
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,370
But what I could do is I could talk about something

161
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,757
sentimental and if I'm presenting in Toronto, you know,

162
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:26,689
I can talk about, I can talk about this.

163
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:29,261
And, you know, if it's a marketing convention,

164
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:33,255
I can tie it into brand awareness and sentimental value

165
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:34,927
and that sort of thing.

166
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,804
I'm kind of tired because I had to

167
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,396
carry this thing from downstairs.

168
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,825
Okay, alright.

169
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,908
What else do I have here?

170
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,745
Oh, here's one here.

171
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,318
Networking is very important, very important.

172
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:56,647
It's, I found that by leveraging my background,

173
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,119
and you can do the same thing too,

174
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,899
I was able to get meetings with some very successful people,

175
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,329
people that will be much more successful

176
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,794
than I ever will be.

177
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,301
An example is this.

178
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:10,782
You know, my mom is Lebanese, here maiden name is Hadad,

179
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,047
and a buddy of mine that works for Morgan Stanley

180
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:17,232
in New York introduced me to the CEO of New York,

181
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:20,368
a guy named, a guy named John Mack.

182
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:23,715
And he's Lebanese as well and, you know, I told him

183
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:27,184
I'm part Lebanese and I established a great relationship

184
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:29,395
with the guy just based on talking about

185
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,913
what we have in common.

186
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:33,401
And it was so cool because I met with him on a Thursday

187
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,817
and I flew back from New York to San Francisco

188
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:38,627
and by the time I got back, this was sitting on my desk.

189
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,951
Alright, it was a book from him on the Lebanese.

190
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,380
Pretty cool, pretty cool.

191
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,213
Alright.

192
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:46,871
And so the bottom line here is please make sure to network.

193
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:49,403
Network with as many people as you can, yada, yada,

194
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,261
you get the idea.

195
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,508
I'm winging it here, okay?

196
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,841
Alright, here's another one.

197
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:02,537
I had the opportunity to meet Jimmy Carter, right,

198
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,026
along with many, many other people.

199
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:09,193
He was signing books at my MBA school and I lined up, right,

200
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:14,656
and I got this book from him and he signed it as well.

201
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,981
And, you know, this is, it's important to me.

202
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,149
I thought he was a really good guy, right,

203
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:23,601
and he has such an incredibly positive attitude.

204
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:27,150
But what blew me away about Jimmy Carter was that

205
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,146
there was a guy standing in line, you know, right before me,

206
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:34,130
right, and he got to the front of the line and he approached

207
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,664
Jimmy Carter and the Secret Service men were looking like

208
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:39,028
this, you know, everywhere, whatever, that's what they do.

209
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,782
Are they listening to music or something, I don't know.

210
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:41,804
Just kidding.

211
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:46,415
And so this guy asked Jimmy Carter to help him

212
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:48,918
in his home country, right,

213
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:53,085
with helping to stop civil unrest in a certain region.

214
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,778
And rather than Jimmy Carter just pushing him aside

215
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,349
he talked to him for a while, right, and I didn't care,

216
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:04,412
I was waiting, I was enjoying just hearing about it, right?

217
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:07,720
And he actually set up a meeting between this man

218
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,900
and himself later on that day to help him with the problems

219
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,486
in his country.

220
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,274
And Jimmy Carter was so incredibly genuine, right?

221
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,559
And that's probably one of the reasons he became President.

222
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,195
I mean, he was only a one-term President,

223
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,640
but he's just real and very trustworthy and just

224
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,843
salt of the Earth type of guy.

225
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:27,333
So, you know, I learned from here, from him,

226
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,910
the importance of strength and sincerity, okay?

227
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,239
Okay, I'm gonna keep going here.

228
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,994
And, again, you can just skip the rest of this

229
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:37,401
if you get the idea, okay?

230
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:39,821
We're talking about props.

231
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:40,654
Okay.

232
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,327
This is from my son, okay?

233
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:52,481
Alright, that's him, Dylan, and that's me, Dad, right?

234
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,928
Because I'm taller than him because he's a kid, right?

235
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:57,700
And he gave this to me on Father's Day and it touched

236
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,168
my heart so much that a lot of you might have noticed,

237
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:04,751
I'm making this up, that I actually skipped

238
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,532
our last conference.

239
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:11,252
And the reason I did was because Dylan gave this to me

240
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:12,252
and he said,

241
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,642
Dad, you missed my last,

242
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,871
actually, this part is true,

243
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:19,621
you missed my last Daddy and son,

244
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,685
or child, day at school.

245
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:24,786
You go into school, right?

246
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:26,008
It's true, I did miss it.

247
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:28,297
He goes, can you make sure you never miss one again?

248
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,255
And I said, of course, and I went with him in.

249
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,878
The weird thing is, when I miss Dylan/Daddy day at school,

250
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,779
right, which is once a year,

251
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,614
I don't remember why I missed it.

252
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,989
It was something, obviously, work related but I don't

253
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:42,072
remember why I missed it.

254
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,480
Of course, I remember skipping his events,

255
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,356
which is selfish of me, but I don't remember

256
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,866
what I did at work.

257
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,707
What could possibly have been more important

258
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:52,290
than spending time with my son?

259
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,356
Nothing, nothing.

260
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:55,189
Okay.

261
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:56,642
Alright.

262
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,849
What else do I have here?

263
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:01,059
Here's another one.

264
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,199
This is one of the best business books ever written, okay?

265
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,681
It's called The Intelligent Investor and it's written by

266
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,458
a guy named Benjamin Graham.

267
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:13,625
And Warren Buffet went to Columbia University only because

268
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:18,714
Benjamin Graham taught at that university, right?

269
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:21,488
And Warren Buffet and I have one thing in common,

270
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:25,071
we both got rejected by Harvard Business School, HBS,

271
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,764
2/3 of which is BS, and yes, you can quote me on that.

272
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,654
Thank you, right?

273
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,169
Okay.

274
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:34,112
Anyway, so I read this book, I marked it up a lot.

275
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:38,349
And Mr. Buffet came in and he presented to us, right?

276
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:42,391
And he was there with his late wife at the time.

277
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:44,795
This was back in, I think it was 1999 when he presented,

278
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,340
right, just a guest speaker.

279
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,624
And he actually said that he brought this book

280
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:52,786
on his honeymoon, right?

281
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:54,339
This is what he read on his honeymoon

282
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,214
and it changed his life.

283
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:58,296
And, the bottom line here is that

284
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:01,477
if you're a value investor, you're very long-term focused,

285
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:04,416
right, and Warren Buffet said something that blew my mind.

286
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,153
He said, you know, the longer the view,

287
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,945
the wiser the intention, right?

288
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:12,009
So, anyway, I brought this and I should have got him

289
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,807
to sign it, kind of like I did Jimmy Carter.

290
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:14,640
What was I thinking?

291
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,766
He was right there in front of me.

292
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,967
I mean there was a gazillion other people there but,

293
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,520
anyway, it is what it is.

294
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,353
Okay.

295
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,978
Oh yeah, this one, I remember this, okay.

296
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:29,711
This here is a movie called Keeping the Faith, right?

297
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,259
It was only okay.

298
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,558
It was with Edward Norton and Ben Stiller, who's a good guy.

299
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,868
And I'll never forget this.

300
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:40,238
I was in New York City with my buddy, Rich Madozow,

301
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,544
and we were in business school then,

302
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:44,812
and we walked home from a bar at 2:00 in the morning

303
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:46,775
and we might have, maybe, had too much to drink,

304
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:48,021
I don't know.

305
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:51,125
And we walked in to some bar that was closed, right,

306
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,493
in New York the bars closed earlier then I think,

307
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:56,927
and we sat down and we're surprised it was still open

308
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,270
and the bartender was cool

309
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,860
and gave us a couple of beers, right?

310
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,497
I think I had a Molsen Canadian or something,

311
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:03,085
'cause represent.

312
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:07,524
And all of a sudden, Ed Norton walked in and so did

313
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,581
Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman.

314
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:13,722
And a bunch of other people walked in as well, right?

315
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,742
I was like, what the hell is going on,

316
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,659
there's like 40 or 50 people here.

317
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:20,721
And Ben Stiller sat down beside me and he said to me,

318
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,088
he said to me, it was the coolest thing, Ben Stiller.

319
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:26,838
He said, can you believe we're still filming?

320
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,341
I didn't know what to say so I said this, right?

321
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:34,283
And you can verify because I'm in this movie, I said this,

322
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:38,247
I said, I know, I just want to go home, I'm tired.

323
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,119
And he was like, yeah, you and me both, right?

324
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,382
And so what happened was the Director, right,

325
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,543
I think it was Edward Norton I think was directing

326
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:47,822
at the time, right, he walked in the bar

327
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,171
and he pointed at my friend and I and said,

328
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:51,907
you and you, and I was like, God damn it, we're busted.

329
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:52,764
Right?

330
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:54,677
He said, you and you, you're the lead extras

331
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,365
in the next scene, right?

332
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,032
And I was like, yes!

333
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:02,526
And so, what happened was there's a scene here in

334
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,007
Keeping the Faith where their coming out of a restaurant

335
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,817
called Carmine's on the Upper West Side of New York City.

336
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,733
And they did about eight or nine takes.

337
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,956
And I walked holding this woman's hand into the bar

338
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:15,852
behind these three people and I ordered a drink.

339
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:18,503
So, anyway, that's me taking a risk in my life

340
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:21,363
and I believe in taking risks, whatever.

341
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,361
Keeping the Faith, true story, pretty funny.

342
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,194
Anyway.

343
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:28,288
I never got paid for that movie either.

344
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:30,692
But I think that's, that's, that's it.

345
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:33,715
Yeah, that's all I got, that's all I got, okay?

346
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:37,555
And so, you know, the bottom line is just, you know,

347
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:41,055
try to, when you bring in an item, a prop,

348
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,863
just make sure that it ties into

349
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:46,245
why you're speaking to them.

350
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,430
Make sure it's relevant.

351
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,548
In some of the examples I gave you,

352
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,736
it was somewhat relevant.

353
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,265
I kind of made up a, you know, a reason why it was relevant.

354
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,160
But make sure it's relevant at all times, right?

355
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,032
It's, I guess just to end it, end it off here,

356
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:02,595
I want you to watch, there's a George Clooney movie,

357
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,819
right, and he did an amazing job of discussing a backpack

358
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:10,486
as a prop in his movie called Up in the Air,

359
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,336
I think was the name, right?

360
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:15,253
And how much does your life weigh

361
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:17,257
and what's in your backpack?

362
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:21,094
So, check out this video as a way to wrap up this lecture

363
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,872
on bringing props to your speeches,

364
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:25,390
as a way to start your speech.
