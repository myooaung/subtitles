00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.311
Congratulations, you've made it!

2
00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:05.393
I've got something for you, hold on a sec,

3
00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:07.983
I'm not gonna go into my elevator this time.

4
00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:10.291
I don't have an elevator so no.

5
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.124
This is for you, okay?

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.530
Wow!

7
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.847
Oh my God, it's amazing!

8
00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:17.983
You wanna see it?

9
00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:18.846
You sure?

10
00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:20.179
Right, here we go.

11
00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.012
I've got an award for you.

12
00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:26.061
Okay?

13
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:27.228
It's an Oscar.

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.606
Okay so...

15
00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.989
(orchestral music)

16
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.365
This is an Oscar, this is for you.

17
00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:37.086
You're now better prepared for your speech

18
00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:39.642
and your presentation or your public speaking engagement

19
00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.809
than literally anybody you know.

20
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.206
Okay, this is very true

21
00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:47.370
and this should give you the confidence to know

22
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.860
that you're gonna do exceptionally well

23
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.782
on your big day and you're gonna enjoy,

24
00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:51.763
you're gonna have a lot of fun,

25
00:00:51.763 --> 00:00:53.388
you're gonna be relaxed, okay?

26
00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:54.311
You're gonna have a blast

27
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:58.114
and never ever again will you not like public speaking,

28
00:00:58.114 --> 00:00:59.663
okay?

29
00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.479
I just wanna thank you very much

30
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.074
for sticking with me through this entire course.

31
00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:07.676
I know it was long and I hope you learned a lot

32
00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:09.258
and I hope you enjoyed as well

33
00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:12.199
and I hope going forward, you love public speaking.

34
00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:14.368
This is an Oscar, right?

35
00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:16.105
It's on this Oscar, I wanna show it to you.

36
00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:18.218
I thought this would be kind of cool.

37
00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:21.577
I don't know if you can see that but there's five circles.

38
00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:25.378
These five little circle canisters, you see it right here?

39
00:01:25.378 --> 00:01:28.045
And these five circle canisters,

40
00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.477
they symbolize directing, producing, writing,

41
00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:36.693
the technical side of movies and acting, right?

42
00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:40.860
Which represents the five original branches of the Academy.

43
00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:44.734
This Oscar replica, right?

44
00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.831
Is 3.85 kilograms,

45
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:51.489
which is eight and a half pounds, right?

46
00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.274
It's 34 centimeters tall

47
00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:56.695
which is 13.5 inches

48
00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:59.956
and this one's pretty heavy.(groans)

49
00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:02.719
This one's, it's not gold plated though.

50
00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.552
Again, it's a replica.

51
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:10.208
Putting together your presentation was a huge effort.

52
00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:14.428
You also have to write, produce, direct, act

53
00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:17.857
and put together the technical aspects of your presentation,

54
00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:19.607
just like the Oscars.

55
00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:23.312
Anyway, I'm very, very, very happy that you're done

56
00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:24.812
the course, right?

57
00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:28.609
I wanted to give you just a quick recap.

58
00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.251
So, here's what we're gonna do.

59
00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:33.404
I'm gonna give you a recap of all 12 acts

60
00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:37.154
in a 140 characters or less so let's do this.

61
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.970
I'll kick it off with a recap of act one.

62
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.539
If we understand who our target audience or customer is,

63
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.498
we can ensure that we discuss relevant topics

64
00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:50.619
that can also appeal to emotions.

65
00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.414
Moving on to act two recap.

66
00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:55.781
If we begin with the end goal in mind,

67
00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:57.591
goal, Gretzky represent.

68
00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.453
If we begin with the end goal in mind,

69
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.253
we can nail the purpose of the speech

70
00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:03.378
and hit other goals like impressing those

71
00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:05.665
that can promote us.

72
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:07.877
In terms of act three recap,

73
00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:10.793
remember, the content rules, C-A-P.

74
00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:12.376
Cider is C.

75
00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:13.209
A is audience.

76
00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.913
P is purpose, okay?

77
00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:18.476
Now, cider remember, C stands for convincing,

78
00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:22.088
I is interesting, D is different, E is educational

79
00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:23.923
R is relevant.

80
00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:27.465
Alright, next up we have, act four recap.

81
00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:30.524
We talked about more than 10 different presentation

82
00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:32.771
and image applications.

83
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:36.999
We also talked about PIMCO, P-I-M-C-O for slide rules.

84
00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.025
PIMCO in our case stands for pictures, inspiration,

85
00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:44.442
minimalism, consistent and original.

86
00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:46.524
(upbeat music)

87
00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:50.691
Next up, we have act five where we dealt with confidence

88
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:55.629
and we discussed turning on the confidence switch.

89
00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.494
Elite athletes like Bob Gibson.

90
00:03:58.494 --> 00:04:00.312
We also talked about Warren Buffett

91
00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:02.961
and whether or not you think you can achieve something,

92
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:03.932
you're right.

93
00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:06.164
(upbeat music)

94
00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:10.303
In terms of act six, we talked about the medium

95
00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:12.579
being more important than the message.

96
00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.996
Deliver with passion, move around, pause,

97
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.898
change your tone, use your hands and your eyes.

98
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.500
In terms of act number seven,

99
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.009
during the Q&A session, using transition words

100
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.477
and frameworks can buy you time

101
00:04:31.477 --> 00:04:35.831
and help you more logically answer questions.

102
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:38.248
Next up we have act number eight.

103
00:04:38.248 --> 00:04:40.956
We discussed how to practice your speech

104
00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:44.663
in distracting environments and exactly what to do

105
00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:48.496
in the days or weeks before in the morning of.

106
00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:53.493
Moving on to act number nine,

107
00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:57.781
we discussed appearance secrets of newscasters

108
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:02.080
what to eat and getting into an optimal state of mind

109
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.342
so we can make a great first impression.

110
00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:05.964
(upbeat music)

111
00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:09.131
Next up, we have act 10.

112
00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.808
After the speech is done,

113
00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:15.972
we need to make sure we accomplished the speech's purpose

114
00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:18.034
from act number two.

115
00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:22.306
Follow up ASAP, ask for the sale et cetera, thanks.

116
00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:23.976
(upbeat music)

117
00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:27.193
In act number 11, those of you that watched all

118
00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:31.360
of the first intermission, you'll remember this one.

119
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.647
Act 11 recap, included are 25 guide books

120
00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:40.426
and 50 templates that's two per type of presentation

121
00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:44.593
and the intent is to help you work smarter and not harder.

122
00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:58.544
You're still here?

123
00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:02.497
It's over.

124
00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:05.167
Go home.

125
00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:09.680
Go!

126
00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:20.068
Just kidding.

127
00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:23.197
I saved the best for last here, the hat.

128
00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:26.060
In act number 12, in this section,

129
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.657
there's additional resources, including quotes

130
00:06:28.657 --> 00:06:32.238
and other items and if you want me to add

131
00:06:32.238 --> 00:06:36.045
any more items please let me know, thank you.

132
00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.834
I just wanna finish it off by sincerely thanking you.

133
00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:42.903
I really, really hope you enjoyed this.

134
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.060
Your speech has the opportunity to change

135
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.846
and improve the life of many people around

136
00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:50.267
you including your own, of course.

137
00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:53.864
There's really no limits to what you can achieve.

138
00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:57.094
I just wanna say that, you know, one speech

139
00:06:57.094 --> 00:07:01.132
can really change the world if given the right way

140
00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:03.781
and I believe you can do it armed with these skills

141
00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:05.448
that you've learned.

142
00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.396
If you have any questions about this course,

143
00:07:08.396 --> 00:07:10.455
I'm sorry I'm rambling here but its kind of,

144
00:07:10.455 --> 00:07:11.396
bit emotional for me,

145
00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:14.120
I've worked hard on this.

146
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.697
Just let me know.

147
00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:17.940
I really believe that life all comes down

148
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.509
to a few short moments and thank you very much

149
00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:25.387
