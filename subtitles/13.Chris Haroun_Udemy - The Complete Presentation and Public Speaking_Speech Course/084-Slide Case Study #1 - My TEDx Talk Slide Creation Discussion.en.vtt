00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.398
Let's talk about how I made the

2
00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:04.184
slides for my TEDx presentation,

3
00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:07.636
I use primarily PowerPoint and the version on the Mac

4
00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:09.720
here is similar to the version on Windows.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.360
I actually created this using both the Windows

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.083
and the Mac version of PowerPoint, they're similar.

7
00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.917
But before I get started,

8
00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.019
I want to show you one quick thing.

9
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.061
So if we go to view here.

10
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:24.120
And then we go to the notes page.

11
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.233
Because I had to memorize this 15 minute speech, right?

12
00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.483
And there's a lot of complex clicks for transitions.

13
00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:32.621
I actually wrote all my notes just to practice,

14
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:34.436
I certainly didn't read these the day of.

15
00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:35.269
Okay, so.

16
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.287
If we click here to the next notes page,

17
00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:42.611
you'll see that this is just

18
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:44.010
what I have to say on each slide.

19
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.843
Okay?

20
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.287
You can go back to the first intermission if you want

21
00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:49.910
to watch me critique

22
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.051
and watch the whole video of the TEDx talk.

23
00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.731
Okay, so I'm gonna click here quickly.

24
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.272
Each slide and you'll see here

25
00:00:57.272 --> 00:00:59.549
are all the items I had to memorize.

26
00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.611
And again, I had a lot of transitions here.

27
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.411
And a lot of animations.

28
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.965
And so I had to really practice this one a lot.

29
00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.954
All right, cool, so I think you get the idea.

30
00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:12.190
Great.

31
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.990
And you can look at this,

32
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.735
it's in the file that I'm providing you.

33
00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:21.374
But I provided you the file in Dropbox format.

34
00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:22.937
As a link,

35
00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.531
only because it's three or four hundred megabytes,

36
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:26.872
a massive file.

37
00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:28.552
Okay, I digress.

38
00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:31.112
Let's go back here to,

39
00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:31.945
normal.

40
00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:36.654
Okay, it's very graphics intensive as you can see.

41
00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:37.487
Okay, so.

42
00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:40.675
I want to first of all talk about transitions.

43
00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:43.656
Most of the transitions I did from one slide to the next,

44
00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:45.575
were either fade,

45
00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:48.792
which just kind of fades from one slide to the next.

46
00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:51.134
Or I used nothing, or I used morph.

47
00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:53.075
Which is very, very powerful.

48
00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:57.214
And a keynote, they refer to that as magic move.

49
00:01:57.214 --> 00:02:00.948
If you're interested in how to do magic move for keynote,

50
00:02:00.948 --> 00:02:03.731
just go back to act four, scene one.

51
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.350
and then it was the fourth lecture,

52
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.352
where I described how I created a keynote presentation.

53
00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:10.531
Okay, cool.

54
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:11.694
So,

55
00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:13.111
when it comes to,

56
00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.070
special fonts like this.

57
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.706
Just watch scene two of act four

58
00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.510
and you'll see how I made these.

59
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.696
It was using Final Cut Pro.

60
00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:26.616
Which is a free download for 30 days

61
00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:28.296
and it's available in many languages.

62
00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:30.211
You don't have to make fonts like that, though.

63
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.291
Let me go through this quickly.

64
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:35.635
All right, so I used morph a heck of a lot here.

65
00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:39.802
In the past, people would use very complex animations.

66
00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:47.091
And they'd insert different paths for items to move.

67
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:48.629
And that sort of thing.

68
00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.408
And I have some of that in here,

69
00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:53.251
but in interest of time and simplicity,

70
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.294
I just want you to use the morph feature.

71
00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:58.595
To get morph basically moves one,

72
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:02.611
it moves one item from one slide to the next.

73
00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.091
Let me just start a new file very quickly here.

74
00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:06.819
And right click.

75
00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.318
Microsoft always anticipates

76
00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:09.678
when you try to do a right click.

77
00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:12.238
And I'm gonna paste that heart there.

78
00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:16.405
And then if I wanted to have that heart get resized here.

79
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:20.419
Then what you'd do is you would

80
00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.739
go here to transitions, morph.

81
00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.976
And then when you click play, watch this.

82
00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:28.035
Next slide, boom.

83
00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:29.336
Big heart, that's it.

84
00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:30.169
Great.

85
00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:35.275
So that's the morph feature that I use quite a bit here.

86
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:38.692
You'll see from this slide to this slide,

87
00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.216
I actually just morph that edge.

88
00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:44.638
Because I morphed it there

89
00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:48.296
and I'll show you what it looks like.

90
00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:51.038
Okay, let me go up a slide.

91
00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:52.094
Here you go.

92
00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:54.435
So you'll see that it's gonna fly in.

93
00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:56.374
And all I did,

94
00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:57.955
close that out.

95
00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:01.176
All I did was I actually hid this little

96
00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:04.334
graphic on the previous slide somewhere else.

97
00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:05.852
I'll show you, let me zoom out.

98
00:04:05.852 --> 00:04:06.685
Okay.

99
00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:08.616
See it there?

100
00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:10.014
It's actually hidden.

101
00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:12.136
And then it just zooms right in,

102
00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:13.555
when I transition to the next slide.

103
00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.055
It goes from here,

104
00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:18.355
directly to here and again when it comes to images,

105
00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:20.435
I'm not gonna talk about how I made images here,

106
00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.435
because I already talked about it at length.

107
00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:24.914
In scene two of act four.

108
00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:26.612
All right, so that's morphing.

109
00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:28.056
And I did that quite a bit.

110
00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:31.723
So for the England flag icon, I had it here.

111
00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:37.832
And then here it just transitioned

112
00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:40.094
or morphed from one side to the next.

113
00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:41.927
Let's resize this now.

114
00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.814
And let's keep going down through here.

115
00:04:44.814 --> 00:04:47.774
These are just morphs, so for the Chinese flag,

116
00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:49.512
I just morphed it, as well.

117
00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:52.142
And the same thing with this down here.

118
00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:53.283
See how it moved there?

119
00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:58.209
So the Chinese flag should move from there to there.

120
00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.259
Let's see how that worked.

121
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.176
Click play.

122
00:05:04.782 --> 00:05:08.040
There you go, isn't that cool?

123
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.982
So all I did was I morphed there.

124
00:05:09.982 --> 00:05:11.539
So it's just from one slide to the next.

125
00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.619
You click morph,

126
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:15.443
and then it just moves there around.

127
00:05:15.443 --> 00:05:17.978
Morph is very powerful, please don't get bogged down

128
00:05:17.978 --> 00:05:22.179
with creating animations and customized paths.

129
00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:24.259
Because morph is just a lot easier to do.

130
00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.942
Just play around with this presentation if you have time

131
00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:30.083
and you'll see how simplistic it is.

132
00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:32.739
I'm trying to help you work smarter and harder.

133
00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:34.302
And so for this slide,

134
00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:36.723
what I did was I zoomed in.

135
00:05:36.723 --> 00:05:37.890
I'll show you.

136
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.643
I zoomed into that black coffee cup on the right side there.

137
00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:48.403
TEA, Technology, Education and Acceptance.

138
00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:50.916
It's very graphics intensive.

139
00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:52.243
So if you try it on your computer,

140
00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:53.859
it might be a little bit slow.

141
00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:56.600
Make sure all your other programs are closed.

142
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.779
All that you're seeing there,

143
00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.946
is just a transition, see?

144
00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:04.619
Using morph.

145
00:06:06.062 --> 00:06:07.395
So if I go here.

146
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.739
Here we go.

147
00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:12.062
So it's just morph.

148
00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:14.083
And I just took an image and morphed it closer.

149
00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.923
And the cool thing is you can actually morph

150
00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:17.673
with letters as well.

151
00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:20.792
It can morph as characters.

152
00:06:22.242 --> 00:06:24.782
Basically, what would happen is if

153
00:06:24.782 --> 00:06:26.958
those were the two same text files.

154
00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.936
Let me actually go here and show you from scratch,

155
00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:31.304
cause it's pretty cool, it's worth checking out.

156
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:33.646
Okay, let me do a new slide.

157
00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:37.646
What we're gonna do, is we're gonna morph words.

158
00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:40.456
Words are here.

159
00:06:42.323 --> 00:06:44.782
I'm gonna copy and paste this here.

160
00:06:44.782 --> 00:06:46.032
Words are here.

161
00:06:48.722 --> 00:06:50.104
There.

162
00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:51.166
So watch this.

163
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:52.963
So when I go to morph here.

164
00:06:52.963 --> 00:06:54.446
You go to transitions.

165
00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:55.864
Morph.

166
00:06:55.864 --> 00:06:57.944
And then you have to select here words.

167
00:06:57.944 --> 00:06:59.111
So watch this.

168
00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:04.104
There you go, see?

169
00:07:04.104 --> 00:07:07.166
It moved that T over, it morphed just for that one.

170
00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.627
Let me show you again.

171
00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:10.165
So I'll click preview.

172
00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:11.646
Words are there.

173
00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:13.322
Isn't that wild?

174
00:07:13.322 --> 00:07:15.464
And you can even make it more complex.

175
00:07:15.464 --> 00:07:16.926
If you wanted to, we can,

176
00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:20.184
kind of have a couple words here

177
00:07:20.184 --> 00:07:23.966
that have W in it and other similar letters.

178
00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:26.883
If I were to create gibberish here.

179
00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:32.664
Words rea threee, that's not even a word.

180
00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:34.648
Let's just check it out for simplicity.

181
00:07:34.648 --> 00:07:36.606
See how it moves it, isn't that wild?

182
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.046
Very cool.

183
00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.126
Okay, that's the morph feature, very powerful.

184
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.587
Use it, I love it, please.

185
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.347
Okay, great.

186
00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:45.048
Let's see what we have next.

187
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.401
And what I had to do, is I actually had to,

188
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.605
enlarge each of these images,

189
00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:51.641
make it bigger, bigger, bigger.

190
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:53.907
so that it looked like I was zooming in,

191
00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:55.886
but all I was using was the morph feature.

192
00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:58.526
It's pretty easy, it's fun, too.

193
00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:00.088
Let me zoom out a bit here.

194
00:08:00.088 --> 00:08:04.824
In this transition here, let me show you what I tried to do.

195
00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:07.928
I wanted to show you a three legged stool.

196
00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:11.048
And then I wanted to show you how you can have it,

197
00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:12.744
pointing to the future.

198
00:08:12.744 --> 00:08:14.282
Watch this, see those three there?

199
00:08:14.282 --> 00:08:16.446
And I changed the image for each,

200
00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:18.279
to change the shading.

201
00:08:21.187 --> 00:08:23.354
So I made it a bit darker.

202
00:08:25.107 --> 00:08:28.446
Made it darker again, again it's pretty slow.

203
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:29.696
And then there.

204
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.452
And then,

205
00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:34.362
you see that?

206
00:08:34.362 --> 00:08:38.362
I want to show you how I changed the image here.

207
00:08:39.437 --> 00:08:40.836
So what you do,

208
00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:43.235
is you go to picture format.

209
00:08:43.235 --> 00:08:44.902
It's the same image.

210
00:08:46.282 --> 00:08:47.882
And I reset it.

211
00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:49.018
See here, watch this.

212
00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:50.351
Reset the image.

213
00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:56.225
And then what I can do is I can go to artistic effects.

214
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.242
And I go down to this one.

215
00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:00.442
See? Pretty cool.

216
00:09:00.442 --> 00:09:02.100
All right, I'm not gonna talk too much about how

217
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.898
to make color images because we did

218
00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:06.398
that in scene two of act four.

219
00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:10.020
Great, control Z.

220
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.779
And then what I wanted to do is I want

221
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:15.112
to show you how the root of my argument,

222
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.037
is if you have technology, education, acceptance,

223
00:09:24.037 --> 00:09:26.644
you can actually fix the world.

224
00:09:26.644 --> 00:09:29.487
And the root of that is actually used using cloud computing

225
00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:32.383
so it's kind of cute whenever I try to zoom in here.

226
00:09:32.383 --> 00:09:35.583
And all I did actually was I just moved the image.

227
00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:36.804
From one side to the next.

228
00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:38.682
And then just did morph.

229
00:09:38.682 --> 00:09:40.388
It was really, really simplistic.

230
00:09:40.388 --> 00:09:41.786
So let me show you how that works.

231
00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:44.242
Again, it's pretty graphics intensive.

232
00:09:44.242 --> 00:09:47.258
All right, so we click here to the next slide.

233
00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:48.975
You see that, so I moved those around.

234
00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:50.392
Just using morph.

235
00:09:51.575 --> 00:09:52.879
And I click there.

236
00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:54.399
Isn't that cool?

237
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.316
Next slide.

238
00:09:57.119 --> 00:09:58.463
Move those around.

239
00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.239
Using morph.

240
00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:02.922
Very powerful and the image in the background

241
00:10:02.922 --> 00:10:05.567
we already talked about how to manipulate that.

242
00:10:05.567 --> 00:10:07.124
Amazon web services and then when

243
00:10:07.124 --> 00:10:08.724
you click to the next slide.

244
00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:10.324
All that is there is,

245
00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:11.580
you can just morph it.

246
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.866
Pretty simple, pretty simple.

247
00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:15.386
That's it.

248
00:10:15.386 --> 00:10:16.969
You see these here?

249
00:10:18.148 --> 00:10:20.047
These are just my notes, don't worry about it.

250
00:10:20.047 --> 00:10:24.388
So all I did was I took these icons here, these images.

251
00:10:24.388 --> 00:10:26.964
And I just grabbed a bunch from the web

252
00:10:26.964 --> 00:10:28.484
and I altered them again.

253
00:10:28.484 --> 00:10:30.426
Go to act four, scene two if you want

254
00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:32.527
to see how I manipulate images.

255
00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:34.161
And I just kind of moved them around.

256
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:35.680
And then it morphs.

257
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.847
And whenever you see new items on a slide here for me,

258
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.684
like these ones here,

259
00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:46.026
it's because I want to morph them.

260
00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:47.526
In the next slide.

261
00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:49.706
So if you see here,

262
00:10:49.706 --> 00:10:51.863
what we're focused on, is here.

263
00:10:51.863 --> 00:10:54.320
This isn't even in the picture yet,

264
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.148
but it will be in the next slide.

265
00:10:56.148 --> 00:10:57.146
Watch this.

266
00:10:57.146 --> 00:10:57.979
See?

267
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.120
All I did was I moved those items down.

268
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.564
And it morphed there.

269
00:11:02.564 --> 00:11:04.106
It's pretty powerful stuff.

270
00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:08.273
And then for this one, I actually did the same thing.

271
00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:11.914
If we just hide this.

272
00:11:13.146 --> 00:11:14.896
Let me zoom in a bit.

273
00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:17.860
So this here is,

274
00:11:19.507 --> 00:11:23.403
my Back to the Future flex capacitor I think it's called.

275
00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:25.748
I love the eighties and then Ferris Bueller,

276
00:11:25.748 --> 00:11:27.327
please watch that movie it's awesome.

277
00:11:27.327 --> 00:11:30.367
And then all I did there was I just zoomed in.

278
00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:31.828
Using morph.

279
00:11:31.828 --> 00:11:33.911
It was pretty simplistic.

280
00:11:35.167 --> 00:11:37.386
Pretty neat, pretty fun.

281
00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:41.626
And play around with these a lot, if you want to.

282
00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:42.959
Picture formats.

283
00:11:44.064 --> 00:11:47.360
And I used animations in some parts.

284
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.904
And you can click on animation pane if you want

285
00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:51.541
and it would show you all the animations.

286
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:53.221
but I don't want you to do that.

287
00:11:53.221 --> 00:11:57.388
I just want you to use the more simplistic morphing feature.

288
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.080
And here, you can't see the image,

289
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.602
cause I zoomed way out and sometimes it doesn't show up,

290
00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:08.178
it's kind of an issue with PowerPoint.

291
00:12:08.178 --> 00:12:10.682
I love it, so I'm not gonna complain about PowerPoint,

292
00:12:10.682 --> 00:12:11.722
it's a pretty good app.

293
00:12:11.722 --> 00:12:14.042
So I just put a cloud on top of here.

294
00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:16.144
It's really far away.

295
00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:19.783
And then what I did was I zoomed in and these items here,

296
00:12:19.783 --> 00:12:21.084
see how it disappeared?

297
00:12:21.084 --> 00:12:23.248
They actually went onto the olive branch.

298
00:12:23.248 --> 00:12:25.104
And I'll show you how that worked out,

299
00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:26.961
again because it's so graphics intensive

300
00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:28.384
sometimes it doesn't show up.

301
00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:29.634
So I went here.

302
00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:33.285
And I was kind of saying, "Hey, Washington and the world,

303
00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:35.488
governments please fix education."

304
00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.109
see?

305
00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:38.565
Isn't that cool?

306
00:12:38.565 --> 00:12:40.506
And I transitioned there.

307
00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:42.848
And then for this one here,

308
00:12:42.848 --> 00:12:46.325
I was saying, "come on, governments pay for education."

309
00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:48.746
Fixes all problems in the world, et cetera.

310
00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:49.744
All I did,

311
00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:50.577
was,

312
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.413
I just used the morph.

313
00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:58.862
And again for images, go to act four, scene two

314
00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.906
and you'll see how I made them.

315
00:13:00.906 --> 00:13:03.104
And let me show you what that transition looked like.

316
00:13:03.104 --> 00:13:04.762
This one took me a while.

317
00:13:04.762 --> 00:13:07.066
And again, it's just morph.

318
00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:08.506
It's morph.

319
00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:10.144
Okay.

320
00:13:10.144 --> 00:13:11.061
Edtech now.

321
00:13:12.442 --> 00:13:16.609
Click the next slide, it's actually taking a while, you see?

322
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.490
And what you could just in case this happens to you

323
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.930
and it freezes like this,

324
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.189
is you can do a record of the screen using Quicktime,

325
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:28.629
which is available on Windows and Macs.

326
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:32.207
And just go to act four, scene three to see how I made,

327
00:13:32.207 --> 00:13:34.457
the videos using Quicktime.

328
00:13:36.488 --> 00:13:39.285
It goes from one slide to the next.

329
00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:40.832
And it actually,

330
00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:42.228
there's an issue there in the background,

331
00:13:42.228 --> 00:13:44.389
I'd have to fix that, but whatever.

332
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:47.050
So we have transitions from one slide

333
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.587
to the next using just morph.

334
00:13:49.587 --> 00:13:51.337
It's really powerful.

335
00:13:52.693 --> 00:13:54.512
It looks like I spent a lot

336
00:13:54.512 --> 00:13:56.853
of time using complex animation but I didn't.

337
00:13:56.853 --> 00:13:58.949
It's just the morph feature, which is awesome.

338
00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:03.032
And I fast forward to these screens quickly here.

339
00:14:06.197 --> 00:14:08.912
That's why morph didn't work, I went really, really fast.

340
00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:11.105
Okay, whatever, you get the idea.

341
00:14:11.105 --> 00:14:14.890
Okay for images here, these are just from Final Cut,

342
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.192
you don't have to use Final Cut,

343
00:14:16.192 --> 00:14:19.349
you can create these using other applications.

344
00:14:19.349 --> 00:14:22.090
Go to act four, scene two to check out how I did that.

345
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.688
Let me fast forward here.

346
00:14:24.688 --> 00:14:25.855
And this here,

347
00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:29.119
this was a lot of fun here.

348
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.444
So what I wanted to show here,

349
00:14:32.444 --> 00:14:36.671
is that a lot of people will use YouTube in the future

350
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:39.130
to change governments from within.

351
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.848
So if there's,

352
00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.906
issues where certain people don't have rights

353
00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:45.786
which is ridiculous in some countries,

354
00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.450
people will use YouTube to stand up

355
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.848
and change society from within.

356
00:14:48.848 --> 00:14:52.149
And it was kind of a political thing for me to say that.

357
00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:53.146
I shouldn't do that,

358
00:14:53.146 --> 00:14:55.226
but I basically said I don't believe in war.

359
00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:57.450
I think that you change society from within.

360
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.728
Okay, sorry, whatever, way off topic.

361
00:14:59.728 --> 00:15:02.656
So let me show you how that looks.

362
00:15:02.656 --> 00:15:04.140
So you go here,

363
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.202
and then when you click on the next slide,

364
00:15:06.202 --> 00:15:10.577
watch this, you'll see all the YouTube's right there.

365
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.077
To change society from within.

366
00:15:16.325 --> 00:15:17.925
This is a little bit off topic,

367
00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:19.104
but it's kind of important.

368
00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:22.746
I put the YouTube one here in the ocean at first,

369
00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:24.624
cause there's no countries right there.

370
00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:25.984
And I didn't want to make it look

371
00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:28.266
like I was singling out any country.

372
00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:31.306
Or criticizing anybody cause that's not what I do.

373
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:32.562
Okay.

374
00:15:32.562 --> 00:15:33.904
And then here,

375
00:15:33.904 --> 00:15:36.304
these are just images that I created

376
00:15:36.304 --> 00:15:38.282
and morphed from one to the next.

377
00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:40.165
And I was talking about,

378
00:15:40.165 --> 00:15:42.745
how everyone's got freedom to water,

379
00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:46.842
freedom to air, freedom to coexist religion wise, et cetera.

380
00:15:46.842 --> 00:15:48.325
And leads to transition.

381
00:15:48.325 --> 00:15:51.962
So I started with freedom water then freedom to air.

382
00:15:51.962 --> 00:15:54.026
And then here, freedom to coexist.

383
00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:55.402
You see there in the bottom?

384
00:15:55.402 --> 00:15:57.504
Coexist, that's just a bunch of religious images.

385
00:15:57.504 --> 00:16:01.706
Careful not to bring religion into your presentations.

386
00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:03.182
But it was important for me here to say

387
00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:05.205
we have freedom religion which is a beautiful thing.

388
00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:08.122
And I made this image using Image Chef.

389
00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:09.742
And you can just go to again,

390
00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:12.185
act four, scene two to see how I made images.

391
00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:14.504
And it's a website that I used that for,

392
00:16:14.504 --> 00:16:16.144
it's really easy to get.

393
00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:19.502
And then the top right hand corner,

394
00:16:19.502 --> 00:16:22.544
I showed how education's very important.

395
00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:25.285
And then I just transitioned here.

396
00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:26.702
Transition again.

397
00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:31.744
And I made those images with Final Cut,

398
00:16:31.744 --> 00:16:34.160
which I showed you in act four, scene two.

399
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.341
Again, Final Cut's a free download.

400
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:38.144
For 30 days, then you gotta pay for it.

401
00:16:38.144 --> 00:16:40.419
So just delete it if you don't wanna pay for it.

402
00:16:40.419 --> 00:16:41.586
And then here,

403
00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:44.704
I actually showed,

404
00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:46.000
transitions again.

405
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.939
You see how that transition didn't work there?

406
00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:51.939
I clicked the go ahead button too quickly there.

407
00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:56.320
There we go.

408
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.873
And here on the bottom,

409
00:16:57.873 --> 00:17:00.656
these are just images that I created.

410
00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:03.757
And I wanted to quote Nelson Mandela.

411
00:17:03.757 --> 00:17:05.600
"Education is the most important weapon,

412
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.676
we can use it to change the world."

413
00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:10.240
and if you want to see the delivery of that,

414
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.837
just go to the first intermission.

415
00:17:12.837 --> 00:17:13.754
Okay, here.

416
00:17:15.898 --> 00:17:19.231
That's where I talked about John Lennon.

417
00:17:20.357 --> 00:17:21.375
And then there,

418
00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:24.397
and again it's all morph, it's way easier than you think.

419
00:17:24.397 --> 00:17:25.520
That's my Jackie Chan quote.

420
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.603
He's awesome.

421
00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:30.176
That was my Chinese proverb.

422
00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:31.418
and then what I wanted to do,

423
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:34.138
was because i try to be consistent,

424
00:17:34.138 --> 00:17:36.721
I talked about how I made this,

425
00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.116
this slideshow and I wrote my text talk.

426
00:17:39.116 --> 00:17:43.196
Part of it, when I was stuck on a runway in Ireland.

427
00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.720
And the landscape was beautiful.

428
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.416
And look at that, pot of gold.

429
00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:47.877
This is gorgeous.

430
00:17:47.877 --> 00:17:49.418
And then what I did was,

431
00:17:49.418 --> 00:17:51.760
I transitioned to the next slide here,

432
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.760
with saying,

433
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:57.696
this here's an Irish blessing.

434
00:17:57.696 --> 00:17:59.494
And I actually read part of it,

435
00:17:59.494 --> 00:18:01.692
I had to look at it on the screen.

436
00:18:01.692 --> 00:18:03.856
I think I kind of forgot a bit to be honest.

437
00:18:03.856 --> 00:18:07.258
And then I just transitioned here to TEA.

438
00:18:07.258 --> 00:18:08.896
Can fix all problems.

439
00:18:08.896 --> 00:18:10.355
And at the end I thanked the crowd

440
00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:11.418
and that sort of thing.

441
00:18:11.418 --> 00:18:14.858
All these images, I used within the presentation.

442
00:18:14.858 --> 00:18:16.416
I thought it would be kind of a cool way

443
00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:17.974
to throw it all together there.

444
00:18:17.974 --> 00:18:19.717
And then I think if might've faded to black

445
00:18:19.717 --> 00:18:21.258
or just left it as is.

446
00:18:21.258 --> 00:18:23.557
And at the end of your presentations either fade to black

447
00:18:23.557 --> 00:18:25.936
or show your contact details.

448
00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:28.037
I actually didn't, I just went to end slideshow.

449
00:18:28.037 --> 00:18:29.338
Okay, so that is that,

450
00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:30.916
please let me know if you have any questions.

451
00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:33.616
That's probably the most complex PowerPoint will get.

452
00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:35.512
But again, just use the morph feature.

453
00:18:35.512 --> 00:18:37.274
It is so awesome.

454
00:18:37.274 --> 00:18:38.107
Thanks.
