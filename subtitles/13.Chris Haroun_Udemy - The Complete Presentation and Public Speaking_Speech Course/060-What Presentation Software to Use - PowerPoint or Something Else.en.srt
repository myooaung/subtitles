1
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:01,855
In this lecture

2
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:03,827
I'll discuss what software products to use,

3
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:05,727
meaning PowerPoint or something else

4
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:08,060
and please note that I created this lecture

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,489
using Keynote software,

6
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,910
which is only available on Apple products.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,325
In the next optional lecture I'll discuss

8
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,753
how I made this lecture but regardless

9
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:20,488
of what software you want to use

10
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,671
or what platform you're using,

11
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,385
meaning Apple or other platforms,

12
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,564
please watch this lecture as I want to expose you

13
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:30,020
to every type of major presentation software package

14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,687
I think makes sense to take a look at.

15
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:36,940
Okay, so I'm gonna cover every single platform.

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,768
The first one is PowerPoint

17
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:43,692
and PowerPoint is available on all these platforms.

18
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:47,859
PowerPoint is free if you use it on mobile or tablet devices

19
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:54,374
but you have to pay for it if you use it on a desktop,

20
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:58,124
meaning Apple computers or Windows computers.

21
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:02,040
Okay, next up, I want to tell you

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,371
this is my number one pick, PowerPoint,

23
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:06,033
and I know that's controversial

24
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,944
but the reason I say it is there's so many

25
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:09,611
advanced features that you can use,

26
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,262
and more importantly for me, personally,

27
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:15,150
I kind of grew up in a Windows environment

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,353
and I'm used to using all of these applications

29
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:21,520
you see right there, so I love it, but I also love Keynote.

30
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:26,375
Next up, we have my second favorite pick,

31
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,117
which is Keynote and I love it,

32
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:30,250
I almost love it more than PowerPoint now

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,016
and Keynote is not available on all platforms,

34
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:36,106
it's available on iOS as well as

35
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:39,562
Apple desktop or laptop products

36
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:42,055
and it's free, sort of, I mean, you have to buy

37
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:44,772
all the Apple products first and then it's free.

38
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,302
Okay, so it's my second favorite pick,

39
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:50,376
again, almost my favorite,

40
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,958
it's really easy to use,

41
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,093
there's not as many advanced features

42
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:58,426
as with PowerPoint but that's debatable.

43
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,330
Let's talk about some of the more advanced features

44
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,737
within Keynote, okay, and I'll just give you

45
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:07,225
a quick little demo here of what Keynote can do,

46
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:09,683
some of the advanced features, okay?

47
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,114
So if you wanted to insert a chart,

48
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:15,114
it's got really cool dynamic charts,

49
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,006
I don't think you can do this

50
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,006
to the same extent with PowerPoint,

51
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,655
look at that, how beautiful is that, right?

52
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,834
Typical Apple product.

53
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,051
Alright, there's also interactive charts here,

54
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:29,280
where you can show data trends over time,

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,162
it's pretty cool, pretty cool,

56
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,255
but with Microsoft it ties into Excel

57
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,656
a little bit more with PowerPoint, okay?

58
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,990
So there's benefits to being in different ecosystems.

59
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,230
Let's move on now to Google Slides,

60
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,235
which is free on all platforms, which is awesome

61
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:47,720
and if it wasn't free on all platforms

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,521
then I'm sure we would pay for Microsoft products

63
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:53,471
on all platforms, thank you Google.

64
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,949
It's my number three pick,

65
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,446
it's really, really simple to use

66
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:00,635
and there's tons of templates available online.

67
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:04,135
Okay, next up let's talk about Haiku Deck,

68
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,730
this one's not as popular, but it's pretty cool

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,491
and it works on all platforms because it's internet based

70
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,940
meaning you use a browser with it

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,784
and it's really nice if you want

72
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:20,025
to throw in beautiful pictures

73
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,031
and I believe that you should have more images

74
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:27,472
than you think you need in all of your presentations,

75
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:31,032
a picture is worth a thousand words.

76
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:32,862
So I'll give you a couple of examples here,

77
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:36,323
look how beautiful that is, isn't that gorgeous?

78
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:39,066
Stunning, and you can download a lot of these as well,

79
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,899
isn't that nice there?

80
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:43,718
Love it, love it.

81
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:51,596
Okay, happy love teaching week, how awesome is that?

82
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,543
Alright, next up we've got PowToon,

83
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:59,672
and this one is off the charts, I absolutely love it

84
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,237
and it's browser based as well,

85
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:03,636
which means you can use it on any platform you want

86
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:06,719
and if you're a student or a teacher,

87
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,138
you can use it for a much lower pricing point

88
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:14,305
and it's free, except if you want to get rid of the logo

89
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,744
when you publish the animations,

90
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:22,163
so let me just kinda show you examples

91
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:25,671
of how I've used this software in the past.

92
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:27,915
So I've used this to create animations

93
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:32,239
to explain complex stuff within some of my courses,

94
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,961
so in this case I was kinda talking about

95
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:36,903
what are the different financial analyst roles

96
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,729
and how do they all work together

97
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,773
and with those purple circle locks, if you pay

98
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,826
for the product, you can get more advanced features.

99
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,999
Separately, you can move your characters around,

100
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,749
you can replace them, swap them with different types

101
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,904
and you can also insert your own images,

102
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:59,071
objects here, music, et cetera, and it's a lot of fun to use

103
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,480
and my kids use it in school actually,

104
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,853
it's probably the best animation tool I know out there

105
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,770
for simplistic presentations, okay?

106
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,148
And then there's Prezi, and Prezi is free

107
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,581
but you have to pay for it if you want to get support

108
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,145
and more storage in the cloud

109
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:23,320
and because it's web based, this one is also available

110
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,920
on all major platforms, okay?

111
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,491
And I've used this one a lot within my courses,

112
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:32,283
and I'm gonna give you a couple of examples.

113
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:34,700
So the first example is here,

114
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:39,526
when I wanted to discuss what is the research process

115
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,982
for analyzing a stock in one of my courses

116
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:44,651
and basically the cool thing about Prezi,

117
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:48,501
is you can zoom in and zoom out, it's really, really neat,

118
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,051
it kind of reminds me of Google Earth,

119
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,401
where you can zoom into different parts of the world.

120
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,177
So there's an eight step process

121
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:57,852
to investing in companies that I put together, whatever,

122
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:01,081
so here are the eight steps, I'm not gonna run through it

123
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,474
cos this is not a finance course

124
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,672
but I run through all eight steps here,

125
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:09,836
of course I would go much slower in my courses

126
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,510
and then you can see that I've got that character there

127
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,233
from my PowToons presentation that we just looked at,

128
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,239
and so I love to use multiple presentation applications

129
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,531
when I make my courses, right?

130
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,581
And you can do that as well

131
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,984
when you make your presentations.

132
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,883
Okay, so let's look at another example here,

133
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:33,050
so in this case I'm explaining how a mutual fund works,

134
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:39,739
so in this case you've got a mutual fund or a hedge fund

135
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:43,799
that's located in New York and it shows you the hierarchy,

136
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,118
who does what, again, this is not a finance course

137
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:49,002
but I'll go through it quickly.

138
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,383
So the portfolio manager works on the West Coast

139
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:53,951
and she has a number of analysts reporting to her

140
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,306
and you can drill down to see what these analysts cover,

141
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:01,306
those stocks, okay? It's kinda neat.

142
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,589
Next up, I had a course where I want to talk

143
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,599
about investment banking and I try and make it fun,

144
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,766
what is an IPO, or initial public offering, right?

145
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:18,408
I love to dream big or I don't like to dream at all.

146
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:20,111
And then you can zoom out as well,

147
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,239
in this case we're talking about the New York Stock Exchange

148
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,052
and you don't just have the world in your hand,

149
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:26,219
you have the whole galaxy.

150
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:30,656
And then we talk about a mutual fund here

151
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:33,453
if you're working for a company

152
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,172
that analyzes Japanese stocks,

153
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:37,013
in this case, in this example,

154
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,563
the headquarters are in London

155
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:43,005
and let's say that you are the Japanese portfolio manager,

156
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,949
and you can see who reports to you,

157
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,968
in this case let's talk about the technology analyst

158
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,146
that covers Japanese technology stocks

159
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:53,749
and those are the stocks, okay, let's move on.

160
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,547
Another example I had was a day

161
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,596
in the life of a hedge fund analyst,

162
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,297
and I used to work in the hedge fund industry

163
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,589
so I kinda zoom in and tell you,

164
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,769
okay, we work in New York here,

165
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:08,051
I try to make it as authentic as possible,

166
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:11,665
you can zoom in, let me just skip a bunch of these here,

167
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:15,934
and then I like to actually tie it back into PowToons,

168
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,501
so we'll go back to PowToons for a second here,

169
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,238
and so here you have me, or an analyst, whatever,

170
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:23,380
that works for a hedge fund,

171
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,554
and this analyst is at his or her house in the morning

172
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,774
watching CNBC or whatever

173
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,791
and they notice that one of their stocks

174
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,001
went up a lot before the market opens,

175
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,415
then they travel to work,

176
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,662
and then they get into work and this is the morning meeting,

177
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:42,829
and this simulates how a morning meeting is conducted,

178
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:46,096
for example, in the hedge fund space

179
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:49,059
and that woman on the left is the portfolio manager,

180
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:51,078
and that person on the right

181
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,393
is the analyst that works for her

182
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:57,818
and he talks about his stocks during the morning meeting,

183
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:01,445
in this case he lost money with a GoPro stock position,

184
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,019
again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail on this

185
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,095
because this is not a finance course

186
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:08,332
and so what happens is, you can see

187
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,845
that he's got a great idea,

188
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:13,049
and I threw a light bulb there just to visualize it,

189
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,570
and we talk about how that analyst goes through an idea,

190
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,976
he's interested in stock called LinkedIn,

191
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,511
which is no longer public, and here's why he likes it,

192
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,701
yadda, yadda, yadda, you get it,

193
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:28,183
and then later on he is at an investor conference,

194
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:31,433
and this simulates him using his iPhone

195
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:36,836
to tell his boss to buy a certain stock

196
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:39,961
because the CEO of that company said something cool

197
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,767
about that stock, I'll skip through this pretty quickly

198
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:47,320
if I can, so he's sending the trade over to the trader

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,376
and then at the end of the day, he's the king of the world

200
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:55,899
in true Titanic format, hi, I'm seven. (laughs)

201
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,521
So that's that, it's pretty cool, it's a lot of fun to use.

202
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:02,770
Now, let's say you use a couple applications,

203
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,629
different presentation documents in one presentation,

204
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,959
how can you throw it together?

205
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,873
I personally use QuickTime to record the screen

206
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,796
and then I throw it in and I'll show you

207
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,677
how I do that in a second.

208
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:17,071
Before we get there though,

209
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,591
I love to look at new products

210
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,240
and there's one here that lets you

211
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,990
kinda use different applications

212
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,009
or different presentation applications together,

213
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,238
it is called SlideDog, I haven't used it that much

214
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,940
but you can basically throw in

215
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,724
different types of products together

216
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:36,956
and it will run them concurrently, that sort of thing.

217
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,916
Next up, there is another free program here

218
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,696
called LibreOffice, that's free in French

219
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:45,193
and many languages, it's pretty cool,

220
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:49,845
it kinda looks like an older version of PowerPoint,

221
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,147
I don't think they've updated this product

222
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,486
as much over the past couple of years

223
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:57,126
but it is free, and it's quite intuitive as well,

224
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,613
I'm not gonna show you how to use it

225
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,773
because it's very similar to a lot of the products

226
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,269
that we already use in this course,

227
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,436
meaning PowerPoint as well as Keynote.

228
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:10,174
So, in the next lecture I'm gonna show you

229
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:12,684
how I created this lecture here

230
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,877
but before I get there I just want to mention

231
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:17,050
that we covered basically 98%

232
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,314
or almost all the presentation software market

233
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:22,290
and there's issues using other products,

234
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,341
and those issues are as follows.

235
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:26,655
Number one, they don't have as many features,

236
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:29,165
number two, there's not great support

237
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,240
or upgrades to the product

238
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,311
and number three, there's a survivorship bias,

239
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,271
will this company be a going concern,

240
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,486
will it still be in business years from now,

241
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,984
so I'm trying to cover the bigger ones for now.

242
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:46,077
And that's it, but before we move on to the next lecture,

243
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,540
I want to show you just really quickly

244
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,295
how I inserted some of those videos on the screens

245
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,771
and again, in the next lecture

246
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:55,017
we'll talk about how I made this lecture in more detail

247
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:57,799
but I used QuickTime, you go to File,

248
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,517
New Screen Recording, but because I'm recording already,

249
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:03,577
it shows here as recording, and I want to mention

250
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,946
that QuickTime is also available not just on Mac platforms,

251
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:10,393
but it's available on Windows if you want to download it.
