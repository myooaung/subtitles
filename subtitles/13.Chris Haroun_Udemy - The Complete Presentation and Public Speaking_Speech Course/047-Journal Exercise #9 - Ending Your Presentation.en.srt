1
00:00:00,548 --> 00:00:02,664
Please open your success journal

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:04,663
and turn to exercise number nine,

3
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:07,504
which is called, "Ending Your Presentation".

4
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,199
In journal exercise number four, we discuss

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,216
in a lot of detail many, many, many different ways

6
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,440
to start your presentation.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,359
This current exercise, meaning exercise number nine

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,096
will help you to create an impactful and perfect way

9
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:25,712
to end your presentation

10
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:29,008
and you can end your presentations by answering one

11
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,968
or more answers in this exercise

12
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,791
and this will make a lot of sense to you

13
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,080
once you've completed the exercise.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,383
Please just skip questions that are not applicable

15
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,352
to this speech that you are giving.

16
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:42,775
Thank you.

17
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:45,912
You can end your presentation with one of the options

18
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:50,455
that we cover in this exercise or a bunch of them, okay?

19
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:53,656
Please again skip all questions that are not applicable

20
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:56,080
to this speech that you're giving, okay?

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,024
And as you can see, in the question list for exercise

22
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:03,573
number nine, we're getting to do four simple things, okay?

23
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:07,740
Number one: Write down one sentence on who your audience is.

24
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:11,197
Just please see your answer from journal exercise number one

25
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:14,597
and copy and paste the answer here if you want.

26
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:16,821
Number two and this one's optional:

27
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:19,973
Write down a few emotions that you want your audience

28
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:20,806
to feel

29
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,641
and please see your answers to journal exercise

30
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,345
number two and write down a few emotions

31
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:30,396
that you used or that you covered in that exercise.

32
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:31,961
Whatever you want your audience to feel

33
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,009
just jot it down here, okay?

34
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,689
Number three: Write down one sentence on the purpose

35
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,073
of your speech.

36
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,600
And again please see the answer to your journal exercise

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,592
number three and copy and paste them here if you want to.

38
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:49,592
Number four: Per the exercise, write down people

39
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,558
or organizations you might want to consider thanking

40
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:55,725
at the end of your speech.

41
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,048
Business presentations often end with a call to action.

42
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:03,750
If you're selling a product or a service, which

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,462
most business people are, then ask for the sale

44
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,078
at the end of your presentation or tell the audience

45
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:14,062
to please come and see me now or contact me

46
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:17,006
at this address if you have questions

47
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,902
and if potential customers approach you

48
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:22,366
and they sound interested in the product,

49
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,783
don't oversell, please, okay?

50
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:29,126
Always stop selling once you get the sense

51
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,054
that they are interested in buying the product.

52
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:35,380
If you keep seeling past the close,

53
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,676
you might lose the sale as this potential customer

54
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:43,084
might be thinking, "Gosh, I was really interested

55
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:47,228
"in buying that product, but why does he keep saying

56
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:49,405
"great things about the product?

57
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:53,535
"I mean, he seems desperate for the sale.

58
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,468
"Am I missing something, right?

59
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,772
"Why am I so lucky to be given this opportunity?

60
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:00,188
"Something seems off here."

61
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,468
You get the idea.

62
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,574
It's kind of like (laughs) when you're leaning about

63
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,773
asking people out on a date and you overdo it

64
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:09,536
and you come across desperate...

65
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm not gonna go there, okay?

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,471
I suck at dating advice.

67
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:15,447
Talk to Jimmy Nerang, right?

68
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:18,437
Go see his courses here in (mumbles) on that.

69
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,453
He's Mr. Confidence, actually a good guy.

70
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:21,373
I've met him, right?

71
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:22,897
Take his courses on that stuff.

72
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:23,921
Okay, sorry.

73
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,961
So what, Chris?

74
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:26,240
Moving on.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,465
If applicable, write down your closing,

76
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,529
ask for the sale comment, right?

77
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:33,762
For example, if you're interested in purchasing

78
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:36,020
this product, please see me now.

79
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,113
That sort of thing and I cringe when I say that, you know,

80
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:40,777
but...

81
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:42,162
'cause I hate asking for...

82
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:43,922
I kind of hate asking for business I kind of want

83
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:46,442
to offer a great service or a great product

84
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:50,930
and then people just kind of buy it yourself, but...

85
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,386
Sometimes there's gotta be a sense of urgency.

86
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:55,930
Like we have a special price or a sale that's valid

87
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,378
for anyone at the conference today.

88
00:03:58,378 --> 00:03:59,354
That sort of thing, right?

89
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:02,369
There sometimes has to be a sense of urgency.

90
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:05,841
That's why retailers have sales.

91
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:10,033
If they were always discounted, the products...

92
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,609
They wouldn't sell as well.

93
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,385
Anyway, there has to be a sense of urgency

94
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,746
if you're gonna ask for the business, right?

95
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:16,633
Okay.

96
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,729
The sense of urgency or call to action is pretty helpful.

97
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,441
Your call if you want to use this methodology

98
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,752
in the ending portion of your speech, okay?

99
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,756
It just, per the instructions in exercise number nine

100
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:30,308
and if applicable, just please write down

101
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:34,148
your closing ask for the sale script here.

102
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,132
Please keep in mind also, that all great entrepreneurs

103
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,324
and CEOs are sales people.

104
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:42,093
Okay, if they're not selling a product or a service,

105
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,108
they're selling themselves.

106
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:47,006
Kind of like at a job interview, okay?

107
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,684
And if you're not taking orders for a product or service

108
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:54,436
then just be sure to have business cards ready

109
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:57,916
or pamphlets or better yet, USB tokens,

110
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,524
right in your pocket in case an enormous potential

111
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,947
customer approaches you after the presentation, okay?

112
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:08,979
And here's a link actually where to buy these USB drives.

113
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,115
Buy the cheapest ones that will fit the size of your

114
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,243
presentation materials.

115
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,340
Your presentation materials won't really take up too

116
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,411
much space anyway, right?

117
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,324
And if you want to be really creative and different

118
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,407
and unique and stand out,

119
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:25,779
this is yet a bit expensive, but it's really worth it

120
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,323
then create your own business on a flash USB drive

121
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:32,722
that's the size of a thick business card

122
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:35,428
and there's so many fun examples

123
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:36,648
you can get online.

124
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:39,777
I think it's called customusb.com that'll kind of

125
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,496
help you get noticed.

126
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:44,121
You want to be different, you want to stand out.

127
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:48,893
And just give these things to massive potential customers

128
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:49,726
as they...

129
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,277
These things can be a bit pricey, right?

130
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:53,061
But definitely worth it, right?

131
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,490
Definitely worth it.

132
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,498
Remember, CIDER.

133
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:57,242
C-I-D-E-R.

134
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:59,616
As this is convincing, interesting, different,

135
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,904
educational, and relevant.

136
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:01,930
That little thing is, okay?

137
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,880
It's pretty fun too.

138
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,664
Heck, bring these to a job interview

139
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:09,481
if you want to take a calculated risk and really stand

140
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,664
out from the others.

141
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:16,264
You can make a one page resume and then have a USB card

142
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,536
in the corner like this that has exhibits on...

143
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:23,271
I don't know, stuff you've done or a video resume too.

144
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,735
It's kind of fun, but off topic, but I want to go here.

145
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:26,791
Hear me out please.

146
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,845
Here's some other examples of business cards and flyers

147
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,389
to give massive potential customers at the end

148
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,341
of your presentation or during an interview.

149
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,814
I had a lot of fun making this lecture here

150
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,099
there's tons of examples right?

151
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,955
You can even email your PDFs if they are small enough

152
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:48,360
and here's the amazing, free way to make your

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,042
huge PDF's small if they're too big.

154
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,034
The PDF version of the success journal that you can

155
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:58,170
download for this course was enormous, right?

156
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,697
So, I compressed it with this amazing, free PDF compressor.

157
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,780
I think it's a pdfcompress.com, okay?

158
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:13,091
Also, please write down in this exercise if applicable,

159
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:15,115
did you mention your contact details

160
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,371
when you ended your presentation.

161
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,819
Please don't forget to immediately connect using Linked In

162
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,323
with all contacts that you meet

163
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,243
the day of your presentation that you do this.

164
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:29,410
So write yes or no and put comments down if you want to.

165
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,931
I want you to memorize the first few words of the

166
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,570
ending portion of your speech, okay?

167
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,106
Why?

168
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,922
Because sometimes you have to end your speech early

169
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:44,923
for whatever reason that is completely out of your control.

170
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,946
Like someone tells you during your speech that we're

171
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:50,402
running out of time here, right?

172
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:53,570
In this case, just say your closing line

173
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,194
and if it's a business speech and with a call to action.

174
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,778
Meaning, asking for the sale or

175
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:02,898
listing your contact details or asking potential customers

176
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:05,327
to approach you right now.

177
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,687
You want to strike while the iron's hot

178
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,218
and while you have their attention, okay?

179
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:14,570
Here are a few words to use to start the ending

180
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,186
of your speech.

181
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:19,234
And you can always use these as a crutch

182
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:23,401
go to and for some reason must end right now, okay?

183
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,278
Again, it's out of your control sometimes, okay?

184
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,110
Here are five examples.

185
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,798
Number one: The bottom line is...

186
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:33,662
Second example is: In conclusion...

187
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:36,579
The third is: And so, the best solution to or

188
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,594
recommendation is...

189
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:41,834
Number four: Our next steps are...

190
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,146
Number five: We talked about topic one, two, three,

191
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:47,318
or whatever structure you use and the best approach

192
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,818
to take is this...

193
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:52,902
Before we complete exercise number nine for how

194
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,918
to end your speech, please review journal exercise

195
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,622
number four if you want to end your speech with

196
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,504
one of the following:

197
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,142
a quote,

198
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,599
and I include a 150 quote examples in exercise four.

199
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:09,151
Actually, I'll attach that same PDF with the 150 quotes

200
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,439
to this exercise as well, okay?

201
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:14,054
You'll see in the resources section, right?

202
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,903
And also if you want to end with a video,

203
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:19,943
a relevant or personal story, a historical event

204
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:23,046
that's relevant of course, so what?

205
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:24,990
An outline of your speech, for example,

206
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,478
we talked about X, Y, and Z and the bottom line is this.

207
00:09:28,478 --> 00:09:31,067
In an image, I included 30 examples next to exercise

208
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,589
number four, you can see it there, including this one

209
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,922
on how to make memes, right?

210
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:38,828
And then lastly,

211
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,540
please write your

212
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,949
concluding sentence here as well, okay?

213
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,260
And you can combine several different ways to end

214
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,844
your speech as mentioned over the last couple of pages.

215
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:54,180
So, for example, per this image, the bottom line is...

216
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,237
Please let me know if you have any questions

217
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,059
or if you're interested in learning more about the product,

218
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,492
yada, yada, okay?

219
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,133
Anyway, you can see the examples here

220
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:07,011
and just write down my concluding sentence is or are, okay?

221
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:08,459
In that spot there.

222
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,427
And again, the reason why I do this is...

223
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:13,376
Again, it's gonna be out of your control sometimes.

224
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:16,791
Like say, say the speaker before you, if it's a conference,

225
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,958
spoke for way too long, right?

226
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,062
Or if you see people starting to get up and leave

227
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:23,729
for whatever reason.

228
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,209
You don't want to lose their mind share, right?

229
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,697
And so, you can basically have that crutch, right,

230
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,049
immediately to say...

231
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,097
That's why I want you to write down your concluding

232
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,597
sentence and just remember it.
