1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:02,498
Moving on to,

2
00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:05,792
words or things never to say when answering questions.

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,356
Okay. So I don't want you to use the words honestly.

4
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:11,473
We're gonna tell you the truth. Okay?

5
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:13,732
Ever when you're answering questions.

6
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:18,079
And the reason is I worked at a big hedge fund years ago.

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,278
And they brought in 25 year CIA and FBI veterans

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:24,688
to tell us how to tell if somebody's lying.

9
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:26,375
And it's really interesting

10
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,792
because there's certain things people say

11
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:32,984
which could indicate they're not telling the truth.

12
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,016
And you know some of those words

13
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:38,461
are honestly, or to tell you the truth,

14
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:39,489
that sort of thing.

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,977
So it's, I know it might seem a little bit of stretch

16
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:43,119
and in different cultures

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,732
there's different ways to interpret it,

18
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,761
but anyway I just thought I'd throw that out there for you.

19
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,621
Because honestly I love teaching this course.

20
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,838
And to tell you the truth I'm really enjoying teaching you.

21
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,021
Just kidding of course I am.

22
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,944
Okay.

23
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:59,384
Don't do what I do, do what I say.

24
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,295
I'm just kidding.

25
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:01,694
Okay and next up,

26
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,687
never bad mouth a competition or anybody,

27
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:08,482
or a culture of any other firm.

28
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,341
Okay. Don't ever say anything negative right?

29
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:13,004
Otherwise people might not trust you, right?

30
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,289
It just, it is what it is.

31
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,706
And never ramble,

32
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,352
keep your answers short, okay?

33
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:22,486
And if you find yourself rambling

34
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,409
then immediately finish the sentence by saying,

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,092
and so the bottom line is,

36
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:30,564
and you put your final thought in there, okay?
