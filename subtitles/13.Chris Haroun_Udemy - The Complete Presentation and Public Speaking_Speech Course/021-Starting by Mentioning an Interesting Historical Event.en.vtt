00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:04.389
It was 47 years ago today,

2
00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:08.129
Paul McCartney announced that the Beatles were breaking up.

3
00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.597
I think that McCartney's best songs were when he was

4
00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:12.941
with the Beatles,

5
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:16.291
as there was this healthy co-op petition

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.990
between John Lennon, cooperation and competition.

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.239
I think that competition is good for the consumer.

8
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.141
And you can give a real example of a business scenario

9
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:30.093
that's relevant for this speech.

10
00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.010
Remember the solo test.

11
00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:35.192
So, in this example,

12
00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:38.445
we use a historical event that occurred on this day,

13
00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:43.096
and you can actually go to this web address right here,

14
00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:45.283
and enter in the date,

15
00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:47.896
and you will find out exactly what happened

16
00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:50.342
on the day in history.

17
00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.347
And if you are having issues coming up

18
00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:55.992
with something creative or different,

19
00:00:55.992 --> 00:01:00.141
or something interesting, in order to start out your speech,

20
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:05.091
check out that history website for ideas on what happened

21
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.637
in this date in history, okay?

22
00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:11.485
Also, search for historic images too when you present

23
00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:12.485
a new place.

24
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.058
Now here's an example that is,

25
00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:19.225
really touching if I were to present in Canada, okay?

26
00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:24.739
Or you can create a few fake headlines on a newspaper

27
00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:25.699
in the future.

28
00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:27.866
Like, this one here. Okay?

29
00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.272
It's, this is from a great movie.

30
00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:34.847
It, I bet you know what movie it is.

31
00:01:34.847 --> 00:01:36.597
Try and take a guess.

32
00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:38.628
Okay.

33
00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:39.896
If you haven't seen it, it's Back To The Future.

34
00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.137
You gotta see it.

35
00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.448
And it's really cool because Back To The Future

36
00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:44.995
came out 1985,

37
00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.039
and they projected 30 years into the future,

38
00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.941
and they predicate, I should say,

39
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:50.541
what's gonna happen. Right?

40
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:53.340
And they show this futuristic newspaper.

41
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.792
Oh, look how futuristic USA Today's logo looks, right?

42
00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:58.947
Hill Valley edition.

43
00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:01.645
But it's kinda, it might take a little while for you to,

44
00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:05.735
to create this, but it's something that's incredibly unique.

45
00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:07.741
Right? And you can shock an audience

46
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:10.499
with something kinda fun like this. Right?

47
00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.547
Okay. Anyway. Great movie. You gotta see it.

48
00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:15.096
Back To The Future. Marty McFly.

49
00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:16.291
Great flick. Great flick.

50
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:18.458
Okay. So, quick side note.

51
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.949
You gotta enjoy creating the content for the presentation,

52
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.240
and if you got the time,

53
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.992
you don't feel like you're enjoying it, you know,

54
00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:29.433
creating the content for your presentation,

55
00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:31.992
then please just come back to it later. Right?

56
00:02:31.992 --> 00:02:36.159
Or put on some really cool inspiring background music.

57
00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:40.643
Right? If you enjoy everything you do,

58
00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:42.637
then you'll be amazing at it.

59
00:02:42.637 --> 00:02:45.037
This is why programmers work so hard when they're coding,

60
00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:46.339
because they love it.

61
00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:48.696
So just, try to be very creative,

62
00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:51.196
and enjoy the process as well.

63
00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.335
And if you do, your passion will come through

64
00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:57.817
when you're presenting on game day.
