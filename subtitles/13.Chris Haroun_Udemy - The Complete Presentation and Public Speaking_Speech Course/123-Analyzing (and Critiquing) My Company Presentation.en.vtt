00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:18.923
How are you doing?
(audience cheering)

2
00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:19.799
We're good? Yeah?

3
00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:20.897
Excellent, excellent.

4
00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:23.928
Well I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity

5
00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.330
to let me speak here.

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.487
I'm very humbled to be a part of this, all right?

7
00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:30.772
I've never been happier, never been happier.

8
00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:33.243
And for the first time in my life, I feel like I

9
00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:34.471
don't have a job.

10
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.179
And I love it, it's fun.

11
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.262
So, Mark Twain had this great saying.

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.527
He said that the two most important days in a person's life

13
00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:46.341
are number one, they day they're born.

14
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.798
And number two, the day they find out why.

15
00:00:49.798 --> 00:00:51.215
Pretty cool, huh?

16
00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.059
And so I humbly believe that if you get up in the morning

17
00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.820
and you tell yourself you're going to work,

18
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.870
then with all due respect, you're doing it wrong.

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.533
You need to find your passion.

20
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.464
You need to find your raison d'etre.

21
00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.417
Gregory, was that right?

22
00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:07.479
Did I pronounce that right?

23
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.312
That was good?

24
00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:09.206
All right.

25
00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:10.450
You need to find your purpose.

26
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.738
You know, what was the reason you were put on this earth?

27
00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.181
And so, for me it's teaching, I love it.

28
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:18.034
I wish I discovered it much earlier in my life.

29
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:21.557
So in terms of my background, I'm from Canada.

30
00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:24.572
Every now and then, you'll hear me say oot and aboot.

31
00:01:24.572 --> 00:01:25.514
Any Canadians here?

32
00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:26.801
(audience member cheering)

33
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:28.083
Right there?

34
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:28.916
One? Two?

35
00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:31.328
That's what I'm talkin' aboot.

36
00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:32.161
Right there!

37
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:33.917
(audience laughing)

38
00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:34.750
Excellent, excellent.

39
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.815
So yeah, I'm from Canada originally.

40
00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.406
I started a couple of tech companies.

41
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.649
I worked in consulting, I came down to the States

42
00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.166
to work on Wall Street.

43
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.193
Did the whole business school thing.

44
00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:47.069
Worked for a hedge fund, came out to the west coast and

45
00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.299
worked for a venture capital firm.

46
00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.068
And I keep saying the word work, right?

47
00:01:52.068 --> 00:01:54.554
Those were jobs, those were jobs.

48
00:01:54.554 --> 00:01:57.377
And then I started teaching at night.

49
00:01:57.377 --> 00:01:59.001
And I absolutely love it.

50
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.685
And teaching is very similar, actually, to working

51
00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.390
in venture capital, where I used to work.

52
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.654
And the reason I say that is when you work

53
00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:08.310
at venture capital, you sit on boards.

54
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.327
And your mission is to help your companies grow.

55
00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:15.681
And as a teacher, your mission is to help your students

56
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.909
grow career-wise and help them find their passion and

57
00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.147
their purpose as well.

58
00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:23.405
It's a great gig, it really is.

59
00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:26.725
And the wonderful thing about what all of us do

60
00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:30.892
is our passions are to help others be more successful.

61
00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:35.589
And there's not many professions like that in the world.

62
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.993
Okay, so what do I teach?

63
00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:39.766
I teach business courses.

64
00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:41.808
I teach personal development courses.

65
00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:43.845
And I most recently started teaching

66
00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.899
free teacher courses as well.

67
00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:51.362
And so, I'm gonna talk about three things today.

68
00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:53.843
All right, so let me kick it off with

69
00:02:53.843 --> 00:02:55.190
why I teach online.

70
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.422
So I do a lot of charity work in East Palo Alto

71
00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:01.904
on the board of this wonderful charity.

72
00:03:01.904 --> 00:03:03.786
It's called the Lemo Foundation.

73
00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:07.618
And our goal is to increase the high school graduation rate

74
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:11.368
in East Palo Alto from 40% to 100%.

75
00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:14.400
Crazy, isn't it?

76
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.693
And so, I created this course and I really poured

77
00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:19.378
my heart into it.

78
00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:21.529
And this course I created for these students that I taught

79
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.041
on weekends in East Palo Alto

80
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.208
was basically a course to teach them how to be independent.

81
00:03:29.694 --> 00:03:33.592
And so I thought about, okay, I teach MBA schools at night.

82
00:03:33.592 --> 00:03:36.583
I've gone to MBA school years ago, whatever.

83
00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.425
I have work experience.

84
00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:41.556
What can I teach them to make them independent?

85
00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.153
And so I created this course called

86
00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:45.486
An Entire MBA in One Course.

87
00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:48.911
And, you know, I taught it from my heart first.

88
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.622
And I really believe that if you think with your head first,

89
00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:54.971
your heart second, you won't be successful.

90
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.835
And I want to thank all of you.

91
00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.853
One of my students, named Folia Becker, right?

92
00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:02.138
She was one of my business school students in class.

93
00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:02.971
You know her?

94
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:03.804
(audience member cheering)

95
00:04:03.804 --> 00:04:06.283
She's great, a little shout out!

96
00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:07.799
I wish she was here, she's awesome.

97
00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.632
Really, really nice.

98
00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:11.752
So she was one of my students at a school called

99
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.713
The Hult International School of Business.

100
00:04:13.713 --> 00:04:16.178
And she reached out to me after she graduated and she said

101
00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:18.636
Chris, do you have time to meet for a mentor meeting?

102
00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.493
And so of course I said yes.

103
00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:23.165
A company I had never really heard of before

104
00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:24.314
and I was blown away.

105
00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:27.480
I was amazed by just the, the optimism

106
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.364
from everybody walking around.

107
00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:32.100
I felt so damn old, right?

108
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.639
You, you've all accomplished a lot.

109
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.823
You know, you're very young for that too, it's amazing.

110
00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:38.775
But the culture, in the sense of trust and community.

111
00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:42.062
Reminded me of eBay back in the 90s, right?

112
00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:44.308
And that's a compliment, right?

113
00:04:44.308 --> 00:04:47.043
(scattered laughing)

114
00:04:47.043 --> 00:04:48.317
I'll stop right there.

115
00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:50.207
(scattered laughing)

116
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:53.310
And so she introduced me to Michelle.

117
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.655
Let's get a shout out for Michelle, too.

118
00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:59.287
Here we go, Michelle, yeah!
(audience clapping)

119
00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:00.763
We have to do a shoutout for every employee

120
00:05:00.763 --> 00:05:01.596
that's not here anymore.

121
00:05:01.596 --> 00:05:03.245
Right? Right?

122
00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:05.547
Maybe that's saying something about me, I don't know.

123
00:05:05.547 --> 00:05:07.641
So Michelle's now in Hong Kong, I love her to death.

124
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.046
She's fantastic, she helped me out a lot.

125
00:05:10.046 --> 00:05:11.575
And I started doing due diligence.

126
00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:15.554
I humbly believe that a company is only as good

127
00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:18.274
as its customer support.

128
00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:20.866
And that means a lot because

129
00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:24.801
the support team sets a good precedent and influences

130
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:26.555
us teachers, right?

131
00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:28.773
And it influences us to provide excellent

132
00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:31.282
customer support for our students.

133
00:05:31.282 --> 00:05:33.129
And the customer is always right.

134
00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.129
Okay, great.

135
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:38.996
So next up, we've got my overall experience.

136
00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:40.454
It's been incredible.

137
00:05:40.454 --> 00:05:42.279
Again, it's not a job, it's a passion.

138
00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.315
Love it to death, love it to death.

139
00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:45.785
Let's move on to my humble thoughts

140
00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:48.171
on opportunities moving forward.

141
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:49.834
Big data platform.

142
00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:53.417
And in venture capital, we like to say that

143
00:05:54.412 --> 00:05:57.123
the loneliest place in the world is page two

144
00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:00.244
of Google search rankings, right?

145
00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:01.744
And our content...

146
00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.810
Okay, what do we have next here?

147
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.247
There's a great quote here from Mark Zuckerberg.

148
00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:10.868
He said the biggest risk is not taking any risk.

149
00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:13.018
In a world that's changing really quickly

150
00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.730
the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail

151
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.906
is not taking risks.

152
00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:18.887
And I believe it.

153
00:06:18.887 --> 00:06:20.756
And so I want to talk about risk-taking

154
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:23.416
and being the market leader.

155
00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.268
And the best example of this is Netflix.

156
00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:28.325
Netflix has taken a lot of risks.

157
00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.480
They're the market leader.

158
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.148
Netflix, of course, changed their whole business model.

159
00:06:33.148 --> 00:06:35.588
They got rid of the DVD business almost.

160
00:06:35.588 --> 00:06:37.656
And they do streaming now.

161
00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:38.890
But they did a couple of other things, too.

162
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.708
They took risks.

163
00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:42.523
And so Bill Gates used to say,

164
00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:44.800
that Microsoft, when he ran the company,

165
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.407
Microsoft is one half-years away from bankruptcy

166
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.490
at all times.

167
00:06:49.657 --> 00:06:52.574
And the late, great Andy Grove used to say

168
00:06:52.574 --> 00:06:54.579
that only the paranoid survive.

169
00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:55.645
And I believe that.

170
00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:57.972
I believe that, you gotta take risk and move

171
00:06:57.972 --> 00:07:00.939
the goal post out as often as you can

172
00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:03.106
otherwise you end up in...

173
00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:06.424
And then you've got this land expand type business model

174
00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:07.598
for that, right?

175
00:07:07.598 --> 00:07:08.598
Pretty cool.

176
00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:12.156
I now want to talk about YouTube stars.

177
00:07:12.156 --> 00:07:15.061
And I've got three kids, three boys.

178
00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:17.805
It's crazy but it's fun. I've got a 12-year-old,

179
00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:19.791
11-year-old, and a seven-year-old.

180
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:23.692
And it is fascinating how they embrace media and content.

181
00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:26.263
It's completely different from the way I did growing up.

182
00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:30.277
They don't watch much TV. What they do is, they and

183
00:07:30.277 --> 00:07:33.527
their friends love these YouTube stars.

184
00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:37.998
There's this guy they love named Roman Atwood.

185
00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:40.564
Anybody heard of Roman Atwood?

186
00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:41.397
A couple people?

187
00:07:41.397 --> 00:07:43.266
Okay, cool, I had no idea who he was

188
00:07:43.266 --> 00:07:44.254
until my kids told me.

189
00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:45.151
But It's amazing.

190
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:49.933
This guy has got 11 million subscribers on YouTube.

191
00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:53.477
But I mentioned this because this next generation

192
00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:56.202
of YouTube stars, they're born digital.

193
00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:58.667
The margin structure for putting their content...

194
00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:00.119
Embrace social media, YouTube, et cetera.

195
00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:03.475
I think that's a great opportunity longer term.

196
00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:07.714
Okay, next up I want to talk about audio only.

197
00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:10.162
I believe the next platform that's gonna be relevant

198
00:08:10.162 --> 00:08:12.657
in technology is voice.

199
00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:14.298
Right, we've had the Alexa at home and a lot of you

200
00:08:14.298 --> 00:08:17.478
have Alexas as well, and it's amazing.

201
00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:20.064
It's an incredible platform, right?

202
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:22.707
And so, it's the next operating system that matters.

203
00:08:22.707 --> 00:08:27.063
And when I look at audible.com, I think that this is

204
00:08:27.063 --> 00:08:28.901
probably the best long-term subscription business

205
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:30.151
model there is.

206
00:08:31.318 --> 00:08:33.799
And as a venture capitalist, I used to love,

207
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.457
and when I worked at Wall Street, I used to love investing

208
00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:38.540
in companies that had streaming-based

209
00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:42.516
subscription long-term contracts.

210
00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:45.194
Because what happens is you lock in consumers

211
00:08:45.194 --> 00:08:47.799
The churn is lower and you get better revenue growth

212
00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:48.632
over time.

213
00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:51.491
You lose a lot of share.

214
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:55.221
And I want to talk really quickly about iTunes.

215
00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:57.059
iTunes was the market leader for years.

216
00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:58.361
It kind of still is.

217
00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:00.465
But you know what, I read this awesome report from Neilson's

218
00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:04.060
this morning that said that iTunes music sales are

219
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.513
declining more, year over year now than offline music sales.

220
00:09:08.513 --> 00:09:11.719
And iTunes, to me, feels like a

221
00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:16.016
second-rate, bloated client-server software program.

222
00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:18.022
They didn't reinvent themselves.

223
00:09:18.022 --> 00:09:20.227
And Spotify certainly has.

224
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.369
So a shoutout to Spotify

225
00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:24.186
and I think as the market leader, you got to keep

226
00:09:24.186 --> 00:09:27.009
taking risks and reinventing yourself.

227
00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:30.840
Okay, so, next up, a feature I would love to see humbly

228
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.840
is charitable donations at checkout.

229
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.143
Apple actually did a good job with this

230
00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:40.204
to be intellectually honest with the red product line

231
00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.803
And eBay did as well.

232
00:09:41.803 --> 00:09:42.720
Okay, cool.

233
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.592
That's pretty damn cool.

234
00:09:47.592 --> 00:09:49.284
And so, in closing

235
00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:52.064
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

236
00:09:52.064 --> 00:09:53.473
For changing my life.

237
00:09:53.473 --> 00:09:55.739
I couldn't be more proud, pleased,

238
00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:58.108
and humbled to be a part of this.

239
00:09:58.108 --> 00:09:59.610
So thank you very much.

240
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.610
(audience clapping)

241
00:10:05.728 --> 00:10:08.877
There's no better feeling than having helped somebody

242
00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:12.010
you know, find their passion. Or get a job.

243
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.994
And I've had a number of students reach out to me

244
00:10:15.994 --> 00:10:18.221
keep asking over and over and over again

245
00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:19.177
how should they.

246
00:10:19.177 --> 00:10:20.799
Outstanding, so,
(audience applause)

247
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:24.132
love them, they're great, they're great.

248
00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.962
So I want to talk about my mistakes first.

249
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:32.406
Okay, before I talk about what's worked.

250
00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:34.611
What I initially did was...

251
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:38.314
And I get this impression that people...

252
00:10:38.314 --> 00:10:41.086
I appreciate it, I recently published a course called

253
00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:43.216
Forty Tips for Teaching Online.

254
00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:45.990
And I talked about forty of my biggest failures, right?

255
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.249
And I felt that sharing my failures would help

256
00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:52.338
a lot of teachers out.

257
00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:56.584
And the biggest failure I had was I kept trying to buy

258
00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:59.057
different microphones, different equipment.

259
00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:00.552
And it's not that easy, man.

260
00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:03.197
It's not like when you use an iPhone and you take a picture

261
00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:04.396
it's pretty intuitive.

262
00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:07.016
But when you video at home,

263
00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:08.553
you gotta worry about the lighting

264
00:11:08.553 --> 00:11:10.960
No two lights can be different colors

265
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.662
you have to have special towels on the wall to absorb

266
00:11:13.662 --> 00:11:15.562
the sounds and whatnot.

267
00:11:15.562 --> 00:11:18.739
And I wasted a lot of money in a couple months.

268
00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:21.118
And then my wife came up with the great idea...

269
00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:23.662
We used to use Airbnb at our house.

270
00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:26.371
And Airbnb, when we first started doing it,

271
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.355
they sent a photographer over to our house

272
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.036
a week after we signed up.

273
00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:33.926
Well, I'm so incredibly inspired by my students

274
00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.840
my favorite stories are the ones that are

275
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.370
my students that are poor, smart, and hungry

276
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.537
and feel like they were kind of dealt a bad hand of cards

277
00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:46.183
just being able to help them get to the next level

278
00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:48.185
get into a business school or undergraduate school

279
00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:50.973
or wherever it might be or be independent

280
00:11:50.973 --> 00:11:53.230
it's just this sense of purpose.

281
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.167
I really wish I had discovered teaching earlier in my life

282
00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:00.250
I mean, it's so awesome to be able to

283
00:12:01.411 --> 00:12:02.862
tell yourself every day when you go to bed

284
00:12:02.862 --> 00:12:04.644
that you helped improve somebody's life.

285
00:12:04.644 --> 00:12:07.547
And like I said in my opening here today,

286
00:12:07.547 --> 00:12:09.368
there's not many professions that you can actually

287
00:12:09.368 --> 00:12:12.399
say you've helped somebody to realize

288
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.718
their full potential, their full passion.

289
00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:17.480
And I'm incredibly blessed to be and honored and humbled

290
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.076
to be a part of this, Thank you.
