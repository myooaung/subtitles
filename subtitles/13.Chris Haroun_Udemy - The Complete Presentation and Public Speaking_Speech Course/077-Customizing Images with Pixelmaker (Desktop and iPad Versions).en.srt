1
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:03,899
Let's talk about Pixelmator, it's this cool app

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,697
you can get from the App Store here on Macs.

3
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:09,487
You can also get it on your iPad, and I'll show you the

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,143
iPad demo in a second, okay you can download it here.

5
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:15,562
It's as complicated as it's gonna get for me personally

6
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:18,129
when it comes to images, but I wanna show you a couple

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,433
of cool things you can do.

8
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,616
Little bit complicated, little bit overwhelming for

9
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:26,117
me personally, but let's go to my favorite image website

10
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:29,605
and get, I don't know, let's download an image to play

11
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:31,067
around with.

12
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:34,400
Search for the word people, scroll down,

13
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:40,406
ah here we go, that looks fun, painted smiley.

14
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:43,804
Okay, here's what we'll do, then we'll go to file

15
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:47,222
open, we'll open that smiley face, 'kay here,

16
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,135
so the first thing I'll show you is,

17
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:51,892
if you want to change an image a little bit,

18
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:53,749
I'm not gonna do all this layer crazy stuff,

19
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:56,358
'cause I'm not smart enough for that, but watch this.

20
00:00:56,358 --> 00:01:00,813
Say we wanted to get rid of, I don't know, say these

21
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:04,300
glasses, click on here like that, and you're like,

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,461
you know what dude, this guy's not supposed to have

23
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,040
glasses at all, right?

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,300
So what we do, is we draw around here, and I'm gonna

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,383
fast forward this on high speed mode.

26
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:18,848
And then, see what happens, there you go!

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,972
Got rid of the glasses, I told you he shouldn't have

28
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:25,603
had glasses, I'll clean it up a little bit more.

29
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:28,805
Little bit more, isn't that neat?

30
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,472
It's really, really cool, right?

31
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:35,076
And then you're like, hey wait a second, this guy here

32
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:37,776
shouldn't have all these little dimples, that's not fair.

33
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,336
(Laughing)

34
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:42,457
So it's not perfect, whatever, you can see it kinda

35
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:43,972
work, isn't that cool?

36
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:45,629
It's really neat, really neat.

37
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,796
Now, I want to show you Pixelmator here on the iPad, 'kay.

38
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,901
It's a lot easier to use than the Mac version.

39
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:56,401
Alright, see here.

40
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,840
And by the way you can use QuickTime to record your

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,206
iPhone if you want, or your iPad, just plug it in and

42
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,262
go to QuickTime, per that image, the bottom left hand

43
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:09,262
corner there, which I just threw on.

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,810
Okay, so I actually made my course image using

45
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,072
Pixelmator on the iPad, right it's pretty cool.

46
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:20,239
So, let' say I wanted to get rid of the Oscar image

47
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:25,528
there, okay, so I click here, and you go retouch,

48
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,796
and if you can, use Pixelmator only on the iPad,

49
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,416
it's way easier than a desktop.

50
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,545
Let's say I want to get rid of the Oscar dude,

51
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:36,712
you zoom in here, you go here, right, you go retouch,

52
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:41,559
and it's gonna say whoa, what do you want to do?

53
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:45,193
I'm like, okay, I'll repair, I'll remove it,

54
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:49,219
and I'll paint over top of it and I get a bigger brush

55
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,802
if I want, makes it way easier.

56
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:56,530
And it's gone, let's say I want to get rid of that

57
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,113
clicker in my hand.

58
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:02,881
Alright, now let's say I want to get rid of

59
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:09,300
my laptop, it shouldn't be there on the stage, right.

60
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,467
So I go here, and I'll go retouch, repair, and actually

61
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:20,255
I'm gonna make the brush a bit bigger this time.

62
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,702
Pretty cool.

63
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:30,156
Wow, my laptop's gone, how awesome is that?

64
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:34,323
Let's get rid of some of the people in the front there.

65
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,188
Not perfect but, it's kinda fun.

66
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:42,355
Now, let's say I want to get rid of that white stripe

67
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:45,795
on my shoe, because I'm very insecure about that white

68
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:48,583
stripe, on just my right shoe, not the left one.

69
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:52,000
So I'll go here, I'll go retouch, repair.

70
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,585
Ah, it's okay, not perfect.

71
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:06,548
Alright, now let's do something a little bit out there.

72
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:09,609
Let's say I want to, oh wow that hand looks awful

73
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,082
that close, let's say I want to get rid of the microphone

74
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:15,915
there okay, so let's go here, repair, retouch.

75
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,985
Get rid of that guy, goodbye microphone forever.

76
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:22,889
Not bad huh?

77
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,447
Now watch this, gone.

78
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:29,187
Not perfect, but you can play around with it a little bit.

79
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:33,479
Alright let's go back and let's say, actually in this

80
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,426
picture here, it was crazy, there was like a cup right by

81
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:39,891
his book, and a bunch of other stuff, say I want to get

82
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:42,209
rid of a couple of those wires in the background.

83
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:46,125
You go retouch, repair, let me zoom in a bit here,

84
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,758
you see that wire there?

85
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,508
Let me get rid of it.

86
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,361
Gone, almost.

87
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,444
It's good enough, and what happens if

88
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,554
we get rid of the Echo?

89
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:08,368
That's not bad actually, 'cause if you zoom out,

90
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:11,451
wow, I just torched that Amazon Echo.

91
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:16,472
And let's say, oops, let's say I want to get rid of

92
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,421
I don't know, the doorknob.

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,657
It's pretty cool.

94
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,787
And then you zoom out and it looks better.

95
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,000
Isn't that wild?

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,401
It's amazing.

97
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,276
Say I want to get rid of the plug, alright last one

98
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:41,359
I promise, okay so I go repair, here,

99
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:47,684
and I get rid of the plug, I don't like that plug on

100
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:51,378
the wall, and Mr. Cord you gotta go as well.

101
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:54,095
And you, get off my crown molding, or floorboard

102
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,636
whatever you call it.

103
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,886
Ah, works okay.

104
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,272
Let's see, zoom out, not bad.

105
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:05,582
Alright white speaker there, you're ruining my picture.

106
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:09,165
Repair, repair, white speaker you gotta go.

107
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,602
It's just one of those things.

108
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:15,435
Gone.

109
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,399
Wow, the shadow's still there though.

110
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,820
And let's see, that cable looks ugly.

111
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,237
It's good enough.

112
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:29,572
And that entire cable, you gotta go sir.

113
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:33,260
That is so awesome, ah man you gotta download this,

114
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,027
this is the coolest thing.

115
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,444
Wow, look at that, it's gone.

116
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:40,864
Incredible, incredible.

117
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:43,229
Okay, that's it you can get lost in this one for

118
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,404
hours, but you can retouch old pictures,

119
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:48,989
if you break up with somebody you can take 'em out

120
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,496
of pictures easily too.

121
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:53,041
Wow, the future is now, amazing, amazing.

122
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,023
Alright let me know if you have any questions, thanks.
