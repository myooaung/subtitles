00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,179
Please open up your Success Journal and turn to exercise

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,017
number eight, which is called, Beating Writer's Block.

3
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:09,201
In order to beat writer's block and to get

4
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:11,701
into that ideal state of mind.

5
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:17,161
Please think of a moment in your life, when you were

6
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:20,780
incredibly creative, when you wrote an essay,

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,477
or a speech, or a piece of music.

8
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:25,770
And please answer the following questions for me.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,209
Number one, I was in an ideal state of mind when

10
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:32,209
I created or wrote this.

11
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:35,391
K, and just write that.

12
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:38,093
The approximate date when that occurred was,

13
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:40,554
write down the date.

14
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:43,721
The exact location was, write it down.

15
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,485
Was there any background noise or music?

16
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:49,061
If, so what was it?

17
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:50,228
Write it down.

18
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:54,226
If you can remember, write down how you felt then.

19
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:59,100
And if you can remember, what were some additional

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,167
reasons that you were creative then.

21
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,458
K.

22
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,860
Another question is, what limiting beliefs do you have

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,625
right now that might hurt your ability

24
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,722
to be creative right now?

25
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:14,178
K, these might be new beliefs that you developed as you've

26
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:16,230
gotten a bit older, that you gotta ditch.

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,237
K.

28
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,230
Okay.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,987
Also, what can you do right now

30
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:23,303
to obliterate these limiting beliefs?

31
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:25,031
K, and just...

32
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:27,343
I want you to take that walk to eliminate

33
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:28,653
writer's block as well.

34
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,634
That's part of this exercise, if you need to.

35
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:34,818
Okay, also, what are five additional things that you can do

36
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:38,022
right now, in order to get back into

37
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:40,393
that ideal creative state of mind?

38
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:45,339
For example, I can get rid of distractions, like turning

39
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,787
off my cell phone right now.

40
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:50,390
Right, and then I want you to list four more things.

41
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,989
Okay, and just please take your time with this.

42
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:53,994
As...

43
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:57,961
Your content creation is a product also of your current

44
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:01,002
ideal environment and state of mind.

45
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:05,885
Right and lastly for me, sometimes when I'm not feeling that

46
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:10,127
great, I'll snap out of it by meditating, or close my eyes

47
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,563
and just thinking about a moment when I was incredibly

48
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:16,404
exuberant and happy in my life.

49
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,409
Right.

50
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,323
And for me, my wife Christine, and my three boys are

51
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:23,034
the most important thing obviously in my life,

52
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:26,428
but one moment that I'll never forget was in, October

53
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,826
or September 2015, when my sons and I were watching

54
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:31,800
a Blue Jay's game, a baseball game on TV.

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,967
And one of our players hit this, incredible home run.

56
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,131
He flipped his bat, whatever.

57
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:43,225
And we were so excited, we were jumping up and down.

58
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,921
Yelling, "Woohoo", whatever.

59
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:48,605
And I lost my voice, right, because I was so happy, right.

60
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:51,497
I don't know think about a time in your life

61
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:52,622
when you lost your voice.

62
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:53,920
Maybe it was a sporting event,

63
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,507
and just how exuberant you felt, right.

64
00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:00,314
Just to get yourself into that peak state of mind, right.

65
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,750
Just kinda think back and reflect, to get yourself into

66
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,083
your genius zone creative state of mind.
