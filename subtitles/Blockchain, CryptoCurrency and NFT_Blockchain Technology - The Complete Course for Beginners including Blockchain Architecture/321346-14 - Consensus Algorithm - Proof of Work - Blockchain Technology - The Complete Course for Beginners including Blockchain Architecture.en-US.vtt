00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
hello.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.310
In this lecture,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.510
we are going to cover a very,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.240
very important concept.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.550
Off proof off work consensus are regarded them.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's see a brief off the history off proof off work I got to them.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.640
Hash Cash is one of the oldest proof off work algorithm that was used for spam email

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.250
detection.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.850
The original idea was proposed in 1992 which was letter proposed as hash cash in 1997.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.250
This algorithm adds ah hash cast tam to the email header,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.980
which requires some amount of computation ranging from few milliseconds up to a particular

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.950
second depending upon the processing power.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.050
However,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.550
what ensures is one cannot send millions off emails from a small server,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.250
which is where the spammers try to do.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.450
Whether coming back to the proof off work in a block shin environment.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.050
As this is the consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.200
we will be talking Maurin terms off Bitcoin on Bitcoin mining process in this particular

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.710
lecture.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.640
Now let's assume that all nodes in the Blockchain are allowed to create a block at the same

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.380
time that would lead to chaos,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.810
as we would not know which block and which transactions are the authentic ones that may

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.020
also lead to double spending.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.350
So then how do we choose the Nord that is allowed to add a block to the Blockchain?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.530
Satoshi solved this problem by using the Proof Off work algorithm as part of block creation

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.530
.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350
The unspent transactions are recorded in a block,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.240
but before any,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.250
nor is allowed to create that block on a sign few Bitcoins to him.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.720
It is presented with some cryptographic puzzle on.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.650
Once this puzzle is revealed,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.200
a race begins on the one who solves the puzzle gets to create the block in the block shin.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.350
They can also add a new transaction that will award new Bitcoins to them.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.730
This process is also called as mining as it creates new Bitcoins Onda.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.150
Once the miner nor solves the puzzle it broadcasts it to its peers would invalidates the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.450
solution to the puzzle as well as the transactions within the bloc.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.910
On if it is indeed the correct answer,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.150
on upon 51% rallied et the miner nor gets to our that block in the block chip.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.520
So what is this puzzle on how it works?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.580
Let's try to understand that using a simple Dies.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.250
Example.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.990
The puzzle here is to come up with a combination off two Dies,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.910
which will sum up to seven.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.890
You may throw the dice,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.750
and it could be two plus three.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.150
That's five and not equal to seven.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.250
You may try it again on May Come up with eight as an answer.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.020
Maybe in the third attempt,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.050
you will get a combination off four and three,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.850
which is the correct answer.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:31.150
Now imagine a scenario where there are multiple participants who are competing to come up

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.650
with the answer to this puzzle.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.650
Then whoever gets the right combination off the dies post become Zilina.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.580
The real world hashing puzzle is not so simple,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.850
though.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.880
In case or Bitcoin,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.850
every new block will have the hash off the previous block.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.050
Few transactions included in that block on it also has something called as the knowns.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.450
This is a random number that gets added or con coordinated to the transactions that the nor

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.950
wants to add to the block.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.300
The mining Nord is then asked to find the norms in such a manner that the resultant hash

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.250
off this combined string is less than a particular value.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.560
What that means is it will have some leading zeros smaller,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.030
this value or more.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.550
The number off leading zeros higher will be the difficult level to solve the hash puzzle.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.750
There is actually no definite answers to how many attempts it might take to solve it.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.860
Due to the randomness off this puzzle by the Terry off probability,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.450
even a small computer may have a chance to find the lawns,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.750
though it will have a very,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.350
very low.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:54.360
Probably I have actually created a few nuances on provided you the degree of difficulty to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.150
find them.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.650
All right.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.210
What I have here is,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.480
let's say agitation on some con captain ated string off numbers which together represent

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.550
the block content.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.120
The task here is now to find a number such that it will have a September off leading zeros

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.120
.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.750
As you can see,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.330
it took me seven attempts to come up with this hash for a difficulty.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.930
Level off one leading zero as the number of leading zeros increased.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:40.850
The number off attempts also increased exponentially from 7 to 438 to 6134 and finally

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.700
reaching 2.79 million for five,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.750
leading zeros.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:53.150
This has taken closed toe a minute for my laptop computer with eight leading zeros.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.450
It might take hundreds off millions off attempt to find out the lawns number.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.040
Though it is so competition Aly intensive to come up with the right nonce number,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.250
It is actually very easy to verify.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:15.250
Let's say the mining Nord has produced all these hashes and claims that this is the nonce

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.740
value for this particular hash.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:25.510
Now let's go to the high generator and see whether it tallies with this particular value or

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.050
not,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.550
we now know how to search and go to chart 256 hash generators.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.650
Andi Here I am.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:42.860
Let's simply copy and fast the number that will show the hash generated with this nonce

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.350
value.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.640
Let's add the number one well,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.820
it does not produce the hash with one leading zero,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:57.110
so we increased to nothing happens then 23 Still,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:03.150
we don't have the specified leading zeros for this hash with this string,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:10.270
so it has taken me 2.8 million attempts on one minute off computing time to find out the

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.380
correct Nam's.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.050
It will hardly take a second to very fight.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:23.090
So what I do is I simply best the string on the exact number,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:29.580
which is 2790560 at the end of it on,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.550
There you go.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.820
It has produced a hash,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.050
which is with five leading zeros.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.280
With this,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.580
you can very fight easily whether the North,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.730
which claims to have solved the puzzle,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.750
is telling as the truth or not.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:50.450
The rial Nords used the same shot 256 algorithm to generate the hash on Very Fight.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:58.680
I hope that makes it clear on how the proof off work in the context off Bitcoin works to

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.660
summarize it.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.450
The process off proof off work is known as mining in case off Bitcoin.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.850
The proof is hard to create but easy to verify.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.850
It's like a combination lock.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.920
It's very difficult to get the combination,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.860
but once you know it,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.210
it simply takes one.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.150
Try to find out if the lock opens with that combination or not.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.200
As more and more notes joined the network,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.650
they bring in more computational powers.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.230
That's increasing.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.690
The difficulty level on has become competition.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.590
Aly very,

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.650
very intensive,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.540
I need not say,

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.750
but it is acceptable to 51% attack,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:49.740
as it will take Nords with 51% computational power to verify even a wrong puzzle that

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.680
concludes the lecture on proof or for consensus,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.370
unguarded them.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.330
I hope you have enjoyed learning this very,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.150
very challenging topic in the block shape.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.150
Thank you so much for joining me in this lecture.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.050
And I will see you in the next one.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.130
Until then,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.450
enjoy your time.
