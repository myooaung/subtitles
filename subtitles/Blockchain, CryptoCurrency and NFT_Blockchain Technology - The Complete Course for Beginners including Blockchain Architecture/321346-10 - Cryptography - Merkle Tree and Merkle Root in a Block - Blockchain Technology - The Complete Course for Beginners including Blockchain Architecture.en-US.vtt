00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
hi.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.340
In one of the previous lectures,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.330
we saw Ah,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.450
high level view off the block and its structure.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.580
However,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.200
there are few more terms that we should be family away.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.700
When we talk about the block structure,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.320
we know that a block stores its own hash as well as the actual the previous block does.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.550
It forms a chain.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.500
The bloc also has the timestamp off.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.920
Then it was created.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.650
The block height is nothing,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.790
but the position of the block in the Blockchain and the knowns is nothing but an arbitrary

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.650
number that can only be used once during ah cryptographic communication.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.050
We will see it in action during the Proof off work lecture and I will actually show you and

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.350
give you some examples off the nonce.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.550
And how the proof or for works.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.710
Let's get to the main topic of this lecture,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.750
which is the Merkel tree on its definition.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.100
Ah,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.310
hash tree or a marco tree is a tree off hashes off the data blocks or defies or set off

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.150
files which may contain multiple transactions within that block.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.940
All right,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.950
the Markle route is the top most hash off all the transactions on their respective hashes.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.120
It has been invented and patented by Rolls Markel.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.650
It allows very efficient and secure verification off the content within a large data

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.050
structure such as a block.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.450
Let's try to understand that by visualizing how the Markle Treat is formed,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.150
let's say you have these eight transactions even until D eight,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.050
which are going to be part of the Blockchain.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.220
First,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.150
we create the hashes off this transaction.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.750
Let's say that you want to catch it.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.750
Next,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080
we create the hash off.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.520
These two hash is such that the resultant hash is hash 12 for hash off,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.730
one on hash off to on we go on creating a binary tree until we find the hash.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.410
123456 and seven,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.150
which is nothing but the Markle route off this particular binary tree,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.150
and this route is what gets stored inside the block.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.650
So now if someone wants to change a particular transaction within a particular block,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.050
that will cause the Merkel route off that block to change.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.740
This will also change the block hash.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.480
There's Marcal Route acts as the double security for the data,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.920
as well as the transactions within the Blockchain It also preserves the integrity off

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.050
thousands off transactions within that block ends.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.030
It's such an important element within a block.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.690
Shame that's all for this lecture on Marco Tree on.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.250
Thank you so much for joining me and your your time.
