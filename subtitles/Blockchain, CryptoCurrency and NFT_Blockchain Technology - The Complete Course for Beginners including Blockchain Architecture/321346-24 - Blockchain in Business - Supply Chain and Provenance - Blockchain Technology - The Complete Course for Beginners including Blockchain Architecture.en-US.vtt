00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
hi Blockchain,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.730
as we know,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.250
is a revolutionary technology that is transforming many industries.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.880
In this lecture,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.950
let's see how it can help solve problems as well as optimize some of the processes in

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.410
supply.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.500
Chin on.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.650
Help us build the provenance through the same.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.300
Let's first try and understand how the supply Jin works with an example off one of the most

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.650
expensive items in the trade that is diamond.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.700
The diamond mines are concentrated in certain countries such as Australia,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.700
South Africa,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.450
Russia on not America.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.460
Cutting and polishing off the raw diamond happen in countries such as India,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.130
China,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.650
Belgium and Russia.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.670
Veras,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.900
digitally manufacturers as well as the retailer's off diamonds might be from a completely

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.950
different country.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.150
Let's see different steps involved from diamond mining to the retail buyer.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.660
The raw diamond from the minds is traded on,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.450
then sent to cutting and polishing units,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
which then goes to diamond margin trading houses.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.390
These diamonds are then sold to diamond retailers,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.850
where you can buy them as God diamonds or maybe to Julie manufacturing units.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.670
These units then manufacturer various jewelries such as rings or necklaces,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.350
are such the manufacturing units sells them to the dealers and finally to the retailer's.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440
As we have seen,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.350
most of these activities are spread across the globe.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.420
The diamond industry max use off various means off transport,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.520
including airfreight,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.800
secure vans,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.540
etcetera.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.750
To move these diamonds from one step to another.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.260
At all of these steps,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.650
it's important to make sure that the correct quality and the quantity is maintained as well

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.190
as the process is followed Trust.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.500
Transparency on the workflow tracking becomes very essential in case off such a high value

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.950
trade as diamond on any fault in any off,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.350
these can be a very costly mistake.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.270
The block chain can record all the transactions on a public leisure from mining to retail

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.250
in an impeachable fashion.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.850
Numerous paper intensive processes can be transformed into a distributed ledger.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.120
It also ensures transparency as all the participants in such a Blockchain will be able to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.910
get a complete history off the diamond,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.450
right from the mining source to the hands off the end customers.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.580
The Blockchain technology,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.040
when used for diamond trade,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.850
can significantly enhance the efficiency on security off the supply chain.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.030
Also,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.570
consumers can buy with confidence.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.860
In fact,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.650
every ledger is one such company which has so far digitally stored over 1.6 million

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.350
diamonds.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.550
DBS has recently announced the development off a diamond Blockchain for the entire industry

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.550
.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.130
Though I have explained this using the example of diamond trade,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.150
it can be applied in almost all kinds off supply chains,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.200
whether it is Unilever,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.870
which wants to use Blockchain to manage de supply from Malawi,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.810
a small country in Africa,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.580
or the Walmart,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.550
which tested the Blockchain for food safety.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.240
Oh,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.310
or even a major partnership between IBM and Mosque,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.450
which plans to create a Blockchain for the global supply chain.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.850
Blockchain is making inroads in all forms off supply gin.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.250
It sounds great and very overwhelming.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.510
Blockchain in supply chain,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.230
however,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.050
solves one more problem,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.550
which is Providence.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.830
Providence is nothing but the chronology or record off the ownership custody our location

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.250
off a historical object.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.130
It has been used mostly in the context off rear items such as riel,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.080
artifacts,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.010
paintings,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.040
historical documents or acts,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.950
as well as some really rare wines.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.900
How we watch we all are very much concerned with the authenticity off the product that we

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.450
use are consumed.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.430
We might be interested to know how a particular farm produce has been served on our dining

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.920
table,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.190
though it might sound like a far fetched idea.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.050
I want to remind you off the spinach outbreak in the United States in 2006.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.040
It started in September 2006.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.590
On within a month,

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.450
there were 1 99 people who were infected.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.150
Three died on 30 Once afford kidney failure off a particular type,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.750
it took the FDA two weeks to trace to a farm in California.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.810
Now,

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.250
if we can use Blockchain for this Providence,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.250
we can trees products in matter off sections on take action,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.850
which can save lives.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:40.440
The ever leisure are the Blockchain db EOS may help us prevent the blood diamonds coming

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.610
into the trade innocents.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.330
Blockchain not only improves visibility off the product across the supply chain,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.150
but also managers work flows better.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.290
It can lead to optimize,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.050
invent tree on finance.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.120
It also guarantees greater trust on then assure quality.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.350
I hope that explains how blocked in can be used across the supply chain as well as for

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.050
Providence.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.960
That's all for this lecture.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.010
See you soon in the next one.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.020
Until then,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.450
enjoy your time
