00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
hi we have seen so far how the Blockchain is set to transform the supply chain on Provident

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.150
.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.640
We also saw how the property market can be ready till changed using block shin when we

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.140
started smart contracts.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.650
Well,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.650
finance is one such field which touches our lives directly.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.850
How can it remains immune to Blockchain?

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.950
In fact,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.550
Bitcoin is an example off how it radically changed the payment systems.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.160
Let's go back to the example off how you purchase this cause we now know how the

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.550
transaction was routed through the multiple authorities.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.550
They acted as trusted parties in their own right.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.260
But it does lead to duplication off.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.060
Effort on is pretty expensive.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.820
Overall,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.950
due to third party fees,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.150
add is not very secure.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.590
We have seen so many hacks where the credit card data has been stolen from these central

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.450
authorities.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.550
Also,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.080
typically it takes anywhere between 1 to 3 days for you,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.650
to me to receive this money in their account which means it's not fast enough is deep.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.660
If we had to pay using a Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.360
all we needed to do Waas simply send Bitcoins to the your enemies recipient address through

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.350
the Blockchain off course.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.840
This would have attracted some fees from the minor nodes,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.120
but that would have been very lays compared to the fees charged by the trusted parties in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.810
the traditional payment system.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.010
Let's take a slightly more complex example off how the block shin as a whole can transform

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.250
the international treat.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.860
The international trade involves almost all types off financial services,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.050
such as payments guarantees insurance on Sean.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.720
In this case,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.150
we have an important on an exporter on they are trading certain goods.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:17.000
These goods are shipped across the ocean by a shipper or cargo company like let's say,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.890
for example,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.550
more risk.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.610
Usually,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.780
the exporter will always have a banker in his home country,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.410
and similarly,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.750
the importers will be dealing with a bank in its own country.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.510
The exporters will certainly sign a contract with the shipper to ship the goods the shipper

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.240
needs to get the confirmation from the important on pass it on to the exporter once the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.250
goods are delivered.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.730
The exporter also typically has an insurance agreement with an insurer for the goods in

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.520
transit,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.050
as well as any non payment risks that he may see.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.250
The important may provide a bank guarantee off payment to the exporters.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.350
The exporter then submits this to his bankers.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.130
The two banks will now have to deal with an agreement which they have entered into with

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.900
their respective customers,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.350
which are exporter on Important.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.130
At the same time,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.210
every party needs to keep a record off the agreement they entered into along with their

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.850
rights and obligations.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:41.940
Certainly we now have a long list off agreements that need to be kept track off for one

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.400
single shipment in this digital world,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.650
even though the delivery off messages might happen very quickly.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.650
Various verifications in the manual on paper form,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.350
I cross this network could delay the payment from important toe exporter.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.360
It could even be couple off months at times on.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.250
Believe me,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.430
this does happen almost every time off.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.450
New shipment is to be delivered.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.050
A Blockchain with a smart contract can solve this problem with much ease.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.760
The smart contract can lives down.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.070
All the parties are participants,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.250
along with their duties and obligations.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.550
This will form a long list off if then else statements.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.110
So when the exporters shipped the goods,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.890
he can add the transaction details for the same As the cargo company shapes the goods,

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.950
it can add the transactions at every stage until it finally reaches the importer.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.750
While this is happening on as the exporter gets into the insurance agreement,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.670
the premium do will automatically be part off these smart contract shipment aunt on a pre

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.040
defined condition,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.100
which could be when the goods are packed on moved to cargo facility,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.430
the banks will automatically pay the insurance company the premium that is due on behalf

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.450
off the customers.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.350
The importer,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.180
upon receiving the goods,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.250
updates these transactions,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.750
which then triggers the payment due to the exporters.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.250
The exporter's bank can now demand the payment for the goods.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.910
The borders bank will promptly detect that amount from the importance account on send it to

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.960
the exporter's bank or the Blockchain.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.170
Address the mutability off the data.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.630
I'm the ability to change the state by the respective parties will ensure the legitimacy

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.950
off the transactions.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:57.130
The Blockchain can change the international trade finance from ah high cost on long

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.460
turnaround time to a low cost and short,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.790
or should I say very short turnaround time in case off financial services and banking,

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.310
the Blockchain can be very effective in case off identity management so that we don't have

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.930
to go through the same registration on verification processes.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:26.950
With every institute for also storing the digital assets on various financial contracts,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.760
the Blockchain can be very,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.650
very useful.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:37.300
It can also be used in lending transfers and payments for X on investments in case off

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.640
lending the verified identity as well as stored personal data can be enough to grant are

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.850
reject alone.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.460
Even after this Bussmann,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:55.110
the smart contract between the bank and the data can make sure that the repayment off the

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.130
loan happens.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.450
As per the terms,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:04.480
Blockchain offers huge benefits in terms off reduced disputes in payments.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.410
As the smart contract can go on.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:14.730
The entire agreement with the built in consensus mechanism so nobody can believe and to

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.310
making a particular payment are even delay our dishonor,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.980
a payment that is due to you as introduces various third parties,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.310
it significantly reduces the transaction fees on,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.050
hence the overall cost off transaction.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.510
The really used turnaround time.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.740
Our that means the reduced cost off delayed payment.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.530
It could be used in terms off interest costs.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.850
It also brings in huge efficiency into the system.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.720
I hope you have no understood how blocked and can be used in finance.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.450
In a nutshell.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:58.300
I hope you have enjoyed understanding all these applications on how Blockchain can

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.850
transform the financial world as we see today.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.360
That's all I have for this lecture.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.990
See you in the next one.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.840
Until then,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.550
enjoy your time.
