00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
hi.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.640
Among many of the applications of Blockchain de app are decentralized applications are one

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.250
of the most powerful and with far reaching consequences.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.900
Before we try to understand the D.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.430
APs,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:22.240
let's go back and look at how traditional application is deployed on Executed at a very

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.090
high level.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.580
In a traditional application,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.550
you have a client which communicates to the back end through an interface or set off logic

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.870
This application can be hosted on one server or on multiple servers,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.550
.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.130
but essentially they are controlled by one entity in case off a decentralized app.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.860
They are Software programs that run on a peer to peer network on are not controlled by

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.050
single entity.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.410
However,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.520
a Blockchain animal decentralized application shares some characteristics off Blockchain,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.350
which makes them unique.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.250
They are basically decentralized applications installed on peer to peer network.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.430
We know that the second most important characteristic is that they are based on

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.220
decentralized but consensus based network and as it is backed by Blockchain,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.050
it guarantees the mutability off source scored.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.550
So no single nor can tamper with the application so scored on there is no censorship.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.390
Also the D APS running on public P two P Network such as it Terry um,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.700
where the nodes are spread all over the globe.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.550
It can never be shut down on There is literally no downtime.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.490
Let's also try to bring together the D APS and smart contracts as they are very easy to be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.370
confused with.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:05.220
The ABS are not smart contract as these applications are run on p two p network and can be

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.950
accessed using Internet.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.300
Let's say they are.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.600
Reporters are Web application on Let's see how they are different than traditional portals

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.850
or websites.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.840
In case off a traditional website,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.770
you have a front end returning HTML or other scripting languages,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.250
such as Java script it connects to the date of is through some sort off an interface.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.650
The ABS are very much similar to traditional applications.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.350
There is no difference in the front end,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.530
however.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.190
Instead,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.910
off traditional interface,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.640
the front end communicates with the block chain using smart contracts.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.180
The interface also has all the necessary logic that requires the D up to function as

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.850
desired.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.090
The D App does developed has to meet certain criteria before we can call it a block.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.650
India.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.130
It has to be completely open.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.710
Source only then the source scored can be managed.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.150
Using consensus based protocol,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.950
it must use cryptography for storing data as well as for communication protocol.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.350
Andi,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.090
as the Blockchain notes,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.750
compete for rewards in the form off new tokens or transaction fee.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.850
Every block Chandi app must use a cryptographic token,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.140
Andi for it to use tokens.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.230
It should also generate tokens in some way or the other de app off for multiple benefits

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.850
over traditional applications.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.910
As we discussed earlier,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.380
it provides a mutability off application source scored on.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.550
No third party can tamper with the court on its own as it is distributed globally.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.300
It's can't be shut down.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.050
So you have washed your zero downtime.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.570
The skill ability is never an issue with D.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.010
Abbs,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.520
as they are built to scale with thousands off Nords on appear to be a network with the use

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.630
off cryptography.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.740
On Blockchain,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.050
we get an added security over the application as well as the underlying data.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.660
All right,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.620
so you may wonder,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.310
what's the process off building such a DEA?

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.070
Well,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.650
it's not so simple as building a normal application.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.740
You first need to publish a white paper for the DEA you need to highlight the problems your

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.350
D app is going to solve.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.480
How do you plan to develop it?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.750
What are your plans to generate and distribute tokens as well as the consensus mechanism?

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.550
Don't forget to mention all the pros and cons associated with the proposed the APP.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.640
You may want to begin developing a prototype along with few years on.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.350
Once enough momentum has been gained.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.150
You can then decide to launch an initial coin offering.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.900
It's nothing but,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.110
ah,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.930
fundraising event similar to start up investments.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.780
We see this is typically followed with the development,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.400
our implementation off the app on,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.200
then the final launch off the DEA.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.720
And as the MD off dear friend stays,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.500
everything that can be decentralized will be decentralized.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.550
So the future of its us in a decentralized form.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.750
Thank you all for joining me in this lecture on the APS.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.750
See you soon in the next one
