00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
hi.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.890
In this lake church,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.850
we are going to cover one off the most important concepts off distributed consensus and

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.350
mining,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.590
as you have seen in the past lectures.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.230
In case off a centralized system,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.390
there is only one party,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.750
such as a bank,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.890
which acts as the trusted party on.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.850
We all concur with what it says,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.550
so it's very easy to achieve consensus in a centralized system.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.950
However,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.190
when we are dealing with a distributed system where the piers or the Nords have conflicting

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.470
interests on,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.070
do not necessarily trust each other,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.950
it becomes difficult to reach the consensus.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.740
So how do we build on meant in the consensus in such a system?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.950
Off distrust?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.750
Before we deep dive into how the consensus is achieved?

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.950
Let's first look at what do we mean by consensus decision making?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.810
While it may be common sense based on the family or worlds,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.120
but it's worth a while to go through it and arrive at a common understanding.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.350
As per the definition on Wikipedia,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.050
it's a group decision making process in which group members develop on agree to support our

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.950
decision in the best interest off the wall.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.810
It further defines consensus as the acceptable resolution one that can be supported even if

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.440
not the favorite,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.150
off every individual.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.700
Some may or may not agree with the decision,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.950
but the majority works for it.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.160
But that also means is the participants also need to agree on how the process off decision

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.150
making will work.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.490
This process is nothing but the consensus regarding them in case of computer systems.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.760
This is also known as a bison Tynes Generals Problem described by Leslie Lamport,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.150
Robert shows back on Marshall Peas and their 1982 paper.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.670
Let's try to understand what the problem is on Why or consensus algorithm is important in

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.620
this case,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.950
a group of generals commanding a portion off when centimes army and circles a city.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.250
The plan is to attack the city for capturing or retreat.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.550
These generals may have different opinions off whether toe attack or retreat.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.730
However,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.360
they all agree that they will go with the majority.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.050
Are common opinion as an uncoordinated attack could be disastrous.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.950
They also need to deal with the problem off traitors.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.760
A traitor general may send misleading messages to other generals on may even kill the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.900
messenger who is sending the information So if he received the message toe attack from the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.050
previous general,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.370
he may even kill the messenger on Send a message off.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.980
Retreat to other generals.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.770
The computer system analogy here is jungles are notes in the peer to peer network.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.840
On the city is the data that we are trying to validate it on.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.050
There could be traitors off malicious Lord which are trying to manipulate this system.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.590
Let's say,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.720
for example,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.760
the Trettel nor within the system sends a message toe one set off piers that it has

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.690
transferred 10 Bitcoins to John and 10 Bitcoins to Bob Veras.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.770
It actually had only 10 Bitcoins on.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.850
He's trying to double spend it.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.050
Bitcoin solve this problem by assigning a proof off work based consensus algorithm.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.640
So the no which is trying to create a block,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.570
needs to provide some proof which everyone in the network will agree on reach.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.770
A consensus on there are various algorithms on the main purpose off the consensus algorithm

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.840
is to achieve the agreement among the network participants or lords within our distributed

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.350
system.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.980
Consensus algorithm also helps us maintain the correct speed off.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.900
The later on can help prevent attack to manipulate the data as the Attackers might need

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.750
more power than the majority to manipulate the data.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.460
The different types off consensus algorithm,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.170
which are currently in use,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:07.460
are proof off work proof off stake proof off Elapsed time Simply filed Byzantine fault.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.250
Tolerance on proof off authority.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.150
Let's go through the proof off work in the next lecture,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.710
so see you soon.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.950
And that's all I have for this lecture.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.350
Thank you very much for joining me.
