00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
hi.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.060
In this shark lectures,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.200
we are going to cover the two types of block chains,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.440
namely permission.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.150
I'm permission list blocked.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.650
So what do we mean by permissions and what kind of permissions we're talking about?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.850
Well,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.550
permission Elise Bloch chains are an open house.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.950
Don't need anybody's permission to join the network.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.350
It's also known as public collection.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.650
Bitcoin ethereum are some of the examples off a public Blockchain.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.540
Because anyone can join,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.110
there is no question off knowing the participants beforehand hands.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.660
There is absolutely no trust,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.820
however.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.150
Trust gets established by means off consensus on reward for being honest.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.280
So,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.130
in a sense,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.350
it's a trust less system.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.440
On the other hand,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.820
a permission Blockchain requires pre verification off the participants.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.510
The participants are usually known to each other and play a rule in establishing some sort

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.250
off order,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.850
our application or a system.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.120
One such example could be that off supply chain,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.150
where multiple global parties transact with each other on some other examples,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.750
could be off property registration buying as villas selling.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.910
We will go through a concept off smart contract where many of these examples,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.600
as well as the terms,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.050
will be toward in depth.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.120
That's all we have in the shock lecture.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.820
Off types,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.550
off auction.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.600
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.460
And I will see you in the next lecture.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.750
Enjoy your time.
