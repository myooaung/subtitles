00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
Hi.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.980
We learned so much about the Blockchain Andi.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.020
Each principles so far in this section leads learns off the technologies that can power the

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.630
distributed ledgers on block shins.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.050
And I'm so excited to walk you through some of these technologies.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.560
The first among the distributed ledger technologies that we will learn today is the Terry.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.750
Um,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050
so what is Italian?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.260
First and foremost,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.650
it's not Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.450
It differs significantly with Bitcoin and its poor pulls on what it can do.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.150
Bitcoin is simply one off the applications off Blockchain technology.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.950
It's simply appear to be a network off electronic payments.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.390
It Terry um,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.830
was first proposed by Metallic battalion in 2013.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.450
I hope I'm pronouncing the name correctly.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.650
It's an open source software development platform based on Blockchain technology.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.980
At allows developers to build decentralized application using scripts or what we know now

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.650
as smart contracts.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.760
Andi,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.020
as seen in the previous lectures,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.500
a smart contract is nothing but a computer court that self operates on executes when

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.250
certain conditions are met.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.740
Similar to Bitcoin,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.570
Italian uses eater as its Cryptocurrency with the miners mind on is also used as a reward

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.550
or compensation to various types off participants.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.490
It arian based smart contracts can potentially decentralized almost every centralized

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.060
application such as property porches and registry insurance.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.280
Supply chain on many,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.690
many more without spending much time.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.950
Let's jump to the Ethereum technology ecosystem.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.250
Well,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.540
well,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.760
well,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.850
though there are too many boxes around.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.020
Don't get overwhelmed by it,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.150
as I'm going to explain every single block over here.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.580
The aim are all of this lecture is to provide an overview off all the major components at

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.020
an architectural level.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.340
Let's see,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.720
What are those building blocks off Terry Um,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.450
architecture.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.550
Get is the official client software provided by Italian Foundation.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.050
It acts as a north on can download and copy the entire Blockchain.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.690
It's a complete nor in the sense that it has the ability to mind the blocks as well as our

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.720
transactions to the Blockchain.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.830
It also communicates continuously with other notes which could be get or something else.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.550
We will see those in just a few seconds.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.850
Get is return in the co programming language.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.070
It also comes with its own graphical user interface.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.160
Known as missed browser.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.710
It is used to communicate with the get north,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.760
similar to get.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.350
You have an unofficial client software called Parity,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.390
which comes with its own parity browser.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.930
Aunt has more or less the same functionality as get it's written in the rest programming

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:33.550
language.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.490
You can also use JavaScript Library Web Three Gorges to connect on a contract with the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.850
North.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.650
You can build their applications using Web Tree.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.550
Metta Mosque is another client software that can be used to connect with the North.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.850
It's essentially a crumb plug in that contract with the Italian North.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.750
The key difference here is you don't host the North at your end.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.350
The North is hosted and owned by Metta Mask.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.610
All you need to do is download and install the mental mosque software on you are ready to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.250
communicate.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.840
Apart from these two leading Italian clients,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.740
there are multiple such clients.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.280
Return for different language,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.160
supports CPP.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.510
Terry,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.000
Um is the Terry um C plus plus language client,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.530
while the buy it APP is the +14 fightin similarly that are Terry um J for Java.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.590
Ruby Terry,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.800
um,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.050
for the Ruby language on so on.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.700
That's in a nutshell are different Nords and clients offers,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.250
which are available for Ethereum development.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.850
The next component off the Terry M ecosystem is the Italian virtual machine.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.550
I don't see this as a separate item or block.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.120
It's nothing but a software which acts as the runtime environment for smart contracts.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.450
It runs on every Italian nor in the network.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.620
These virtual machines have been implemented in various languages.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.450
Such a jiao R C plus plus go ruby grassed,

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.050
etcetera.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.660
One important piece of this puzzle is also the E.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.050
N s or Italian naming system.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.250
It's very family or to the DNS or domain naming system.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.200
In case off Deanna's,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.950
we simply map the i p address with a human understandable world.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.420
Similarly,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.490
and Ian s can redirect you to a particular the so in an Italian browser if you type

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.920
property contract dot e t etch as looming.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.250
This is the name of the APP.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.150
It will open the respective applications.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.850
All right,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.230
at the bottom.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.550
Here we see these two blocks which appear like some sort off appear to be a network.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.500
Well,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.160
indeed they are.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.150
Let's look at what swarm is.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.650
The swarm network is a decentralized storage and distribution service.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.520
And why do we need that?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.070
Well,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.450
Blockchain is good to store some small information.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.350
But what if we want to store and also make it publicly available?

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.680
Then the Blockchain won't be sufficient on may even be very,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.450
very expensive to do so.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.550
Swarm is the solution for this.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.760
It's a network off large number of computers over the Internet unit to run a swarm Nord toe

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.750
connect to this particular network.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.350
All right,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:50.050
The I P fs are interplanetary file system that you see here is very similar to swarm.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.760
It's also are distributed file storage system.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.780
However,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.660
swarm is an Italian specific project there,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.350
as I PFS is not,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.390
but it has close ties with Terry.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.550
Um,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.010
typically,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.780
you will store the hash off a large file which will point toe either storm or IBF s for

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.450
storage or retriever.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.550
When more technology piece in this puzzle is Vesper,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.550
this part is simply our communication protocol for the APS to communicate among each other

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.550
.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:32.660
I hope by now you have the high level architecture off how the Ethereum network works on

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.050
how the front end the Nords as well as the storage on distribution in the Terri.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.230
Um,

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.750
works.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.430
That's all we have for this lecture.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.720
See you soon in the next one with another Blockchain technology.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.150
Enjoy your time
