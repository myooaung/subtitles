00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
high.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.640
In the previous lecture,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.450
we saw various components off a block.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.290
Because Blockchain also stores records,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.850
it's very easy to get it confused with a data storage like relational databases I've ever

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.750
Blockchain.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.240
Technology has some key differences with the database.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.060
Technology databases mostly stores the data.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.950
In one central repository,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.200
you can have multiple copies off the database,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.880
but essentially they are controlled by one authority,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.550
such as a database administrators.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.750
Anybody else has access to data based on the permission levels.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.080
Also,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.950
you can always modify our even deleted the data in a database.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.550
If you have the required permission,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.650
that's not the case with Blockchain.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.350
Blockchain is a right only data structure.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.390
You can only create new entries off.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.750
The records on modification is read in relation to the transaction history.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.540
Every new block that is created is appended or change with the previous block by means off

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.480
hash,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.350
as we have seen in the previous lectures.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.430
Also,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.550
there is no single administrator that can modify or delete the data.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.350
I hope that clears the differences between a database on Blockchain technology.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.460
You can pause the video here on go through these points on this slide toe Recap.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.100
The key differences between database on Blockchain So far we have learned what is a block

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.850
in a Blockchain.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.050
What is a Blockchain on its key characteristics?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.250
And we also learned the key differences between database on Block Shin in this lecture.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.340
In the next lecture,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.350
let's learn about different types of block chains such as permission,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.350
permission less and so on.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.850
Thank you so much for joining me in this lecture and have a great time.
