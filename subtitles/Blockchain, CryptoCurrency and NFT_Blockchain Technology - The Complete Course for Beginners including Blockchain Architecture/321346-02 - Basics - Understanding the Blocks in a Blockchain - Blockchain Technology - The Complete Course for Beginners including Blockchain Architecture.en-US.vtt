00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
Hi.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.310
We heard a lot of our d block shin on what?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.550
All things it can do.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.660
But before we deep dive into the Blockchain on,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.400
see how it works in various scenarios,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.050
along with the technology behind it,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.350
Let's first try to understand what is a block in a block chin.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.880
It's very important to understand what goes in a block and what items are included in a

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.150
block.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.920
In essence,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.150
every block in a Blockchain content three primary items.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.850
It contains some data,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.750
the hash off the block and the hash of the previous broke.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.150
Well,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.240
the data can be a set off transactions.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.520
It can be some contractual information,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.350
or it could be a payment transaction.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.300
It will typically have details such as who is the initiator of the transaction or by whom

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.450
the transaction has been created.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.020
Then it will also have who is the beneficiary or the recipient off the transaction,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.650
as well as the details off that particular transaction.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.700
In case off a crypto currency like Bitcoin,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.330
it could be the number off Bitcoins and the purpose off it in case off a Blockchain for

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.190
property.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.070
It could be the property details as well as the transaction details such as mortgage or

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.080
rent payment.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.650
It's a truck,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.050
remember,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.550
Blockchain is not Bitcoin and Blockchain is not Cryptocurrency.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.450
We will get into the details off each of these in just a few lectures.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.050
Always right,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.350
So the next is the hash of the block.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.140
So what is a hash?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.550
The hash is usually generated using some cryptographic techniques.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.940
We will go to the photography in the next few lectures.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.200
But for now,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.050
please remember that the hash is nothing but the unique identity off that particular block

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.510
we have identities such as our Social Security numbers are the retina scan our our

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.530
fingerprints,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.650
which are unique to us.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.070
Similarly,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.250
the cryptographic hash is the unique identity fire for a particle block.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.550
The hash will change if we try to update any information within the bloc.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.920
And using this,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.050
we make sure that the data inside is tamper proof.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.950
All right.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.290
However,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.020
in this example,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:55.450
we have simply taken the next later in the alphabetical series and formed new words soul.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.370
Someone who does not understand how it has been formed will never know what it means.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:11.150
This is a very basic example on Blockchain technologies uses very advance cryptography,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.650
which is almost impossible to break in a given time frame.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.350
The next element in a block is the previous hash off the block.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.650
It acts as the reference All pointers,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.680
which then creates a chain on.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.500
Hence,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.700
the name is blocked in.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.310
So if we try to change any content of the block,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.700
it will cause the hash to change,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.550
which means the block will no longer view valid.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.620
Why?

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.950
Because we will have to change all these subsequent logs on their hashes,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.460
which is going to be time consuming on impossible for one,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.850
nor or one computer to do it.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.150
This is how it makes it impossible to tamper the data in a Blockchain.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.250
We will look into some of these aspect in more details as we go through the course in the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.250
next lecture.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.050
Let's see,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.950
what are the different characteristics off a Blockchain
