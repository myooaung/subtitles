00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
hi.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.020
Among the many applications of Blockchain we learned about the Bitcoins and how it works in

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.150
the previous lectures.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.440
Another such application of the Blockchain,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.350
which is going to have a far reaching impact,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.750
is smart contract.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.250
So what is a smart contract?

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.110
Well,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.750
it was first proposed by Necks Abu in 1994.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.350
Nick is a computer scientist legal scholar on her cryptography expert.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.600
He proposed that the real contracts can actually be put into a computer protocol that can

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.750
execute the terms of the contract.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.850
So there is actually no difference between a smart contract on a physical contract.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.460
It's just that there are no third parties on the contract.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.730
Terms get executed automatically.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.050
Once a set off conditions are met,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.250
it can be visualized as a computer program inside a block shin.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.370
Well,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.500
let's try to understand what is a smart contract on how it works.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.350
Using the example off buying a house.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.850
Typically we will search for a house using various requirements we have.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.160
Then we finalize the one on.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.550
We knew she ate the price as well as the terms and conditions off the purchase agreement

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.250
with the particular house owners.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.190
This is then also followed by various checks with the property registry to determine the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.750
true ownership as well as the history off that particular property.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.350
The new agreement will also be registered with the government registry.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.310
This involves lots of paperwork on There is always an element off fraud that many people

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.550
have encountered.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.550
Now imagine if we have the property records created on a Blockchain.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.380
There is no need to go through the registry because the Blockchain by ex principal can very

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.750
easily verify the true ownership off the property.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.450
If the details have already been added to the Blockchain all right now,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.770
once the ownership as well as other details off the property are very fired using

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.570
Blockchain,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:37.270
A smart contract which is nothing but a set off rules created in the digital form,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.950
gets applied.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.590
It will then trigger the automatic execution off payments sequences to be paid at different

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.550
intervals.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.490
Any change in the ownership sequence,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.760
either in percentage with multiple owners,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.900
are a single 100%.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.340
Membership will also be triggered Andi.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.650
If the buyer has taken a loan from the bank,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:16.600
it can also are the mortgage secrets or transaction details to this smart contract such a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.010
contract then becomes part off the block chain.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.550
Upon verification.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.370
Beyond this,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.110
as a set off condition is met,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.480
it triggers the matching action associated with the rules or conditions mentioned in the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.750
smart contract.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.520
Andi as it becomes part of the Blockchain it's will derive the Blockchain properties off

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.150
data mutability Andi will be part off are distributed ledger.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.390
That means nobody can tamper with your data on.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.950
Everybody can also see the contract execution.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:07.630
This will ensure create amount off transparency in any terms or contract that we are going

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.450
to execute.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.120
So in a sense,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.080
it's a simple computer program which has got a set off executable actions based on if this

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.080
,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.150
then do that type off statements.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.950
It's also a language for modification off leisure transactions.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.560
In doing so,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.140
it's also fascinated the exchange off values such as property are shares for are some off

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.750
money.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.540
We execute multiple contracts on a daily basis,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.040
such as buying a property buying shares.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.650
Multiple parties collaborate to cool here an item from one country to another.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.750
The insurance policy repurchased is also a contract which say's you are going to pay the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.550
premium on a fixed date.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.150
But if there is an accident,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.650
you will be paid the claim amount.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.210
Smart contracts could change the way we prepared negotiate on execute contracts in the near

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.850
future.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.050
That's all I have for this lecture on smart contract.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.550
See you soon.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
And I hope you have enjoyed learning smart contracts.
