00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
Hi.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.950
So by now you have understood what is a Blockchain how it works.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.850
Various technology platforms on also the challenges associated with the Blockchain.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.120
Now,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.550
if you need to evaluate and consider whether you should use the Blockchain in your

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.040
organization on on some new initiatives,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.350
how will you do it?

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.390
Well,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.350
I will try to provide you with a simple guide that could be useful in making this decision

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.340
Well,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.350
.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.180
it's just a guide on a rule off Tom in many other educational courses and contains you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.850
might have seen some decision flow chart for Blockchain evaluation our village.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.580
I like to keep it slightly different on weigh them on their marriage than simply yes,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.950
no type off answers.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.920
So what other factors that could be the deciding factor to choose the auction.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.480
I have divided them in the favourable.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.650
I'm not favorable decision points.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.540
Well,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.630
if you're using a shared and common date of its,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950
you should consider using Blockchain every word.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.950
That's just one point.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.120
You should also check if they are going to be multiple participants or writers to the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.650
system.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.090
In this case,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.250
I'm actually referring to those writers which could be beyond your control,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.350
such as vendors or any third party.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.340
That basically means participants could be unknown to you on.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.750
You cannot always trust them are the participants would have conflicting interests.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.550
You may need to consider Blockchain if you have already established the need for

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.150
cryptography for some other security purpose.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.720
It's also advisable to use the Blockchain if the business process to Manu played.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.350
The data has long turnaround time.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.950
Lastly,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.660
though the current systems maintained order trail,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.740
it is very easy to manipulate the same as Block Shen is a right only technology.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.770
Audie Trail is built into it hands.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.650
If there is a need to do the audit trails objectively,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.550
Blockchain is always recommended.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.250
Now let's see the decision.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.310
Factors which could prevent you from using Blockchain if you are using confidential data

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.830
such as Social Security numbers or health record or such a public Blockchain is definitely

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.700
not recommended are in case when you are going to store the data.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.320
With some third party,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.580
you may want to explore permission Blockchain,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.450
while making sure that you comply with the existing regulations and laws related to

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.950
confidential information.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.450
Blockchain is used,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.470
particularly when the data is continuously changing its spade for mostly studying data,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.990
Blockchain is on over co.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.150
And hence not recommended.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.590
If the rules within the system require continuous changes depending upon the business and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.170
warm in,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.850
it's not recommended to use Blockchain.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.990
As the smart contract that is governing the rules would require frequent changes on it will

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.750
be very difficult to keep track off.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.150
Many times there are simpler alternatives available.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.950
There is no need to be emotional or married to a particular technology.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.410
If a simpler solution is available,

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.850
we should always implement the same.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.840
Even this checklist is not a yes,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.650
no checklist.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.310
I would rather suggest that you provide different wage to these points,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.610
depending upon what's more important in a given situation or business operating environment

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.440
based on the same.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.710
If the weighted score is more than 70% for the Blockchain only,

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.550
then go for it.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.750
All right.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.190
I hope by now you have learned enough to make a wise decision on whether to use the block

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.050
shin or not.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.150
And if you need to,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.310
you're also aware off various technology options that are available with a fair degree off

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.120
architectural understanding That brings us to the end of this lecture.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.450
Thank you so much for joining me here.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.350
Have a great time ahead
