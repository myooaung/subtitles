00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
Hello and welcome to this course.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:10.340
This course aims to create a solid foundation before you embark on your future journey in

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.550
Blockchain technology.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.670
Unlike a long list off lectures,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.550
this course has been divided into multiple sections for structured understanding off the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.810
Blockchain technology.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.620
We will slowly go from the basics all the way up toe discussing the technology architecture

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.750
off some of the leading platforms.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.700
In the second section,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.100
we will cower basics off what is a block on the Blockchain as well as various components

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.550
off it.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.940
We will also look at the concepts off distributed ledger using the example off your course

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.850
for chase.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.440
Moving further,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.090
I will try to clear how Blockchain on databases are different as well as various types off

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.950
block change.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.140
In the section off cryptography,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.420
we will see various properties off cryptography.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.970
What is encryption?

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.570
The explanation off Markle Tree and Markle route as well as different types off encryptions

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.570
,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.250
using very simple examples off safe and keys.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.770
We will then move on to some of the advanced topics off peer to peer network on how it is

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.750
different from traditional networks.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.250
We will also see what is consensus algorithm using Byzantine Generals concept.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.250
During proof off work,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.780
I will actually generate some proof off work on its hashes and show how the essential to 56

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.230
ash works by section five.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.860
You would be ready to understand how the Bitcoin works.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.360
We will also see what is a smart contract using the example off buying a house as well as

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.120
what is a decentralized application along with the process to create one.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.350
We are going to look into the reference architectures off Terry um Golda on hyper leisure

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.950
On some of the building blocks off these distributed technologies,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.560
I have added two case studies off how the Blockchain can be used in supply chin on

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.260
provenance,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.950
using diamond trade as well as in the financial services domain.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.240
Finally,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.420
we will end the course by giving you some practical advice off.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.500
What are the challenges on how to evaluate Blockchain technologies for any off your

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.150
projects?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.970
So what are we waiting for?

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.650
Let's get started
