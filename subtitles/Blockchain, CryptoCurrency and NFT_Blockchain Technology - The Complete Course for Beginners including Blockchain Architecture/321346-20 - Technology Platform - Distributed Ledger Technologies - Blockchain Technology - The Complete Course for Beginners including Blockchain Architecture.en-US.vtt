00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Hello and welcome to the new section.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.020
As you know,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.990
by now that a decentralized system has geographically separated hardware but shared

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.050
ownership off application on data.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.420
The distributed ledger technologies are D lt's an Evel OBL action or are distributed ledger

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.750
into our decentralized application.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.930
Well,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.650
it's pretty straightforward there.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.950
Let's now look at the basic component off any DLT are distributed ledger technology.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.270
It has to have some sort off data model that will capture the current state of the later on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.350
store it for future retrieval.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.860
Secondly,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.750
it has to provide a language off transaction,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.250
the language off transaction simply animals that changes to the Leijer state.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.250
It's nothing but set off instructions in some language that can create new transactions

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.660
heard on.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.060
One of the most important is that any DLT has to propose some sort of consensus mechanism

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.150
or protocol for participants to agree.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.570
Last but not the least.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.750
It has to have cryptographic security mechanism for application on data security.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.220
All right,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.540
in this section,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.150
we are going to cover some of the major distributed ledger technologies.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.300
We'll go through the Terry,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.570
um,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.150
hyper Leisure and Korda in the subsequent lecture.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.890
I'm specifically using the word dlt because not necessarily all of these technologies will

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.150
result in a block shin.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.950
More on these in the next lecture.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.050
See you soon.
