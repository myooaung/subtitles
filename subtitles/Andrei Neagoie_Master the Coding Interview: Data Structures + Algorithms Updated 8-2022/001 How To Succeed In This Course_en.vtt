1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.180
You know yourself and how you learn best.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.390
This isn't a video of me just telling you how to learn.

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.730
Instead, I want to point out some things that may help you get the most out of this course based on

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.680
how this course is structured.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.610
Think of this course as having two courses into one.

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.970
The first part right over here is the non technical aspects of the interview.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.400
These are the skills that you will use throughout your career to get a leg up from the competition and

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.380
make sure that you are able to optimize your chances of getting a well-paid job that you love.

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.960
We're going to be talking about how to get more interviews and talk about all these topics right over

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.500
here.

11
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.840
We'll also talk about non technical interview questions, the most common questions that we get asked

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.210
in an interview and how to overcome them.

13
00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.340
And then finally talk about offer and negotiation, an often overlooked skill where we talk about how

14
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.250
to handle offers and even negotiate a race.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.560
The second part of the course is all technical.

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.350
This is the really fun part of the course where we learn fundamental computer science topics that get

17
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.720
asked at some of the top companies.

18
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.150
And don't let this diagram intimidate you.

19
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.570
By the end of the course, you're going to master all these topics.

20
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.480
We're going to learn about data structures like arrays, stacks, trees, graphs, and then specific

21
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.670
ones like priority QS, binary search tree, doubly linked lists.

22
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.140
We're going to learn about algorithms, how to traverse a tree in a graph, how to use recursion properly,

23
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.090
how to improve time, complexity and big o notation.

24
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.300
How do we do sorting, perhaps even searching, all with a goal to help us write better code and answer

25
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.410
interview questions?

26
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.890
One of my favorite sections here is when we're going to take you through a Google interview and demonstrate

27
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.770
each piece of the puzzle so that by the end of it all, you're able to answer really difficult questions

28
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.050
as if you were part of that interview.

29
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.120
By the end of it, you're going to feel confident in any coding interview or whiteboard interview.

30
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.380
At the end.

31
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.390
We're also going to have a ton of questions for you to do on top of the ones that we're going to do

32
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.110
together from all these companies, plus specific questions, whether you want to be a frontend engineer

33
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.610
or a backend engineer.

34
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.490
So you have three options with this course.

35
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.470
If you want, you can just do each course separately and that is fine.

36
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.310
However, the course is structured in a way that these two courses are ordered to make you understand

37
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.080
the topic, build the fundamentals and really connect the dots on interviewing.

38
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.380
So to get the most out of this course, you should follow the lessons in order, since you may gain

39
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.180
an insight or two, even if you thought, Oh, leave me alone, Andre, I already know this stuff.

40
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.820
So now that you have an idea of the outline, let's talk about what it means to succeed in this course.

41
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.680
First, make sure you use our online discord community to communicate with fellow students, ask questions

42
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.100
and talk about anything you may want when it comes to interviews.

43
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.710
There's nothing better than talking out loud and practicing in front of people or with others.

44
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.860
I'm also active every day on this community.

45
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.170
The second part these exercises get harder and harder in each section.

46
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.610
They will challenge you and make you really extend your abilities as a developer.

47
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.110
This is done on purpose.

48
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.970
We're going to be building our foundation throughout the course and do challenging problems so that

49
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.300
when it comes to real interviews, you find things easy.

50
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.210
Although I walk you through the solutions, I encourage you to use available resources to solve the

51
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.780
answer.

52
00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.560
Think of it this way If someone offered you $10,000 bonus to study interview questions for a month,

53
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.670
would you do it?

54
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.660
That is what you're doing.

55
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.290
Practicing for this by working hard and practicing what most people don't do.

56
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.350
Interviewing you're putting yourself in a higher salary position for the rest of your life.

57
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.529
The third point I know it sounds silly, but it's important.

58
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.170
Any time you feel like you're just watching a video and aren't understanding a topic, stop what you're

59
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.520
doing and take a break.

60
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.750
Come back to the problem.

61
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.500
You won't be able to finish this course in one week.

62
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.190
If you do it properly, it will take you about one month to finish everything in here.

63
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.270
So take your time.

64
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.560
This isn't a sprint.

65
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.520
It's a marathon.

66
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.030
Finally try to complete the full course instead of just parts of it.

67
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.350
Most lessons are tied into one from another so that they flow, and we keep building this pyramid of

68
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.950
knowledge.

69
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.120
We'll start from basic and get into more and more advanced topics.

70
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.490
All right.

71
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.330
I think it's time for us to start the course and get prepared to land our dream job.

72
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.360
Let's get started and see you in the next section.

73
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.470
Bye bye.
