00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,200
There are quite a few data structures that you may be asked in an interview and we saw how many of them

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,080
there are on that Wikipedia page.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,410
But luckily for you, the list isn't actually that intimidating.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,100
All you need to learn are these ones over here.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,400
These are used, I would say, 90% of the time.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,760
And this is what we're going to talk about in our course.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,700
Now, there may be specific ones within these groups, and each one of them has trade offs.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,670
But as long as you learn these and you learn when and why you should use them, then you're going to

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,290
be miles ahead of most people.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,170
It's going to be a lot of fun.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,940
Now, before we get going, I want to note one last thing.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,780
You see, each language has their own data types or built in data types.

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:04,069
JavaScript, for example, has numbers, strings has booleans which are true, false, and then some

15
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,500
strange ones like undefined.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,480
And each language has a data structures to organize these data types.

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:21,320
So for example, in JavaScript we have arrays and objects that we use.

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,830
And they are data types.

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:32,260
It allows us to structure and organize information such as our primitive data types or even hold more

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,910
complex ones, like having an array that contains multiple objects.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,760
And we're going to talk about this in more detail, but I want to show you that we do have different

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,570
languages that have different access to some data structures.

23
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,060
You can see over here some of the other languages that we can use in this course and whether they have

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,070
them available.

25
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:06,280
We see that Java has arrays, has linked lists, stacks, we have priority Qs and many other types.

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,410
Now does that mean that if we're using JavaScript, we can only use arrays and objects?

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,650
Well, no, not really.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,730
Although these languages come with data structures built in.

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,020
We can also build our own.

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,850
And most languages have enough data structures and data types for us to build.

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,760
And create our own data structures.

32
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,730
So if JavaScript doesn't have stacks, well, we can build one.

33
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,210
Now to finish this section and finally dive into our first data structure.

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,460
I wanted to just remind you that we have a little map over here of what we need to know for the coding

35
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,090
interview.

36
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:01,950
Now, in this map, I have a little present emoji next to each one of the data structures that we're

37
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,820
going to talk about.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,260
As you can see, there aren't that many of them and many of them are quite related or are children of

39
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,860
the other.

40
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,980
But use this as a reference for you to just draw a map of how things are connected and what the data

41
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,630
structures are that we're going to talk about.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,600
But let's get our hands dirty with our first data structure.

43
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,980
I'll see you in the next one.

44
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,000
Bye bye.
