00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,750
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:10,720
In the previous video, we talked about how new node over here gets repeated both times in append and

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,340
prevent.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:18,880
And as we create more methods on our length list, we're going to have to constantly say new node value

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,510
equals value.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,500
Next No.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,660
And usually we want to keep things dry.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,960
That is, do not repeat yourself in code and many implementations of link list.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,770
You'll see something like this where new node is actually another class.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,880
For example, I can create a new class here, and this is how object oriented programming usually works.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,420
We have classes that interact with other classes to create our programs.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,970
So you'll see a lot of implementations of link lists that have class of node.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:07,350
And this node is going to have a constructor that takes a value and this value will have this dot value

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,370
equals to.

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,270
Value.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,710
It's going to have this next equal to null.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,770
Just like that.

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:30,850
So that way, instead of us saying constant new node and creating this new node every time.

19
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:41,280
I can just say every time that I want to create a new node, we can say let or convert new node.

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,430
Equals to new node and then the value.

21
00:01:49,290 --> 00:02:00,090
So every time we have a new node, we just instantiate what we call create and run this new node.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,330
Class that creates a node for us with a value property and a next property.

23
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:17,600
So you might prefer using this syntax, but because I find this can get a little bit confusing, especially

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,060
if you're not used to classes, I'm going to just keep things the way they are because, well, I think

25
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,110
it's easier to read.

26
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,770
And as you saw, it's fairly easy to implement if you want to do that on your own.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,150
Okay.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,950
Just a quick Segway.

29
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,220
Let's get back to finishing our link list in the next video.

30
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,090
Bye bye.
