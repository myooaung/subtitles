00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.290
This is another question that gets asked a lot Why us?

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.770
Why do you want to work for us?

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.440
Why did you choose our company?

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.020
A question that gets asked every time and any question that gets asked every time.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.280
You should be very prepared for it.

6
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.560
This is where you shine and you really have an answer that blows them out of the water.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.060
The key here is to make the interviewer feel special.

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.520
Make them feel that this is your top choice and that this is where you see a long career for yourself.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.400
They don't want to hire somebody that's going to be there just for a year.

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.030
They want somebody who really wants this job and is willing to dedicate years of their life growing

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.020
with the company.

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.530
So make them feel special.

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.550
Make the interviewer feel that you really, really like this company, you admire this company, and

14
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.690
also that you respect the fact that they work there.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.470
This is the classic question where you can give a very generic answer that everybody says and you won't

16
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.030
stand out.

17
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.440
And remember, interviewing is all about standing up, not doing what everybody else does.

18
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.260
So a typical answer to a question like this.

19
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.110
Well, a really bad answer to a question like this will be something along the lines of, well, I just

20
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.110
saw you guys on LinkedIn and I needed a job to make money.

21
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.750
That is a terrible answer.

22
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.130
So never say that.

23
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.970
A better answer is something along the lines of.

24
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.060
Well, you know, I've been researching your company for a while, and I noticed that you're doing some

25
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.550
work on X, and I myself have done some work in the past similar to this, and this is what I learned

26
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.420
about it.

27
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.740
And then you can go on with that, and then you can say something along the lines of.

28
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.450
And I think the problem of X is really interesting, and I think it's something that I can add value

29
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.380
to but also learn and become better at.

30
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.290
And again, this is just an example, but the idea here is that you're going to blow them out of the

31
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.650
water.

32
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.850
They expect you to give a generic answer, but instead you talk about a specific problem.

33
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.190
You talk about the fact that you did your research.

34
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.260
Perhaps you talk to other developers on that company through LinkedIn, or you read one of their recent

35
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.400
blog posts and you understand what kind of problems they're trying to solve.

36
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.290
You answer this question by demonstrating that you have those skills.

37
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.280
You mentioned some of the key words that they have in the job description.

38
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.450
But also demonstrate that you're not like the rest that just wants a job.

39
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.220
And they're applying to a ton of companies.

40
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.880
Tell them that you specifically searched companies and found this company interesting because of the

41
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.230
type of work they do.

42
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.650
It shows that you want to grow, and it also demonstrates that you'd be great for this job because you've

43
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.990
worked with some of their problems in the past.

44
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.540
And this might remind you of, yes, the four heroes.

45
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.900
You talk about the technical aspects and how you worked on similar things that they're looking for.

46
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.110
It shows that you're the type of person who's successful because, well, you're actually going out

47
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.870
and researching and and not just applying to companies blindly and waiting for any company to accept

48
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.230
you.

49
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.050
It also demonstrates leadership because you went out on your own and read their blog post, talk to

50
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.720
their developers to make sure that you understand what the company's needs are, and then also talks

51
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.490
about challenge, how you worked on similar problems and you overcame them or you think you can help

52
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.880
out.

53
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.910
And by this point you just start to see a pattern.

54
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.500
We're always trying to use the four heroes.

55
00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.570
We're always trying to stand out, and we're always trying to be the best version of ourself to the

56
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.230
interviewer.

57
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.870
Now, before I end this video, I want to add a quick note here, and that is part of the question might

58
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.760
come with the follow up question by the interviewer, which is Why did you leave your job?

59
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.960
Why do you want to work for us?

60
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.680
Why is your last job not good enough for you that you want to move?

61
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.450
Everybody has different answers for you, but the one thing that you want to be careful of is no negativity.

62
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.200
They don't want to hear you complain about your coworkers, your boss, the ugly code base that your

63
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.220
last company had.

64
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.550
Be as positive as possible.

65
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.170
Just say that you want to grow.

66
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.560
You want more challenge.

67
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.990
You want to work with people that are really smart like they have with this company.

68
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.200
No negativity.

69
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.330
Be as positive as possible and show how you just want to grow.

70
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.280
You just want to learn from the best, work with the best.

71
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.190
And you are the type of person that can be put in any situation to succeed.

72
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.730
And at this moment, this company is your answer.

73
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.940
I'll see in the next one.
