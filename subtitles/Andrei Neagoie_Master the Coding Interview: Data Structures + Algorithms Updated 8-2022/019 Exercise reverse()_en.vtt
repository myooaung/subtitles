Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.650
I have a fun little exercise for you, and I know I call every single exercise fun, but I think this

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.750
one is especially fun.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:20.210
Now, one of the most popular interview questions when it comes to linked lists is to reverse a linked

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.900
list.

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.240
What do I mean by that?

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.680
Well, an interviewer is going to say we have a linked list here.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.950
How would you go about reversing this list?

9
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.470
If I have a list over here, that is 110, 16, 18.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.230
How can you make the list?

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.440
The link list?

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.160
Go from 88 to 16 to 10 to 1.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.250
How would you reverse it and flip it?

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.340
And we're going to use a singly linked list for this exercise.

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.730
And all we want to do is create a new method.

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.660
That is going to say reverse.

17
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.960
And this method in here will have to do some magic that will reverse this force.

18
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.880
Remember, we're not just printing out an array.

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.210
We want a reversed link list that now has 88 referencing, 16 that has referencing or pointing to ten

20
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.210
and ten pointing to one and one pointing to no.

21
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.450
How would you go about doing this?

22
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.170
Good luck with this exercise and I'll see you in The Solution video.

23
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.400
Bye bye.
