00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.009
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's talk about another fond topic and that is getting a raise.

3
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.520
How do we go about doing this?

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.650
Getting a raise is hopefully not that hard because remember, if somebody hired you, that means they

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.730
find you valuable.

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.870
But in order to get a raise, you have to be a good employee.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.680
If you're a terrible employee, you don't do your work on time.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.680
You don't provide good quality work.

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.120
Then getting a raise is not realistic.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.840
So the first step is to actually be a good employee.

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.390
And hopefully because you're taking this course, you are the type of person who really values their

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.450
skills and has a strong, self determined work ethic.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.820
I mean, you're teaching yourself how to ace the interviews.

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.770
You're definitely the type of person who's determined to succeed.

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.530
So that's a good sign.

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340
And when you start a job you want to hit the ground running.

17
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.610
The better you are as the employee, the more likely you are for them to keep you around.

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.120
And one thing that I really like to do before you start a job is to plan out your career path ahead

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.450
of time at this company before your first day on the job.

20
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.560
And this should be in the back of your mind throughout your career.

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.890
This way you have an idea of where you want to be in 1 to 3, maybe five years at the company.

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
And you can check up on that to make sure that you don't become complacent.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
You don't just stay in the same role and not grow and just become comfortable.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.650
But anyway, let's talk about getting a raise.

25
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.730
How do we do it?

26
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.950
Well, luckily for you, there's just two steps that we're going to go over.

27
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.870
First things first is that getting a raise is one of the easiest ways to earn money.

28
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.370
You know how we all try to save money by not buying a coffee, buying gasoline for our car when the

29
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.360
gas is cheaper?

30
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.670
Those are really good ways to save money.

31
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.100
But getting a raise and getting paid more is just an easier way for you to have more money.

32
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.560
So it's a very, very important thing.

33
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.330
The first step that we want to do is to actually ask for a raise.

34
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.750
I know it's a silly point to have, but you have no idea how many times people say, Oh, my company

35
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.970
doesn't really do raises, or people are thinking that by asking for a raise, they are considered rude

36
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.470
and they're going to get fired.

37
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.320
Especially as an engineer.

38
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.080
At the end of the day, you'll get a raise if you provide value to the company.

39
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.560
If you never ask, the answer is always no.

40
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.630
For example, $10,000 means a lot more to you than it does to a company because, well, they have a

41
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.630
lot more money than you.

42
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.210
So think about it this way.

43
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.430
If you owned a business and you had an employee, that is fantastic.

44
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.000
Great.

45
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.370
Would you pay them 10,000 more on top of their salary, just out of the kindness of your heart?

46
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.010
I mean, you might, but most likely you're not going to unless they ask.

47
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.750
But if they ask, you value them, right?

48
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.870
Finding a new employee to do the work, to train them and hopefully be as good as you are, is going

49
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.210
to cost your business a lot of money.

50
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.690
You're not going to say no to a, let's say, 10% increase in their salary because it means a lot less

51
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.990
to you.

52
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.950
So keep that in mind.

53
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.110
For companies, hiring and training people is really expensive.

54
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.430
They rather keep the good employees that they have.

55
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.740
It's a lot cheaper to do so.

56
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.910
So always ask for a raise.

57
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.300
All companies, if you provide enough value, should have the capacity to give you raises.

58
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.270
But here's the thing, and this is the second part.

59
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.030
You have to show don't tell.

60
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.730
You can't just say I'm valuable.

61
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.230
Can I have more money?

62
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.950
You actually want to show them why you're valuable?

63
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.940
Let me explain.

64
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.010
When asking for a raise, you don't just go in and ask for it.

65
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.600
You want to make a presentation, maybe a one page summary document, perhaps, or an email to your

66
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.930
boss offering proof that you're driving the metrics, the numbers that matter to them.

67
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.019
This way you show your great investment and you show the numbers, the stories, the reason why you

68
00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.670
should get a raise.

69
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.210
If you don't have a reason and you just want to raise and you just say that it doesn't make sense.

70
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.080
So hopefully you're a good employee, a good engineer, and you're contributing to the company.

71
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.430
And at the end of the day, there's no easy way around it.

72
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.700
What you're going to do is during your first months at the job.

73
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.170
I would personally keep a folder with all the good things you have done for the company, and this is

74
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.790
something that I've done myself as well.

75
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.750
Problems you have solved, money you've saved.

76
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.470
Great comments or feedbacks you have gotten from clients and co-workers emails and perhaps keep track

77
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.940
of your skill level from the first day on the job to the six months mark.

78
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.840
What did you learn?

79
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.980
What did you improve on?

80
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.700
List all these skills you have acquired and list what you plan to accomplish in the next six months.

81
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.440
Write this all out in a document by writing a one page letter showing example of this proof of how good

82
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.360
of an employee you are, what you've learned, what your plans are for the next six months to improve

83
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.050
the company.

84
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.230
Now you have a way to meet with the person in charge of making the salary decision and actually give

85
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.500
them this piece of document that shows why you deserve a higher salary, why you're a different person

86
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.300
than you were when they first hired you, when they didn't know that you were going to be valuable.

87
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.600
And finally, you want to ask for a salary level a lot higher than you actually want.

88
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.170
So a good general rule is 10,000 more than you actually want.

89
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.490
Because most likely they're going to meet you in the middle.

90
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.660
And this will make the middle the happy ground for both parties.

91
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.100
OC and I know what you're thinking.

92
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.330
It's not going to work on.

93
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.580
J may have worked for you, but not not for me.

94
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.690
And this sounds very blunt.

95
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.930
Some people are worried about asking raises and it's an uncomfortable situation.

96
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.340
But let me ask you this.

97
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:25.800
If both employer and employee respect each other, value each other, shouldn't this be normal to find

98
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.230
a middle ground where both parties are happy?

99
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.170
After all, look at all the good that you have done for them.

100
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.360
Like I said before, it's very expensive for companies to hire new developers, new engineers.

101
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.820
You're already established yourself.

102
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.910
You've proven yourself, and you've done a great job with the company.

103
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.710
They want to keep you around.

104
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.440
Value yourself because they value you.

105
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.910
To finish off.

106
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.460
I just want to give an example of a little story of how I managed to get raises of my previous job.

107
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.130
I got a raise every six months.

108
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.140
And it wasn't because they just gave it to me.

109
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.190
It's because I asked for a raise.

110
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.580
Every six months and every six months I received a raise.

111
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.140
As a matter of fact, one time I got to raise that.

112
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.820
Well, I wasn't happy with.

113
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.610
And I said, why?

114
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.030
I thought it should be more.

115
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.010
And they actually agreed and came back and gave me an even higher raise.

116
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:26.610
And that story is not just for me to boast and show off, but to show you that it's possible.

117
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.830
You have to ask.

118
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.410
If you never ask, the answer's always no.

119
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.140
Show why you deserve the race and you'll be surprised at how easy it is to do so.

120
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.200
I hope this was helpful.

121
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.640
And I'll see you in the next video.

122
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.720
Bye bye.
