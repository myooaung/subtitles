1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,170
The most successful people that I know.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,300
And I'm not just talking about developers.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,310
I'm talking about all the successful people that I know are masters of learning.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,000
We all have the same amount of time in the day.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,950
23 hours, 56 minutes and 26 seconds.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,680
However, some people are able to accomplish more than others.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,780
Why is that?

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,340
I'm a big proponent of efficiency.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,380
If you're able to learn something in much less time than somebody else, then you can compound the benefit

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,580
over your lifetime.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,090
Now, I know many people have different learning abilities, but this isn't a contest with others.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,280
This is a contest within yourself.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,110
Figure out what makes you successful in learning.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,050
Don't compare yourself to others, whether you're a visual learner, or maybe you need to take breaks

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,210
every 30 minutes.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,970
Figure out what your best learning style is.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,070
Learn how to learn.

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,920
Don't just watch videos blindly at two times the speed and expect to learn everything.

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,980
Find the most efficient way that works for you and keep practicing.

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,600
By learning to learn, you become a better developer.

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,860
As developers, we have to constantly learn throughout our career.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,970
Our learning never stops because technology is constantly evolving.

23
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,840
So if you want to be a successful developer.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,760
You have to learn your best learning style.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,150
It is better to figure out what makes you tick, what makes things clearer for you now then later on

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,050
in your career.

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,340
Start early.

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,460
Figure out what is the best method for you because it's going to be a skill that you're going to use

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,630
throughout your career.
