00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,390
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's do a little exercise with just the general information we have about these two traversal techniques.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,420
I have questions here for you.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:17,890
And underneath it, I want you to answer whether you should use breath for a search or depth for search.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,930
And these are the type of questions that you're going to get asked in an interview.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,230
And it's good to understand I know that our knowledge is incomplete yet because we haven't coded anything.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,570
But I want to lay the foundation so that when we start coding, you understand why we have these things.

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,240
So give it a go.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,060
Try and answer these questions.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,670
And in the next video, I'll go over the solutions.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,570
Bye bye.
