1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,230
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,470
Let's talk about another question that get asked a lot in interviews.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,400
Tell me about a problem that you had and how you overcame it or how you solved it.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,790
Again, a very common question.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,880
How do you answer this?

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,870
Well.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,910
We should know this by now.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,190
This should be prepared.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,050
We should be ready when they ask this question or any variation of this type of question.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,910
Ideally you have a big project from a past company that you work with or a personal project that you

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,960
can answer this with.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:42,470
Again, going back to our portfolio and how we want to have 1 to 2 big projects so we can answer questions

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,020
like these and also impress the interviewer.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:51,890
Now with these type of questions, we want to use something called the SA method as a R method that

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,130
is situation, action and result.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
When asked this question, we start off with the situation.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,190
We tell the interviewer, This is how the project was.

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,459
This is the problem that we had.

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,290
This is the situation.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,600
The second part is the action.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,480
What did you do to solve that situation?

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,020
I did this.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,560
I wrote a piece of software.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,640
What did you do?

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,990
How did you try and solve?

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,310
And then the result is what happened.

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,970
After you took that action, the number of users increased the performance of the website improved.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,030
So SA situation action result.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,330
This shows exactly what the problem is, what you did with the problem and how you solved it.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,680
And you see over here the second point, we want to have metrics and numbers.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,630
If you're able to give numbers to the interviewer, it sounds impressive.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,120
If I say I improve the performance of a website or I increase the number of users, that doesn't sound

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,040
impressive versus saying something like the website performance improved by 50%, or we increased our

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,070
monthly active users by 30%.

35
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,400
Again, something that you can prepare ahead of time in your stories.

36
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:18,380
This is why when I talked about the portfolios, we want to focus on big projects versus many small

37
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,800
projects, because when you get asked this question and your problem is that you had a difficult time

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
building a to do list app or a small little app.

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,770
It's not going to sound impressive.

40
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,370
That's what everybody else does.

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,840
Instead, talk about a real problem.

42
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:41,240
And that's something that we've built in past courses where we talked about difficult problems such

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,410
as caching, scaling, performance, security, and these three over here, scaling performance.

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,740
Security are really, really good things to talk about.

45
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:59,180
If you're able to use one of these of how you improve security, how you improved performance, how

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,360
you improved scaling, it's going to be really impressive because all companies have these problems

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,270
and they want people that can solve these type of problems.

48
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,670
You have to be careful here.

49
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,560
You can just make up stuff or say things that you cannot back up.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,690
Expect that once you answer this question, the interviewer is going to ask you more details about it.

51
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,190
So if you improved caching and the app to improve performance, you better be sure that you're going

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,200
to get asked how you did it and more detail.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,060
So be able to answer those.

54
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,630
But again, with enough preparation, this should be fairly easy to you.

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,180
As a side note, if this problem happened to be with maybe a teammate or your work team wasn't performing

56
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,070
well, don't be negative again.

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:51,130
Never place blame on clients or coworkers or bosses.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,800
Just simply state the problem and say how you helped solve it.

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,740
People don't really want to work with complainers.

60
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,600
They want to work with people that just get to work, solve problems, and move on.

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,270
Keep in mind, don't be robotic when answering questions.

62
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,250
Be human.

63
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:14,000
And a good way to think about this is if you saw yourself on TV answering this question, will you like

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,570
yourself?

65
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,190
And that's really it.

66
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,769
So go out there, have this question prepared because you're for sure going to get asked this question.

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,360
I'll see you in the next video.

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:24,940
Okay.

69
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,400
I lied.

70
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:31,000
There's one last thing, and that is you're going to get a variation of this question, such as tell

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,530
me about an interesting project you've worked on, and they're very similar.

72
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,070
The goal here is to talk about an impressive project to while the interviewer and tell them how a you're

73
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,760
different because you're building these interesting things, but also how you've worked with what the

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,790
company is looking for in the past.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,710
So you've worked with JavaScript, you've worked with C Sharp, you've worked with C++.

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,470
Whenever you're talking about a project about a problem you solved, you always want to bring it back

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,000
to what the company right now is looking for, because at the end of the day, that's what they care

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,190
about.

79
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,930
They care about.

80
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,250
Can you solve the problems?

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,650
So again, make sure you stand out and make sure you're related to the job.

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,480
I'll see you in the next one.

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,350
Bye bye.
