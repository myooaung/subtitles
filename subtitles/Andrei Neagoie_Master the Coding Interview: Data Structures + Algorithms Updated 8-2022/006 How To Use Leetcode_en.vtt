Hello there.

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:08.210
I want to talk quickly about one of the tools that we're going to use throughout the course, especially

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.980
when we do bonus questions and also for you to use after you're done with the course.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.140
In my opinion, this is the best website to get interview questions.

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:25.250
And the thing that I love about Elite Code is that they have a ton of questions, but they give really,

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.360
really good descriptions.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.470
And you're also able to code online in a ton of different languages that you choose.

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.770
It's up to you what you choose to code in.

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.640
And although they have a paid version, you can do most of these problems without a subscription just

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.240
for free.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.760
I also want to give you a heads up and let you know that their interface sometimes changes.

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.580
As you can see, for some problems, it looks like this.

13
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.380
And when you watch this video, things must be organized a little bit different on the screen.

14
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.440
But the key thing is there's the solution tab, which some questions will have.

15
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.270
But my favorite is the Discuss tab because no matter what your language, you can type in a solution

16
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.780
here and you'll see all the people that did their solution.

17
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.130
And let's say Python or let's say you want to do C++.

18
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.820
Well, all the C++ solutions are here as well as the votes, views and comments.

19
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.610
This is, again, one of my favorite resources.

20
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.150
But I want to warn you, there are a ton of problems here and they vary from easy to really difficult.

21
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.970
And you can spend a lot of time just constantly doing these questions over and over, but don't get

22
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.830
sucked into the rabbit hole.

23
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.310
After you do a certain number of problems here, you're already going to be a lot better than the average

24
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.180
programmer.

25
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.580
So do them for fun afterwards.

26
00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.910
But don't forget to focus on what the most important task at hand is that is getting that dream job.

27
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.690
And don't worry, some of the top programmers still have difficulties with some of the questions here.

28
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.760
So never feel like this shows you the quality of the programmer you are.

29
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.950
It's just a playground for you to use throughout your career to improve.

30
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.760
And no, they are not sponsoring me or doing anything like that.

31
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.890
I just think they are a great tool.

32
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.920
I'll see you in the next one.
