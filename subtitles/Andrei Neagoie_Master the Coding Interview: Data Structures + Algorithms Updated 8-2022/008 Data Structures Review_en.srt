1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,330
There we have it.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,960
Our end to the data structures section.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,410
Was it as scary as you initially thought?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,960
Hopefully by the end of this section, if you've watched all the videos and done all the exercises,

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,790
you feel a lot more comfortable.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,150
You can use the tools that you've learned to be a better engineer and make better decisions.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,000
Hopefully you don't look as scared as this emoji did at the beginning of this section.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,250
And we've learned that these data structures at the end of the day are our friends.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,400
And by the way, I'm really proud of this slide.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,290
I spent way too long creating this little thing that I have.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,060
I have Mr. Hash Table here.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,470
That's Mrs. Zare.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,300
That's a little link list.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,460
That's.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,790
Mr..

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,850
Q Mrs. Stack's scary looking graph, and of course, Professor Tree.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:04,430
Anyway, I hope you're no longer intimidated by these subjects, because all around us, when we look

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,450
at technology, they're all built by data structures.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,990
We hold information and data structures no matter how many data structures they are and there will be

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,860
in the future.

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,650
Most of the building blocks are right here.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,620
You see something like blockchain that has become really popular in recent years are just data structures

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,730
that we've learned about.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,300
It has some aspects of linked lists.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,350
It has some hashing that it does, which we know about.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,790
And it also uses some trie data structure and trees having the fundamentals that you have now.

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,330
One day, maybe you'll build your own data structure.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,220
I'll see you in the next one.

29
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,450
Bye bye.
