1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:09,330
Even the greatest of engineers sometimes get rejected, just like in dating.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,079
Sometimes two of the greatest people in the world may not be the right fit for each other.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,200
Rejections don't really mean anything, especially when it comes to interviewing.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,370
Because nobody really cares about the rejection, doesn't go on your resume.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,740
It doesn't go in your LinkedIn profile.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,160
It just disappears once you get rejected.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:42,070
You see winners and people that are good at interviewing just get up after a rejection and go on and

8
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,970
keep swinging.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,900
I'm using a baseball reference here.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,540
I hope people understand.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,370
So here's the fun fact.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,490
I myself got rejected from numerous jobs.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,360
Does that make me a bad coder?

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,480
Does that make me a bad employee?

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,460
I mean, maybe.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,000
But it also means that it wasn't the right fit for one another.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,320
It's probably good that they rejected me because I probably wouldn't have enjoyed working for them or

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,030
I wouldn't have gotten the jobs that I had if I wasn't rejected by the previous ones.

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,400
You see, rejections are never a predictor of success.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,370
99 rejections and one offer is better than two rejections and no offer.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,410
So it's all a statistic game.

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,380
All you need to do is go out and bat.

23
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,400
Go swing.

24
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,750
Get interviews.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,830
And no matter how many times you're rejected, all you need is that one.

26
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,590
And if you get more than one, that's just the bonus.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,670
So when you get rejected, see if we can extract as much information or feedback as possible from the

28
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,240
company.

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,630
Tell them that you're constantly looking to improve and that you love some feedback.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,170
I mean, they already rejected you.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,390
What's the harm in asking?

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,199
Might as well get some information out of it and then finally ask them when it would be okay to reapply

33
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,540
if you're still interested down the road.

34
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,690
You see, I know a few people who have been rejected by numerous companies and they just kept applying

35
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,810
and eventually got hired.

36
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,160
Actually no person working at Google who did exactly that.

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,110
So don't burn any bridges.

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,850
Just ask them when you can apply again.

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,540
Just remember, think about how much of our life we actually spend searching for jobs versus actually

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,140
working.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,350
We actually don't spend a lot of time in our overall life applying to jobs interview.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,990
So if you look at the grand scheme of things, don't be disappointed if you don't get hired within a

43
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,470
week.

44
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,210
You should spend time looking for jobs and opportunities because most likely you're going to be there

45
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,140
for a long time.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,700
So you want to make it count.

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:06,350
You also can't say that you're on hirable and get depressed or sad because you had a few rejections.

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Sometimes Luck just plays a role in interview.

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,180
So just don't take it personally.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,650
It's okay to fail.

51
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,750
I failed multiple times.

52
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,190
Everybody fails.

53
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,210
Sometimes you just have a bad day.

54
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,360
It's not the end of the world if you fail, right?

55
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,420
For companies, for example, they're more likely to say no than say yes because it is a big risk for

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,680
them to hire somebody.

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,040
You're going to start getting doubts in your mind about your abilities and your skills with all these

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,970
rejections.

59
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,080
However.

60
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,920
Like I said before, if you fail ten times, try ten times more.

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,360
All you need is that one success.

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,930
I promise you that if each day you're learning, you're getting better and better, your skills are

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,710
improving.

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,740
Then one day you will get that offer.

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,340
Most people just don't go out and keep adding.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,550
I'll see you in the next video.
