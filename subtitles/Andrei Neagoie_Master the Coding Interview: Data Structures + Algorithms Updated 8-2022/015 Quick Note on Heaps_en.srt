00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,800
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,700
I wanted to add a quick gotcha when it comes to heaps.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,330
That is when you hear memory heaps.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,230
That's not the same as the heap data structure.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,530
You might have heard of memory heaps in something like a JavaScript runtime engine where we have a stack

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,760
and a heap, the two locations where we are able to keep memory.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,720
Now this heap you can think of as free storage is a region in our memory where we can store arbitrary

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,290
data.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,980
Languages like C also have this heap.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:43,410
Now the naming is just coincidental and heap has no real relationship with the data structure that is

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,460
named Heap.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,880
Keep that in mind.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,480
Heap is simply a heap of memory.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,650
If you're talking about a language runtime, for example, versus a heap data structure, which is what

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,730
we're talking about now.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,130
I want us to clarify that for you, because when I was learning about heaps for some reason, I always

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,270
thought they were the same thing.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,590
But they're not just throwing it out there.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,960
I'll see you in the next video.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,740
Bye bye.
