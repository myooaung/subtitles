1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,200
We've talked about recursion and sorting.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,390
We have a few more to go.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:15,010
And in this section we're going to talk about searching and traversal, including breadth first search

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,780
and depth for search.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,110
Searching is something we do a lot on our computers.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,520
When we talked about sorting, some of you may have been like, it doesn't really sound that useful,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,170
but searching.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,570
We use that every day, don't we?

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,210
We look for files on our computer.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,960
We run command F and search for things, search for words and documents.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,290
We search Google, we search YouTube.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,800
We search hashtags on Twitter and Instagram.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,420
Searching is a big part of our lives, but how are all these computers and programs able to search things

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,620
so fast?

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,700
There's more and more data in this world.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,340
More and more websites to search for.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,970
How were we able to do these things so fast?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,180
How is Google able to do these things so fast?

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,130
Well, in this section, we're going to build this foundation of how it all works.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,230
And we're going to be talking about a few types of searching and traversal.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,680
And hopefully by the end of it all, you're going to understand how places like Facebook, Google and

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,600
Google Maps work when it comes to searching at a fundamental level.

23
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,020
Let's get started.
