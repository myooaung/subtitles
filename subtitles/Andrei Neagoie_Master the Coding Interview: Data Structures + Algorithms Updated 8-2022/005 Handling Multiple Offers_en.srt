1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,690
Handling multiple offers.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,370
This is a great problem to have.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,200
If you're able to get multiple offers, well then you're definitely doing something right.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,060
This should be your goal.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,980
Your goal going to interviews is not to say, I really hope they hire me.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,340
I hope I just get one offer.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,160
Ideally, you get multiple offers.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,110
The more choices we have, the better we can make a decision on where we should go, where we should

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,590
work.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,870
But first of all, congratulations.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,430
If you got to this point, someone finds your skills valuable.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,340
But what do you do if you have multiple offers?

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,770
We know what to do when there's one offer.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,100
But what if you have two or more companies interested in Yoona?

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:51,820
You first have to decide which company you want and you're hopefully handling each of these companies,

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,520
letting them know that the other has made an offer and you have figured out what sort of salary and

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,020
benefits that you're going to get.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
But salary and benefits aren't the only thing that should matter to you.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,340
And over here, I've created a list for you.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,010
A priority list of what should go into deciding which company to work for.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,290
Number one being the most important.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,210
And number five being the least important, at least in this list, this rank of importance.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,820
And keep in mind that this is based on individual situations.

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,680
Should be a guideline for you to decide what company you should go with.

25
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,500
The first one is that is there an offer that you feel you're under qualified for?

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:46,440
Is one of the companies offering your job that you think is way over your head, way harder than the

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,970
skills that you think you have.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,970
Because if that's the case, you should go with that company.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,080
You're not taking a job to do the same thing that you already know what to do.

30
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,960
You're taking a job to grow and learn so that next time you interview, next time you're looking for

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,670
a job, you're even better skilled, better prepared, more valuable.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:13,660
So if one of the jobs is way harder than the other, then that's a good sign that you should take it,

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,160
because that's the one that's going to allow you to really push your skills to the next level.

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,470
And this relates to the second point, long term growth potential.

35
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,820
Between the two offers, which one allows you to grow?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,820
This means not just your skills being able to become a better engineer, a better programmer, developer,

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
whatever it is you're looking for, but also.

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,830
Is the company growing?

39
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:45,330
Do you have an ability to perhaps grow into that position and get promoted and in better position,

40
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,790
better roles, long term growth potential?

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,280
Don't just look at the short term here.

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,300
So in five years, if you stay at this company in five years, will you still be doing the same thing?

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
Hopefully not.

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,880
Third is, will you respect the people you're working with?

45
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,520
Are you going to be the smartest person in the room or the dumbest person in the room?

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,260
Which one do you think is better?

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,560
If you're the smartest person at a company, well, you're not growing as much, are you?

48
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,230
You're not learning from others.

49
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,530
You may be in charge, and that may be good.

50
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,880
But if you're an engineer, developer, programmer, you're looking to improve your skills.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,760
If your coworkers, people around you are way smarter than you, that allows you to really grow and

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,150
learn.

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,070
And that's a really important factor.

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
The next one.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes, everybody's favorite salary and benefits.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,160
It's pretty surprising that it's number four.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,550
Right.

58
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,300
But we're thinking long term here.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,540
Salary and benefits aren't as important as the ones on the top and the one, two and three spot.

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,810
And most people put this first.

61
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:58,640
But there's a classic psychological study where they present a cake to some young kids.

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,560
And they say that you can have this cake now, or if you wait 10 minutes, you can get two pieces of

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,640
cake instead of one.

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,510
And they studied immediate gratification versus long term gratification.

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:18,380
And I don't know how accurate the study is, but the point of the study was that the kids who waited

66
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,340
for two pieces of cake instead of just eating the cake right away and not waiting, the kids who waited

67
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,220
were more successful long term throughout their careers.

68
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,480
The idea of delayed gratification not looking at the immediate benefits, but looking at long term benefits.

69
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,660
Keep in mind, a salary doesn't include just money.

70
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,030
There's also moving expenses, bonuses, stock options.

71
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,780
Health care and a whole lot of other packages.

72
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,120
So your final decision when it comes to salary and benefits is to combine all of those.

73
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,710
Finally, the fifth point is, is your decision based on desperation?

74
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,500
You've got to remind yourself, are you doing this because you think you won't get any other offers

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,310
like this?

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,310
Because that's not good.

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,230
You're most likely won't stay at this company for that long of a time, or at least not for your entire

78
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,710
life.

79
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,300
Most likely you'll move on to another company in a few years and go through the interview process all

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,960
over again.

81
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,050
So make the decision with that in mind.

82
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,550
Is this company worth it?

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,940
Am I just accepting a job because I'm desperate and I think this is the only option am I going to get?

84
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,220
Because if you're going to be in the same position two years from now, then that won't really help

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,910
you, will it?

86
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:46,830
The final decision when it comes to companies is to think about how this will look in the narrative

87
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,730
of your life.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,620
Will this look good on my resume?

89
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,410
If it does, then you should take that job.

90
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,270
Don't take the job.

91
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,770
That's the most comfortable.

92
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,730
The easiest or you're confident that that's the easiest.

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,570
Take the job that will push you and really stretch and grow you in your career.

94
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,460
And at the end of the day, pick the option that will make you happy.

95
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,620
If you don't enjoy something, you probably won't be giving it your all anyway.

96
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,970
If your job gives you purpose and makes you happy, that's probably a good sign to you.

97
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,000
And then finally, when you're rejecting an offer from another company, just never burn down bridges.

98
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,340
Be nice to people and you never know when this will come back to help you in the future.

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,940
I wanted to give you an example of one of my situations when I have multiple offers from each company.

100
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,630
I told both companies that I have gotten an offer.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,870
I actually managed to get one of the companies to give me an offer after the first company sent the

102
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,490
offer and gave me a deadline.

103
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,260
So I did exactly like I said in the previous videos message the other company letting them know that

104
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,670
there was an offer on the table.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,020
I then had both offers from these companies and they actually kept increasing the salary because they

106
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,300
knew that I was wanted by others.

107
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,780
I actually ended up picking the job with a lower salary than the other one because of all these factors

108
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,400
that you see here today.

109
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,610
And I am here where I am because of that decision.

110
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,340
That wasn't the only decision.

111
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,090
There's going to be many decisions throughout your life, but really think about the long term implications

112
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,050
and make sure that you're happy with the decision that you make.

113
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,310
I'll see you in the next one.
