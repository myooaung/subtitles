00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,690
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,400
Now, in the previous exercise and the exercise we just did, we see that we had to do a bit of calculation

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,290
and it was kind of annoying where we had to add things up, then have this plus five and plus four in

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,980
interviews.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,930
You're never going to do this.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,810
And you're asking yourself, Andre, why did you just teach me this?

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,000
And you're right, but now you at least understand how big O gets calculated.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,840
But most of the time when you go into interviews, there's these set of rules that you're going to follow

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,270
where you don't need to do this, and you can just take a look at this function and immediately say

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,590
what type of big o it is.

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,740
For example, this function actually just turns into O of n.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,290
This function.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,500
Again turns into just o of n.

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,340
And this is a nifty little trick.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,650
When we talk about Big O in interviews, most of the time you're only going to give one of these answers.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,430
You're most likely never going to actually calculate precisely o of three n or of three n plus two plus

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,180
one.

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,580
So how was I able to simplify our exercises and just say that they're own?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,560
And luckily for you, there's just several rules that we can follow when it comes to they go and there's

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,610
only four of them.

21
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,600
By following these four rules, instead of doing those small little calculations that we've been doing

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,560
up until this moment, you can just simplify your life so that big becomes really, really easy to calculate.

23
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,750
Let's tackle the first one.

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,730
That is rule number one.

25
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,110
Worst case.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,060
Let's talk about that in the next video.
