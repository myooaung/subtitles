1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:07,670
In this video, we're going to talk about how to contribute to open source and actually take you through

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,420
the steps.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,570
But first, for those who don't know what is open source.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,590
Well, a lot of technology that has been created on the Internet that we know today has been built on

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,840
top of open source projects.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,700
And open source projects means that anybody can view the code.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:36,720
Anybody can see the code of a program, can inspect it, can modify it, can enhance it in this way.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,220
The idea is that by sharing this information with everybody, we get everybody's input and we use the

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,100
collective mind to improve software.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,150
Not only that, but it also benefits everybody.

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,690
Right?

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:59,030
For example, the most famous example of an open source project is Linux, an operating system just

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,960
like Windows or Mac OS, except it's built by everyday programmers.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,870
And it's code that is completely open sourced.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,420
Anybody can inspect the code, add on to it.

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:24,610
And it's become so successful that most of the cloud that we know of the servers usually run Linux at

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,410
us Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, all of them use Linux.

18
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,080
Some of you might be running Linux right now as you watch this video.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,340
So not only do you get to work with other developers from around the world where you can build great

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,470
projects, but just working in teams by learning how open source works.

21
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,890
Well, you don't have to create something as big as Linux.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,210
You can create a project with a friend, something very small and simple.

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,690
It doesn't really matter.

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:06,480
The idea is of collaboration, of openness and sharing code to hopefully improve on the collective knowledge.

25
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,250
Finally, a lot of employers actually look upon open source contribution as a plus.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,430
So if you're able to put in your resume that you're an open source contributor, well, that's a good

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,940
sign.

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,620
Plus, it teaches you valuable skills using Git and GitHub to work in teams if you're looking for job

29
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,510
experience, but you don't have a job.

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,960
Contributing to open source is the perfect way for you to learn how to work in teams and mimic a work

31
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,130
like scenario.

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,420
This is a really important video and something I'm really excited about.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,080
So let's show you how to make your first open source contribution, improve your resume, learn some

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,350
real life skills, and have fun along the way.

35
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,780
Now we've actually created some open source projects for you for this course.

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:06,110
We have the zero two mastery repository here where we can see that we have about 64 projects open right

37
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,390
now with about 2000 contributors.

38
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,410
That's a lot of people, and this number's bound to increase.

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,500
Now, this place was created as a practice ground for you, a playground.

40
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,400
Nobody will yell at you if you break things.

41
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,950
You can contribute at silly things, whatever you want.

42
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,930
It's a testing ground.

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,600
The idea is to have as much fun as possible and make it as easy as possible to contribute to open source.

44
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,150
Now within that organization, we have a great community of administrator or management team that will

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,550
help you with these open source projects.

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,770
By the way, who are these administrators?

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,330
They're right here.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,290
Ignore my name.

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,310
I help out as well.

50
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,950
But they do a lot of the heavy lifting.

51
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,930
And they are past students, just like you, that have had a bit of experience now.

52
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,870
Most of them are working full time, but they are now helping out the community by helping with our

53
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,030
open source projects, our discord and generally just helping our community grow.

54
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,770
So shout out to them.

55
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,810
If you get a chance, say hi to them on Discord.

56
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,550
They definitely do a lot for this community.

57
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,490
They're very active on Discord, and they really help maintain all of our open source projects.

58
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,580
So let's learn how to make our very first open source contribution.

59
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,440
I do want to note here that this isn't the only way for you to contribute to open source.

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,430
This is just a playground that we've created for you.

61
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,500
But once you contribute here, you can go off and contribute to all the other open source projects all

62
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,790
over GitHub they can find.

63
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,780
It can contribute to projects like React and Angular.

64
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,550
The world is your oyster.

65
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,270
Or you can just stick to these as we actually have a ton of projects here that are fun.

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,860
We have events going on like Octoberfest.

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,020
Well, we'll get to that shortly.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,940
We definitely have a great community of developers and we can create some awesome projects together.

69
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,270
Now the way you want to get started is to first go to the start here.

70
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,140
Guidelines.

71
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,550
Now in the start here guidelines and I'll link to this page.

72
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,030
You actually have a four step guide to get started.

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,130
The first thing you want to do is to actually watch the get started guideline.

74
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,610
A fellow student actually created this guide for you to follow the steps that I'll mention in this video.

75
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,890
So you always have this as a reference.

76
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,830
So after this video, definitely check out this document as a reference, but otherwise, once you've

77
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,020
browsed through, the document is, well, make your first pull request.

78
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,180
So if you've already watched my git and GitHub videos, you should be all set.

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,390
Otherwise, hopefully you're familiar with Git and GitHub.

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,770
Now the first thing we want to do is to actually add our names to the contributors dot MD file.

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,370
In this project.

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,950
So if you go up, you'll see that we have a contributor's MD which stands for Markdown File and if I

83
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:22,250
click on here, you see that all the contributors that we have, we have over 1000 contributors.

84
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,880
And if you scroll down, these are all their GitHub names.

85
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,320
So your first task is to actually add your name to this list.

86
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,300
So how can we do this?

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:41,180
Well, we can just clone this repository, but a more recommended way of usually contributing to open

88
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,850
source is to fork the project.

89
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:51,500
Fork essentially means copy over the entire project and put it on your own GitHub profile.

90
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,650
So if I click Fork here and we see over here that you can select where you want to fork the project

91
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,570
and you want to select your profile.

92
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,490
So once we fork this project, we make a copy of it.

93
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,370
It's like we own this repository now with our own version of the start here guidelines.

94
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:18,350
So once we have this, we can clone this repository using SSH or https, whatever you prefer.

95
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,670
In my case, I'll use SSH so that I don't have to use my password every time.

96
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,690
I can now say get clone and clone this repository.

97
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:36,550
Now we can CD and to start here guidelines and we can open this up in our favorite text editor.

98
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,950
Now, once here, let's clear this.

99
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,100
We have the contributors file which we need to add our name to.

100
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,770
Now you can see here the contributors file is getting quite long because while we've got a lot of students

101
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,510
who are contributing to open source.

102
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,310
But at the very end, make sure you're at the very end here.

103
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,040
You want to add your own name.

104
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,050
Now, here's the thing.

105
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,260
Right now we're on the master branch, but I'm going to show you what a good practice is.

106
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:19,300
We have our forked project and we want to create a new branch to work off of instead of master by saying

107
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:27,660
Get check out Dash B to create a new branch and we want to name this branch.

108
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,920
In our case, let's just name it test.

109
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,110
If I hit enter, you'll see that now I'm on a new branch called Test.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,909
And in this branch I can add my name to this contributor list.

111
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,600
In your case, you'll want to use your own GitHub profile.

112
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:52,100
So we're using markdown here, which is a way, a syntax to write and has some functionality.

113
00:08:52,130 --> 00:09:00,230
For example, if we go to the contributors list, you'll notice that they are all clickable links.

114
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,280
So we essentially use the same notation.

115
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:12,530
We do a dash square brackets with your GitHub username, and then in the parentheses we just have the

116
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,780
actual URL that you want to link to.

117
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,410
In our case, the GitHub username that you have.

118
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,680
So your GitHub username here, GitHub username here.

119
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:30,680
Once we do that, we can save this file and now go back to our terminal and say Get status.

120
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:40,040
And we see here that yeah, we just modified our contributors file and if I do get diff to see any changes

121
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,240
that we've made, we see that we've added this new line.

122
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,980
So let's clear this.

123
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,100
We have our name all set up and we can now add this commit by saying get add and dot for everything.

124
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:05,030
We'll add everything and then get commit and we'll write a message that says Added my name to contributor

125
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,020
list.

126
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,060
There we go.

127
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,730
So now it's time for us to push these changes.

128
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,620
Now if I do get push origin.

129
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,470
Master.

130
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,510
Well, right now, what that would mean is that we want to push to origin and the origin.

131
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,760
Is this start here.

132
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,680
Guideline which I forked.

133
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,550
So the origin is actually my version of the project and if I want to push to master, that is the main

134
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,300
branch.

135
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:50,880
But we don't want to do that because ideally we want to be able to also change and add our name to the

136
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,590
original zero to Mastery Star here guideline because this is the main.

137
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,930
Project.

138
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:06,650
So what we can do is instead of master push to our test branch so we say get push origin test.

139
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,250
There we go.

140
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,890
Now, if I go back here and go to my project and I refresh.

141
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,710
I now have two branches.

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,420
The Master branch and also the test branch, which I just updated.

143
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,970
So one way to do this is to click on New Pull request.

144
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:46,260
And you can add comments here like I've added my name to the list and you can tag some of our maintainers.

145
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,360
In my case, I'll just tag myself.

146
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,460
If I do create, pull, request.

147
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:03,260
I now have my poor request and notice here how my poor request is now at the zero to mastery start here

148
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,850
guideline so that if I go back to our start here guideline.

149
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,380
I see that I'm part of.

150
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,610
The pull request now.

151
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,590
Right here.

152
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,550
And because I've tagged one of the management teams.

153
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,460
So in this case it was myself or we can tag any of the management team that we have.

154
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,370
Now, in this case, I'm cheating because I also help manage this so I can just myself merge the pull

155
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:32,820
request.

156
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,420
Most likely in your case, you won't be able to merge it yourself.

157
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,630
But if I click merge and confirm.

158
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,140
There we go.

159
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,300
I've merged my project, I've deleted the branch and the pull request is closed.

160
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,420
If I want, I can even delete my own fork.

161
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,030
But for now, let's keep it the way it is.

162
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's check the start here guidelines and see if my name has been added to the list.

163
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,460
If I scroll all the way down.

164
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,320
Hey, check that out.

165
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,750
There's my name on the list.

166
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,750
So I've been added to the contributors list.

167
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,130
That was pretty easy, right?

168
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,430
And the cool part is that now if I go to my profile.

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,890
I actually have zero to mastery as one of my organizations.

170
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:29,760
So if you're able to add yourself to the contributors list, you can actually join the zero two Mastery

171
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,770
Organization and have this little icon appear on your GitHub profile.

172
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:41,730
And lots of GitHub profiles have organizations, so people usually have their workplace icon in here.

173
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,890
So it's just a nice little thing to have on your profile to show that you're involved in the programming

174
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,610
community.

175
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,720
So we've just made a poor request, which was step two, and that was pretty fast, right?

176
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,340
Finally, the next step is to go join an actual project and start contributing the way we just learned

177
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,770
in our Zero to Mastery Organization.

178
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,360
Now there's actually a guide that we provide it for you to figure out what project you choose, what's

179
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,620
going to be good for you.

180
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,870
We also have in our Discord a group projects section where we can look at some of the current projects

181
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,950
that are happening.

182
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:33,740
Or you can just go to the Zero to Mastery Organization and pick any of the repositories to contribute

183
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,130
to.

184
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,740
Now, in the next video, we're going to contribute to one of these projects and show you a real life

185
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,000
scenario.

186
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,830
I'll see in that one.

187
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,700
Bye bye.
