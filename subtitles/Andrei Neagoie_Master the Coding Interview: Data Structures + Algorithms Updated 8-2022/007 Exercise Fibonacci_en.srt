00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,920
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:08,870
You can't talk about recursion without talking about the Fibonacci sequence.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,990
What is the Fibonacci sequence?

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,520
Well, it's this.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,770
This sequence right here.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,880
The pattern, if you notice, is that we're always adding the first two items equals this one.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,490
So zero plus one equals one.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,610
One plus one equals two.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,220
One plus two equals three, two plus three equals five, so on and so forth, so on and so forth.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,110
So the previous two numbers always equals the current number.

11
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,620
So I have another exercise for you.

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,590
This one a little bit tougher than the previous one.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:57,580
Given a number and that the function is going to receive return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence.

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:08,850
So if I say that I want the DN to equal to, it's going to give me 012.

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,580
That is the number one.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,950
This function is going to return one.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,480
If I say Fibonacci number eight, I would get zero.

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,030
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,650
I would get 21.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,950
The function will tell me what number is associated with the index that I give it.

21
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,940
Once again, I have the iterative approach that is using just simple for loops.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,640
And also the recursive approach.

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,050
I challenge you to try both of these and see if you can do it.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:53,580
And a big hint here is that the recursive approach is actually easier than the iterative approach.

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,600
So good luck out there and I'll see you in the solution video.

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,740
Bye bye.
