00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.520
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's get into this section.

3
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.370
And the very first thing I want to talk about is mindset.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.100
You see, the biggest mistake that we made going into an interview is that, well, thinking that this

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.750
is your only chance.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.450
The way you walk into an interview is to walk in knowing that you have many other opportunities.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480
This is just one of them.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.400
It's not do or die.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.900
It's not pass or fail.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.080
If this interview goes wrong and you don't get the job, your life isn't over.

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.950
So first and foremost, treat everything as a learning experience.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.450
And what I mean by that is you go into the interview, whether it's a phone interview or an onsite interview.

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.750
Not expecting a job, not hoping for a job.

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.360
Don't hope for anything at all.

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.230
Just go to learn to see where your weaknesses are.

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.240
To learn about a company.

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.460
And as with anything, as if you're running code to check how good your code is, you just want to see

18
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.170
how good you are at interviews.

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.270
So that's the key.

20
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.200
This is not your only chance.

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.990
And if you go into that already, you're going to be less nervous.

22
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.150
You're going to be more comfortable.

23
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.380
It's going to help you out a lot.

24
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.340
I know it's silly.

25
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.180
I know it's one of those things that we all know, but I really do that.

26
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.100
Don't go into an interview nervous and thinking that, you know what, if I don't get this, then I'm

27
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.730
not good enough.

28
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.200
No, this is just another practice, another day at the office.

29
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.120
You just trying to get to where you want to be next.

30
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.140
Now, what about when you actually go into the interview for the first time and this is where interviewing

31
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.120
is a very similar to dating.

32
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.340
Your interviewer is more likely to be excited about interviewing you if you're excited as well, because

33
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.200
sometimes interviewers are people from human resources that do this every single day.

34
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.610
Or it could be other coders that are just taking time out of their day to interview you.

35
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.160
So you want to make this exciting and fun for them.

36
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.410
It's not all about you.

37
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.180
It's also about them as well.

38
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.320
And they want to see if they want to work with you.

39
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.590
This is a little trick that it sounds silly, but it really, really does work.

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.500
Your goal is to enter the room with a lot of energy, being happy, excited to be there.

41
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.350
And this is a classic psychological technique where humans, when we interact with each other, we match

42
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.650
each other's energy and energy level.

43
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.590
So if you're excited, if you're you're walking in there with a big smile, ready to get the interview

44
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.510
going, it's also going to jolt the interviewer to say, all right, let's do this, let's have fun.

45
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.180
Instead of just going there nervous and scary because the interviewer is going to match your energy.

46
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.370
So this is the trick.

47
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.430
Before you open that door, say to yourself, I'm about to go meet a really good friend like you've

48
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.530
known them for years, and by acting like that, you're going to make the interviewer like you more.

49
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.970
Again, it sounds silly, but it is a proven psychological technique.

50
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.800
Not only that, but excitement is a signal that you actually want this job.

51
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.500
So again, you're walking in about to meet your best friend and you're trying to make the interviewers

52
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.210
day not bore them to death.

53
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.730
And an interviewer wants to ask or answer three questions during this interview.

54
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.150
The first one we know, can you do the job?

55
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.980
Do you have the coding skills necessary?

56
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.050
Do you actually have the skills necessary?

57
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.250
But this isn't the only question you'll also have.

58
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.300
Well, can I work with you?

59
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.660
Is this the type of person that I want to be coworkers with?

60
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.720
Are they going to be fun to be around?

61
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.160
And this is a very important question that gets answered during this non technical questions.

62
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.330
And then the third one is, are you going to improve?

63
00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.840
Because most of the times when you get hired as a developer, you're not going to be 100% perfect match

64
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.440
for them.

65
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.020
On your first day, on your first week, the first month, you're learning on the job and learning their

66
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.430
ways, how their codebases work, how their best practices works.

67
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.310
And you're constantly improving and they're looking for people that can adapt quickly and learn and

68
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.279
a year from now become a really valuable asset.

69
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.820
The first question Can you do the job?

70
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.000
We're prepared for that because we just finished the coding section.

71
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.960
We know how to answer difficult technical questions, but these other two, we haven't really talked

72
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.440
about them.

73
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.480
And again, that's what we're going to cover here.

74
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.720
We're going to have the interviewer say yes to both of these last two questions.

75
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.950
This is what we call behavioral question.

76
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.270
Can I work with this person?

77
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.100
Is this person going to be fun to work with?

78
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.290
And are they the type of person that's constantly improving that's going to become better and better?

79
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.970
How do we do this?

80
00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.250
Well, for the rest of the section, I want you to keep in mind these four figures, what I call the

81
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.330
four heroes.

82
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.890
And I know it's silly.

83
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.510
It's going to be a little cartoonish.

84
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.850
But this way, hopefully you'll remember this.

85
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.960
You see, before you enter the interview, you have to have somewhere between 2 to 4 stories prepared

86
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.150
that I call the four heroes.

87
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.300
And it has to demonstrate to the interviewer that you have these four hero qualities that they're looking

88
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.720
for.

89
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.680
The first one is technical.

90
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.310
You want to have a story prepared about your past experience?

91
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.520
Maybe you worked on a really difficult project or a personal project that is going to impress the interviewer.

92
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:48.040
A story just for yourself that you know a lot about because you've worked on it and something that shows

93
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.110
the interviewer as soon as you tell the story that, Oh, this person is really technical and knows

94
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.770
their stuff.

95
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.890
So that's when we build that wanted to big project in our portfolio that we talked about at the beginning

96
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.690
of the course.

97
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.170
That's when this comes in.

98
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.010
So you want to demonstrate that you're very technical and smart.

99
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.390
That's the first zero.

100
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.620
The second one, success and this hero story shows you that you're a successful person if you build

101
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.430
something.

102
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.960
What did you do?

103
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.260
Did you maybe start a little app that turned out to be quite successful and it got a lot of users.

104
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.420
Maybe your past job, you got promoted to a senior level position.

105
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.390
You want to have some sort of story that shows you that you're a successful person, not a person that

106
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.100
never succeeds in any job.

107
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.710
The next one is leadership.

108
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.990
Are you the type of person that takes charge, doesn't get told what to do all the time, and can be

109
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.070
left on their own?

110
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.380
Do you have leadership qualities?

111
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.580
And then the last one is challenge.

112
00:06:51.580 --> 00:07:00.040
And challenge is they want to hear a story of you going through some really challenging things, maybe

113
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.040
a challenging technical problem that you had on a project and how you overcame it because you're a type

114
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.170
of person that when presented with something that is really difficult, that has no clear solution,

115
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.230
you can overcome it when left alone.

116
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.060
You can overcome any challenge.

117
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.860
And these four stories are going to be specific to you, so I can't really give you a story to tell

118
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.640
the interviewer Look, in your past experiences and I guarantee you, no matter what level of experience

119
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.090
you have, you'll have some stories from your past.

120
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.320
It could be from work.

121
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.460
It could be from projects.

122
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.400
It could be from other things where you're able to demonstrate these four heroes.

123
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.860
The rest of this section, the answers we're going to give, what we're going to talk about are all

124
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.230
going to demonstrate these four heroes.

125
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.550
We're not going to say to the interviewer, Oh, I'm a very successful person because I did this.

126
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.450
No, we're going to tell these stories that we have.

127
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.010
Remember, 2 to 4 stories that demonstrate these hero values.

128
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.960
And we're going to tell these stories and the interviewer is going to get that.

129
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.570
We have these four qualities, these four heroes, just through the stories.

130
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:19.260
And if you have these stories prepared before the interview, well, then you can always, depending

131
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:25.200
on what question you get asked, you can always answer your these questions with some sort of these

132
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.830
stories that you have because these stories are already prepared for you.

133
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.770
This is where I say that all non technical interviews sound the same because you have these stories

134
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.510
prepared and you just change them up a bit to answer the specific question.

135
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.159
But deep down inside you're just demonstrating these qualities.

136
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.700
Remember, these qualities are the qualities that we have to answer the last two questions, and that

137
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.390
is, can I work with this person and are you going to improve?

138
00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.320
So let's get into it and answer some questions that we might get asked in an interview.

139
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.240
I'll see you in the next one.

140
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.110
Bye bye.
