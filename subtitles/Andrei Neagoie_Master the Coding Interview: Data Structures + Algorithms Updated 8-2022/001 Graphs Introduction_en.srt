00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,510
Let's learn about the last data structure in this course graphs.

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,660
Graphs are one of the most useful and most used data structures in computer science when it comes to

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,550
modeling real life.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:23,600
In short, a graph is simply a set of values that are related in a pairwise fashion.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,260
And you can see over here, it looks like a little network.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,650
There's connections to different nodes.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,000
In a graph.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,730
Each item is called a node or a vertex.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,660
So this is a node.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,800
This is a node.

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,520
Nodes are then connected with edges.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,930
So that's an edge.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,180
That's an edge and that's an edge.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:58,600
And as you can imagine, graphs are great data structures to model real world relationships representing

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,840
links graphs ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect to other things.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,020
Kind of like how the internet works, right?

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:14,800
We can use graphs to represent maybe friendships, maybe family trees.

18
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:23,500
We can use graphs to represent networks and the World Wide Web, or we can use graphs to represent roads,

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,350
one city to another and the roads that connect it.

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,430
As you can imagine, Facebook uses it for their social network.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:38,740
Amazon uses it for their recommendation engines, and Google Maps uses graphs for determining the shortest

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,570
path to where you want to go.

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,490
So let me ask you a question.

24
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,470
Do you think this is a graph?

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,780
Well, yeah, obviously, we just went through it.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,980
What about this?

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,660
What about this?

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,700
And this and this?

29
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,990
What about this one?

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,340
All right, finally this.

31
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,450
Just getting a few more.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,470
This, this.

33
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,920
And this.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,550
And this.

35
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,580
Yep.

36
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,590
They are all graphs, even this one.

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,750
That kind of looks like a linked list.

38
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,430
That's a graph.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,520
And as you can see in our mind, map graphs and compass things that we've learned before, such as trees

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,690
and link lists.

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,010
Linked lists are a type of tree.

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,530
Trees are a type of graph.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,130
So in the next couple of videos, let's learn all about graphs.
