00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,100
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,800
We're going to answer a question that's kind of simple, kind of not depending on your situation.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,100
But I do get asked this question a lot, so I wanted to cover it.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,470
Where to find the jobs?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:23,490
Now, as an engineer, as a programmer, as a developer, we have the skills that are quite in demand.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:31,440
Most of the time you're not going to find difficulty or it won't be very difficult for you to actually

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,100
find companies that hire for your skill sets.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,070
The good news is that the better you get at programming, the better you become at engineering.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,580
Well, the more doors open up for you.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,310
So that's the good news.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,380
You can always improve your skills and we have a highly in-demand skill that allows us a lot of freedom.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,130
So when it comes to where to find the jobs, there is a ton of resources out there.

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,800
But I'm going to show you my favorite ones that I think are worth your time, because, again, there's

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,110
so many options that you want to focus on quality over quantity.

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's have a look.

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,810
The first one is LinkedIn and it's something we've already talked about.

17
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:23,000
But I really do think it's a great option that if this is available to you in your location, then you

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,010
should be using it 100%.

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,260
Another place that I like.

20
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,880
Is Hacker News.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,370
So Hacker News, a lot of engineers and programmers hang out there and they actually do a monthly who

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,700
is hiring section.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,700
You can see over here when I'm recording this video that they have.

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,490
Who is hiring.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,020
And it shows you all the companies or people comment with companies that are currently hiring right

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,470
now.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,890
Again, really, really good if you're interested, especially start ups, they sometimes have remote

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,580
jobs as well, which is really good.

29
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:03,980
Another great resource, if you're specifically looking for startups, then Angel List is probably the

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,000
best place to go.

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,520
So signing up for Angel List, creating a profile and finding a job.

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,640
You can work for some of the hottest startups right now.

33
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,930
If you're looking for remote jobs again, I'm going to leave a few more resources after this video.

34
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,480
But this is one of my favorite websites if you want to look for remote jobs.

35
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Again, they're becoming more and more common that no matter where you are in the world, as long as

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,680
you have an Internet connection, you can be a developer, a programmer, an engineer, and work from

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
a company that's thousands of kilometers away.

38
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,590
And I have more and more friends that work remotely as programmers now, because more companies are

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,040
becoming used to the idea of having remote workers.

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:02,260
Another interesting way to apply for jobs are companies like Hired Triple Bite or White Truffle.

41
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,220
They all have pretty cool sounding names except for hired.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,350
That's pretty generic.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,310
But what they do here is they actually have companies reaching out to them to hire good developers.

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,930
So you would take some sort of a quiz, a coding quiz with them.

45
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:25,160
They give you some sort of a rank and they create a profile for you so that companies reach out to them

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,670
and look at your score and hopefully hire you.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm not the biggest fan of these because it does take a bit of time to take these quizzes.

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,830
I like being direct and picking the companies that you want to apply for, but they do have some pretty

49
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,980
respectable companies that use some of these websites to hire people.

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:54,810
Then there's also meetups again, going to your local meet ups for a specific technology that you're

51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,920
working with is a great way to network, meet people from other companies and potentially see which

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,090
companies are hiring.

53
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,110
I personally am not a big fan of networking, doesn't seem genuine and kind of seems like I'm faking

54
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,710
relationship, but for other people it works really, really well.

55
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,100
Again, a great way to find people, connect with them, and especially get referrals.

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,420
Finally, one of my favorite ways is to do this type of search on Google.

57
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,290
You see over here, I have site, not state site.

58
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,650
LinkedIn dotcom.

59
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,470
So search LinkedIn and then search for Facebook recruiter.

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,050
If I want to apply at Facebook, well, I see over here Colleen Dunn.

61
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,660
And Juliana are regional recruiters recruiter at Facebook University.

62
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:57,690
Recruiter And I can find specific people that I want to get in touch with if I want to work at something

63
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,320
like Facebook.

64
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,990
And I can obviously change this to whatever I want.

65
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,510
And that's a great way to target your approach because remember.

66
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,860
Job hunting is a numbers game.

67
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:19,370
A 2% chance of getting an interview means all you need to do is apply to 50 places to get an interview

68
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
or something along those lines.

69
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,660
You just want to increase your percentage, your odds of getting that interview.

70
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,440
Keep that in mind.

71
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,130
Just applying to companies blindly is not a good idea.

72
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,580
I mean, you will get interviews, but it's not very efficient.

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,450
If you have companies you love or you want to work for a specific company, sometimes targeting your

74
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:50,310
approach and focusing in on that company is a lot better, more efficient way of spending your time.

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,140
Hopefully this was useful.

76
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:59,110
I'm going to list a bunch of these resources that I showed you and a few others in the next lesson.

77
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,640
And I'll see you in the next video.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,750
Bye bye.
