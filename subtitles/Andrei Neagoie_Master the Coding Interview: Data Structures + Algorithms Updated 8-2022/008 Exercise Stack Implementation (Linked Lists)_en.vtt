00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.760
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.820
It's time to code our own stack.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.060
And I have a little exercise for you here.

4
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.430
I've created the template of what we want our stack data structure to look like.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.370
And we also have a class of node if you decide to use that and you should be familiar with it from our

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.760
link list exercise, or you can just ignore it and then create a new node yourself in here.

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.350
Now this stack is going to have in its constructor three properties.

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.360
We have the top, which is remember the top plate, we have the bottom, which is the bottom plate,

9
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.050
and then we have length of zero and both top and bottom are currently null.

10
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.370
Now we're going to be using linked lists to fill these values, but we don't need to use the length

11
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.680
list class that we've used before.

12
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:09.080
Instead, you can just use the node class to simply assign different values and make sure that the dock

13
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.230
next points to a different node as we add things.

14
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.290
Now your task is to create three methods that work for this data structure.

15
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.120
PEEK Which lets us see the very top element.

16
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:37.420
Or top node, the push which lets us add a node to the top of the stack and a pop which lets us remove

17
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.100
from the top of the stack.

18
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.120
And if you want to optionally you can also do an is empty method which is common with a stack to check

19
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.750
that.

20
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.800
Our stack is empty.

21
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.730
We'll start off with a mistake that gets instantiated.

22
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.810
And your code works.

23
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:08.120
If it can do something like this where you say my stack, dot push, let's say Google, then push Udemy,

24
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.390
push discord just like a browser history.

25
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.470
And then you can pop discord, then pop Udemy.

26
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.670
Pop Google.

27
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.460
Good luck and I'll see you in the solution.

28
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.960
VIDEO Bye bye.
