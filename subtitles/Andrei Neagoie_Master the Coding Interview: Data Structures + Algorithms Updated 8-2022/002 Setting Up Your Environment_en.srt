1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,290
In this course.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,860
I don't want to limit you to just one language because we all code in different languages and throughout

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,880
your career you're most likely going to use multiple languages.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:20,020
Now, this course specifically, I will have to use a language to demonstrate code and write some code.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:26,680
And I'm going to use JavaScript for this because it is similar with a lot of common languages and it's

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,240
also the most well known.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,270
However, you can use whatever language you want in this course and follow along.

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,980
Even the exercises will give you solutions in different languages.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,860
So pick whichever one you want.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,340
But how are we going to run all these different languages when you're following along?

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,710
Maybe I'm demonstrating something in JavaScript and you're coding along in Python.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,370
Well, we're going to use a couple of neat little online tools.

13
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,700
The first one I'm going to show you and the one we're going to use in this course is ripple it, ripple

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,990
it, as I like to call it.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,970
And you can pick any language that you want here to code along.

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,530
And like I said, I'm going to be using JavaScript for this course.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:20,230
But all you need to do is to sign up with your GitHub account and you'll have a little ID that you can

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,160
run your code in and you'll see me using this throughout the course.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,250
Another one that I really like is glottal.

20
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,210
Oh.

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,350
And it's open source, which I'm a big fan of.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,150
And you can see over here that we have a lot of different languages that we can use.

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,460
Again, if I go to JavaScript, it gives me a nice little area for me to write code and run it.

24
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:53,510
Another option, especially if you're using JavaScript, is to just go to view developer and developer

25
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,640
tools and Google Chrome.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,650
And this allows you in the console tab to just write JavaScript.

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,520
So that's another great option.

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,930
Or if you prefer, you can always use your favorite text editor, write your code and then run it whichever

29
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,040
way you want.

30
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,370
Again, keeping in mind that this course is language agnostic, that means it doesn't matter what language

31
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,870
you use.

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,010
What we're learning are foundational computer science principles that you can take anywhere throughout

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,640
your career.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,090
And as you'll see, whether you know JavaScript or not, I'm going to keep the code very general and

35
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,720
simple so that it's easy to replicate it into other languages and also give you resources and sources

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,230
with other languages when we get into more nitty gritty coding.

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,960
All right, set up your environment.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,490
Get ready for some code.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,900
I'll see you in the next video.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,920
Bye bye.
