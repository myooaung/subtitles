00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.240
What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.280
Because as we learned in our previous lectures, data structures are simply ways to organize our data

3
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.360
on our computers.

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.970
And the data structures we'll see throughout this course are simply variations of how we store this

5
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.480
data on our computers, this information.

6
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.010
And each data structure has their trade offs.

7
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.000
Some are good at certain operations.

8
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.010
Others are good at other operations.

9
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.070
One type of action that we're going to perform with data structures well is insertion.

10
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:55.940
Add a new data item in a given collection of items such as us adding the Apple item and memory here.

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.080
Another one.

12
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.490
Well, deletion.

13
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.650
We want to sometimes delete data such as remove mango from our list.

14
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.320
Another type of action might be traversal and we're going to see this a lot.

15
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.420
Traversal simply means.

16
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.300
Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.

17
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.690
Another useful one is searching.

18
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.840
We want to find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection.

19
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.980
And then we also have things like sorting that is having data that is sorted kind of like it is on the

20
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.370
left hand side over here versus the right hand side where there's not much sorting going on, at least

21
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.390
from what we can see.

22
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.940
And obviously the main one and probably the most important is access.

23
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.160
How do we access this data that we have on our computer?

24
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.510
Now each data structure that we're going to go through in this course, we'll have different pros and

25
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.250
cons for each one of these.

26
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.410
And if we take a look at our big ogechi.

27
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.970
Well, we're very familiar with this diagram over here or this graph.

28
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.370
And if we scroll down, we have all these data structures that it lists and don't get to overwhelm.

29
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.180
We're going to go over most of these data structures and you see that half of them are mainly trees

30
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.560
and variation of trees.

31
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.340
And within here we see that each one of them has access, search, insertion, deletion, average and

32
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.210
worst case.

33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.360
And because we understand big o, we can see that.

34
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.900
All right.

35
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.640
We're seeing which ones.

36
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.660
Good for what?

37
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.120
And what is bad for what?

38
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.600
And as we go through our data structures, we're going to go over these pros and cons so that you build

39
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.220
the foundation to be able to decide which data structure should I use.

40
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.490
On your next problem, we're going to get started with our very first data structure in the next lesson.

41
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.200
I'll see you in that one.
