00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.710
Welcome back to our fourth and last item on the list emails.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.910
Now, if you're applying directly via a company's website or through a job board, please stop.

3
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.100
Well, all right.

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.280
Don't actually stop, but realize it's not the best way.

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.040
It's what everybody else does.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.120
There's a study that was published by a company called Impact Group, and they looked at some of the

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.800
job applications and did some statistics around those numbers, and they found that close to 30% of

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.960
hires made by organizations actually came from referrals.

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.390
So that is employees referring their friends or somebody that they know to the company.

10
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.920
It was the number one way of companies to hire other people.

11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:01.460
And again, part of this study also discovered that 46% of men and 39% of women actually find their

12
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.830
jobs, most of their jobs through networking.

13
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.220
The interesting thing is that the higher your salary, the more effective networking becomes and getting

14
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.940
a referral.

15
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.580
For most companies, the best way to get an interview is not only through online job boards, but the

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.030
best way to get an interview is through referrals.

17
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.170
But lucky for you, this doesn't have to be an actual friend or a coworker.

18
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.150
Usually you can message people within a company using some of the tools that I'm going to show you.

19
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.930
All right.

20
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.480
Let's get started and show you the first example.

21
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.360
All right.

22
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.010
The first way.

23
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.220
Well, the most obvious way is to actually apply to companies where your friends and colleagues can

24
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.040
refer you.

25
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.820
But maybe that's not the case for everybody.

26
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.930
And that's kind of rare, as I've shown you in the LinkedIn video.

27
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.710
There are ways for you to actually connect with employees through LinkedIn and message them based on

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.090
who you're connected with.

29
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.720
And you can usually send them a polite or smart email.

30
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.680
And this is an example template that I'll share with you that I actually a user Patrick McKenzie on

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.960
Hacker News shared and it's a it's a really really good piece of text I'm not going to read it out for

32
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.800
you but you can see over here a short email to get yourself a referral or at least talk to some of the

33
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.540
developers at the company or some of the key players that might get you an interview.

34
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.940
But again, how can we solve this problem of finding the people to contact?

35
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.050
Well, the one way to do this is using LinkedIn.

36
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.710
Like I showed you, I can see what jobs let's say Netflix is hiring for.

37
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.520
I can see some of their employees here.

38
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.420
I can see that I have some connections here from my school.

39
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.070
So that's an easy way.

40
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.290
But what if you're not able to use LinkedIn or able to find these connections?

41
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.020
There's some great tools that you can use to find in this day and age, pretty much anybody's email.

42
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.080
And I'll link to this after this lesson.

43
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.220
But you have a lot of plug ins, such as this one over here that finds emails of LinkedIn profiles.

44
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.920
You have Hunter over here that you go on a website and it shows you what emails are associated with

45
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.580
the website and other tools like Email Extractor.

46
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.100
Using that, you can target somebody that might be a gatekeeper.

47
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.090
That is somebody that can make the decision to interview you or not interview you or can refer you to

48
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.700
somebody that has that decision.

49
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.150
Because nothing beats getting a referral from someone.

50
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.800
And the other beauty is that most big companies have incentives for employees who refer someone.

51
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.010
So they may actually be willing to help you.

52
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.180
What do I mean by that?

53
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.470
For example, my past company, if you are able to refer a developer, you got an extra bonus on that

54
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.550
month's salary because they're always looking for good employees.

55
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.250
And they know that referrals usually turn out to be better candidates than somebody that just applies

56
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.410
randomly online by contacting some of the people that might be able to refer you.

57
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.959
They actually may be interested as well because they might get a bonus from the company for referring

58
00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.970
somebody that they're going to hire and thus improve the company.

59
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.120
Keep in mind that you don't have to just do this online.

60
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.290
You can meet people at meetups that you might have locally or even hackathons where you can meet people

61
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.220
in real life and ask them if the company they work for is hiring.

62
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.460
There's just so many ways to do it and be smart about it.

63
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.890
Again.

64
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.480
Nothing beats getting a referral from someone that just blindly sending out a resume.

65
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.640
But let's go back to the slides.

66
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.460
The methods we just discussed for emailing and getting referrals are pretty basic.

67
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.120
So let's get creative.

68
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.060
Instead of sending your resume.

69
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.640
I usually email a company I'm interested in.

70
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.010
And again, you can use some of the free tools that I showed you, such as Email Hunter and instead

71
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.390
of sending a resume.

72
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.960
Instead, send them a personal website that you have a portfolio, why you want to work for that company

73
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.230
and ask them if you can come by for an interview, just ask them outright.

74
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.370
You can send this message to the head of HR or human resources person or somebody on the development

75
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.750
team another way or even more creative way.

76
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.470
Well, message lead developers or CTOs, somebody in charge of the developers or engineers at the company

77
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.560
that you're interested in working for them and let them know that you're interested in getting where

78
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.810
they are professionally.

79
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.270
Ask them to take them for coffee or lunch or ask them if you can come by to the office to chat with

80
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.910
them about their careers so you can learn from them.

81
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.910
People love talking about themselves and if you're not outright asking for a job, instead you just

82
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.430
want to pick their brain or learn from them.

83
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.760
You might be surprised how often you'd get the yes.

84
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.110
Come by and let's have coffee.

85
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.520
The key here is to just not ask them for a job.

86
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.330
And at the end of meeting them, perhaps inquire if they have anybody that they recommend you speak

87
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.720
to.

88
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.170
If they're not looking to hire, they'll direct you to someone else.

89
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.550
And then finally, another way that I like reaching out is to perhaps message CEOs directly or president

90
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.330
of a company.

91
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.850
And this is something that works with smaller companies, big, large companies.

92
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.420
This most likely won't work.

93
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.200
But if you message a CEO of a startup and ask perhaps what technical problems they having.

94
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.820
Tell them what technologies you are an expert in and ask to solve a real life problem that they have.

95
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.070
Free of charge.

96
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.360
They can keep the work.

97
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.480
And in return, all you ask for is an interview.

98
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.380
I mean, they might take you up on it because.

99
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.460
Hey, why not?

100
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:02.240
I remember one time when I was a little younger, I messaged the CEO of a really big travel company

101
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.670
saying that the book that they wrote really inspired me and that I'm starting my own travel company.

102
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.600
And the CEO and I actually had a meeting and we spoke for about 2 hours discussing whether I should

103
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.310
join his company or not.

104
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.900
And I never asked him for a job.

105
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.880
It was just something that I sent out again, doing things that most people wouldn't do.

106
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:30.650
But at the end of the day, the point of this is to not necessarily send out massive amounts of resume.

107
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.260
Select the jobs that you want, personalize your emails, and try to avoid sending a resume if it can

108
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:43.110
try to bypass formalities of the application process by trying to get an interview right away.

109
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.050
Most likely during the interview they will ask you for a resume, but by that point it doesn't really

110
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.490
matter.

111
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.090
You've already gotten what you wanted.

112
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.840
The interview.

113
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:57.640
By the way, you may have noticed that this is why cover letters should be an email to introduce yourself.

114
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:04.600
Cover letters should actually be just directed at someone and personalize, so don't bother creating

115
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.620
a generic one.

116
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:14.500
They're just simply emails to reach out to somebody, to get referrals to get that interview, just

117
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.410
write an email or any way to get connected to show how you can help solve their problems.

118
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.300
I'll see you in the next video.

119
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.320
Bye bye.
