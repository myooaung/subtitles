00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.660
Let's talk about portfolios.

3
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.630
And actually, we kind of spoke about this already on our video about what if you don't have enough

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.440
experience.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.230
So I'm just going to go over a few things.

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.350
So I recommend you make sure you watch that video first.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.210
Otherwise, let's just recap what our portfolio should be.

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:31.240
A portfolio is simply a way for you to showcase your big projects, the items that you want to really

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.200
demonstrate your value with, to talk about in the interview.

10
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.500
Those personal projects should reflect what kind of job you want.

11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.990
So don't spend a lot of time on your portfolio.

12
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.070
It doesn't really matter that much how it looks unless you're a designer using a free resource like

13
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.450
the one I showed you that gives you free templates where you can list your projects is enough for you

14
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.760
to just have an online link on your resume and for recruiters to possibly see that you have some sort

15
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.990
of an online presence.

16
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.030
So using something like this or creative team is a great way to just speed up that process.

17
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.260
Remember, the projects inside this portfolio is what matters most.

18
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.250
You just need to have 1 to 2 big projects you really care about.

19
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.010
I've actually never met a developer that has gotten a job solely because they had a nice portfolio.

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.230
So don't stress too much about it.

21
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.710
Remember, your goal is just to be seen just to get that interview.

22
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.650
Your portfolio can be quite simple.

23
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.450
You just want to make sure that it looks someone nice and that it also loads up fast.

24
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.280
And you just need a place to showcase your main projects.

25
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.950
A place maybe to add your blog posts.

26
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.770
Maybe to add your GitHub account and I'll leave a nice resource for you for some of the best portfolio

27
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.690
websites, but they all pretty much look the same.

28
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.910
A little above me section links to GitHub and blog posts and just a list of your projects.

29
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.420
You can even have your resume on this portfolio.

30
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.370
And by the way, once you're done with your portfolio, I recommend you add it to the job board that

31
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.920
we have here so that you can showcase it for other students of the course.

32
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.940
But I also include this on my LinkedIn profile so that when recruiters see my profile, they can just

33
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.380
search for developers that they need based on name, job, title, location, and it's just a nice way

34
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.690
to get seen or have at least another avenue to be discovered.

35
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.410
And that's it.

36
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.150
Again, spend very little time, but just have something out there.

37
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.190
I also recommend going to our zero to Mastery Community and actually going to the job hunting section.

38
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.680
And we might have a few more channels by the time you watch this video, but you can check out other

39
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.350
people's profiles as well as talk about job hunting and people sometimes share job openings here.

40
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.610
This is a great place to ask for help, get tips and maybe help out community members as well as we

41
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.070
all try and get that dream job.

42
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.080
Anyway.

43
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.310
I'll see you in the next one.

44
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.090
Bye bye.
