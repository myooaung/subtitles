00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.480
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.440
I have a fun little exercise for you.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.780
And now you're asking yourself, Andre.

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.640
You say all the exercises are fun.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.470
You are a big liar.

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.210
All right.

7
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.940
Fair point.

8
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.060
But I think this one is going to be fun, so stick with me.

9
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.130
I want you to write a function, actually, to functions that finds the factorial of any number.

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.660
Now.

11
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.960
Why?

12
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.030
Two functions.

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:34.500
Well, one function is going to be recursive using what we just learned, where we have to create a

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.270
base case, we have to follow the steps.

15
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.750
Right.

16
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.860
If we go back, we have to identify a base case and a recursive case and then finally make sure that

17
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.170
we return both cases.

18
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.150
So this recursive function is going to return an answer.

19
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.330
But what is a factorial?

20
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.620
A good way to think about factorial is this notation five exclamation mark.

21
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.870
Factorial simply means multiply five times four times three times two times one.

22
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.470
You keep going down one by one, multiplying each number until you get to one.

23
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.620
So six factorial will be six times.

24
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.160
Five times four times three times two times one.

25
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.360
And you'll notice here that it's a recursion pattern that we're doing.

26
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.560
We call the function.

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.440
And we have two cases that can happen.

28
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.250
We have the base case to stop or recursive case and so on and so forth.

29
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.240
And we keep going, keep going, keep going until we hit one.

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.510
So I want you to build a function that does this for us.

31
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.310
I'm going to write the function factorial.

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.810
You're going to put in five and it's going to run through this.

33
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.470
But remember our definition of recursion.

34
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.699
Recursion is when you define something in terms of itself.

35
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.990
Now, a good way to think about factorial is this.

36
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.460
Five factorial is simply five times four factorial.

37
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.930
You see over here, five times four factorial is factorial.

38
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.440
Five.

39
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.490
Five times, four times three factorial, four times three is five factorial because four times factorial

40
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.950
three equals factorial four.

41
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.160
And you see here how we might have a recursion function that we can write using this knowledge.

42
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.330
See if you can create a function that allows you to do this.

43
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.430
Now, when it comes to this question, there's two ways that you can go about it.

44
00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.930
You can do the recursive approach where the function calls itself, or you can do the iterative approach,

45
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.490
which means looping.

46
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:11.160
And most of you are probably going to find it easier to solve it with this way with just a four loop,

47
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.030
for example.

48
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.480
I'm going to leave this up to you to figure out, see if you can do both functions and see if they give

49
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.440
you the right number.

50
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.560
And in the next video, I'll show you the answer.

51
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.000
I'll see you in that one.

52
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.780
Good luck.
