Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.110
What are the pros and cons of graphs?

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.700
Well, when it comes to performance and Big O, it gets a little bit complicated because there are so

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.560
many different types of graphs.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.150
You can think of graphs as really useful when it comes to relationships.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.260
They're simply indispensable because some data just needs to be in a graph form.

7
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.290
There's no other way around it.

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.000
And there are algorithms around graphs such as the ones that we're going to be talking about in the

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.550
algorithm section that allows us to perform operations such as finding the shortest path or traversing

10
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.210
a graph.

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.790
But when it comes to graphs, because they can get complicated, scaling is pretty hard.

12
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.020
You need a big company or at least a lot of resources and engineering power to make sure that you build

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.050
graph data structures that scale well.

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:10.080
But luckily for us, you usually will never have to implement your own graph in production, or at least

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.360
for 99% of the population.

16
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.100
There are tools like Neo Forge, which is a popular database that allows you to build really fast graph

17
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.120
databases.

18
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.500
And most of the time you'll use tools like this to build complex structures to contain our data.

19
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.270
Congratulations.

20
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.920
We've now covered another part of our data structure mind map.

21
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.200
That is graphs we learned about cyclic, acyclic, weighted, unweighted, direct it or undirected.

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
We are also able to build our own graph.

23
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.570
Now there's still a few things left that I see up there and perhaps over here, which we're going to

24
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.400
get into in the algorithm section.

25
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.190
But for now, take a break, drink some coffee or tea, and I'll see you in the next video.

26
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.210
Bye bye.
