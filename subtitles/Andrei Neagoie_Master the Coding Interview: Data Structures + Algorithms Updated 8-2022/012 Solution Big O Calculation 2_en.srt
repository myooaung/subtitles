1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,600
Now that we have a better understanding of how to calculate big oh, let's look at another exercise

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,570
that should be a little bit easier than the first one that we did.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,330
What would you say that the big o of this is?

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:24,400
Well, if we go one by one, we see here that we have ov one again ov one.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,670
And you know what?

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,340
If I keep typing, this is going to get tiresome.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,450
So I'm just going to copy and paste.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,530
So all of one here, we're just assigning variables.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,020
And then we also see here that we have.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,890
A four loop that is running based on the input.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,770
We don't know what that input is, but we can just assume that we're looping based on however long this

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,550
input is, in which case we're running each one of these.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,490
Oh.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,490
Of end times or whatever long the input is.

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,150
So again, these are going to be run of in and of end times.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,450
And if we go down here again, same thing, we don't know what the input is, but these are being run

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,620
of end times.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:24,630
And then finally, this last line is just run once, so it'll be o of one.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,440
So looking at this function, another font challenge function, we see that r o when our big o.

20
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,490
Is one, two, three, four.

21
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,950
So we have four.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,670
Plus because we're just adding up the steps here.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,380
We have over and that's happening.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,820
One, two, three, four, five.

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,930
So five and.

26
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:05,330
So the big O here is we have four constant times and then five things that we're doing.

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,030
End times.

28
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,570
Or however long the input is.

29
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,640
All right.

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,320
That wasn't so bad, was it, compared to the first time around?

31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,570
I think you're starting to get the hang of this.

32
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,480
So let's dive into the next video.

33
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,270
Let's start to figure out how we can simplify things for us so that we're not doing this mathematical

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,650
step by step count.

35
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,180
I'll see you in the next video.

36
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,170
Bye bye.
