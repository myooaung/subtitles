00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.050
A question that you're going to get asked at every interview that you do.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.700
Tell me about yourself.

3
00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.560
What should you say?

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.390
And I'm going to leave this on the screen so you can just read it on your own.

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.840
But this is something that should be already prepared and you're ready to answer and really nail it.

6
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.690
How can we answer this question successfully?

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.700
You see, this is the chance for you to steer the conversation in the direction that you want, in the

8
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.360
prepared stories of the four heroes that you want.

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.440
Remember, you're going to direct the rest of the conversation after they ask you this question to what

10
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.960
you want them to ask you so you can shine.

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.640
Some of the key takeaways here.

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.560
You want to answer this question in about a minute.

13
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.260
If you go too long into it, well, the interviewer is going to get bored.

14
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.390
And if you go too short, then they don't get enough of a chance to get to know you.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.510
The key here is for you to tell your hero's journey how you went from very little skill to somebody

16
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.770
that they want to hire.

17
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.630
Think of it like a movie.

18
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.870
You want to talk about your triggers of success within this minute, you want to demonstrate that you're

19
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.070
a successful person.

20
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.480
You also want to slightly discuss maybe your past projects, your past companies, so that you get asked

21
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.290
questions about these projects or past companies by the interviewer.

22
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.030
Because keep in mind, the interviewer is going to ask follow up questions based on this.

23
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.120
And when you talk about yourself, maybe it's interesting that you were an origami master five years

24
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.170
ago, but it might not matter to the interviewer.

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.430
So make sure that your stories, your hero's journey is relevant to the job.

26
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.710
And you mentioned some of the skills that you're going to be working with at this job within this minute.

27
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.360
You want to demonstrate that they will be extremely lucky to have you and how everything you've done

28
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.430
in the past makes this a perfect role for you.

29
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.300
And keep in mind that an interviewer may not have even looked at your resume.

30
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.600
So have a story prepared.

31
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.190
Something difficult you did and what you did to solve that and what impact it had.

32
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.110
You don't need to talk about your life story, how you went to elementary school, then high school.

33
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.530
Just keep it short and to the point, but make sure you stand out from the crowd.

34
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.340
Everybody might be able to code in JavaScript, but what did you do that makes you stand out?

35
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.100
And that's something that you all are going to have to answer on your own.

36
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.970
Keep in mind that this type of question, there's different variations on it.

37
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.120
Some people ask.

38
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.660
Walk me through your resume or why are you leaving your current job?

39
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.310
Or many other variations?

40
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.480
Essentially, they just want to hear the story of why you're here.

41
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.650
And as an example, here's what I would say.

42
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.590
If let's say you have zero experience, you just tie yourself to code and this is your first job interview.

43
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.290
You can say something along the lines of.

44
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.210
Well, I got really interested in coding a couple of years back when I would start this small little

45
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.830
side businesses, and I would hire developers and designers to build a website or an app for me.

46
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.250
And it was always a black box where I would pay this developer money and they will come back with a

47
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.840
product that I was never fully satisfied for.

48
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.850
So I started teaching myself how to code because I wanted to know how this black box works.

49
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.760
And the more I learned, the more I learned.

50
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.640
I became really interested, really engulfed in the programming landscape.

51
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.900
And I just started consuming as much information as I can, practicing as much as I can.

52
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.490
I started building projects and then this is where you can talk about some of your big portfolio projects.

53
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:05.470
And all of a sudden I started writing blog posts about technical subjects that got received very well.

54
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.110
And I guess what I'm trying to say is that through these projects and through these posts, every day

55
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.019
I'm becoming better and better as a coder to the point that now I feel very confident and being able

56
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.680
to be a valuable asset to your team, not just now, but even a year from now, where I expect my skills

57
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.150
to exponentially grow.

58
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.010
And this is just an example that I came up with at the top of my head.

59
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.710
But you see here how I touched on all three points.

60
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.350
Shows that I'm successful, that I've had passed businesses in the past, how I've taught myself how

61
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.270
to code because of an interest that I had.

62
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.150
So I'm the type of person who's a go getter.

63
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.740
I also mentioned a few things I want to get asked, such as blog posts everyday, maybe projects.

64
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.370
I've worked on my personal projects that I've put into my portfolio, and I also talked about skills

65
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.210
relevant to the job.

66
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.620
Maybe this was a position related to web development or building an app.

67
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.010
And this is something you can tweak.

68
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.410
But the key thing is to have this prepared and remember, you want to stand out.

69
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.510
Don't say things that all the other developers are saying or programmers are saying.

70
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.690
If you did something amazing in your life, even if it is encoding related, try to work it into the

71
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.600
interview and that way you'll be more memorable.

72
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.240
And this is going to set the stage for the rest of the interview.

73
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.560
So good luck out there and I'll see you in the next video.

74
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.580
Bye bye.
