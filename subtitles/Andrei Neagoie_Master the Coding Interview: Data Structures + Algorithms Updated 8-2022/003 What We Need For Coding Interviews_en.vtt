00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.740
In order to solve coding problems, we need to learn these data structures and these algorithms.

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.930
It doesn't look that bad, does it?

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.130
Here's the big secret.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.560
There are a lot more data structures than this and a lot more algorithms than this.

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.070
But just like when you learn a new language, you don't read through the dictionary and learn every

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.610
single word in that dictionary and that language.

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.030
Instead, you focus on being able to communicate with others.

8
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
You only focus on things that are being used most of the time.

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.230
And when it comes to data structures and algorithms, these are where you're going to get asked on in

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.700
interviews, because these are the ones that get used the most and 90% of the time to solve a really

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.720
complex problem.

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.850
You're only using these things.

13
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.440
Doesn't look that bad, does it?

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
All you need is the baseline skills.

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.260
And companies just want to know that you prepare for the interview and can succeed within their system.

16
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.770
A lot of people complain about coding interviews or whiteboard interviews and how useless they are because

17
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
they never use some of these algorithms or data structure in their day to day job.

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.480
But they're just a way to weed out people that aren't willing to work hard.

19
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.620
Look at this as an advantage.

20
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.160
Not many people work on their interview questions.

21
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.160
You're going to work harder than 99% of the people out there because you know that getting a good job

22
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.950
will have a big impact on your life.

23
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.050
And I mean, that's why you're taking the course.

24
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.360
And as you see here, the good news is that it's not as hard as you think.

25
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.490
You just have to put your time and effort into the right things.

26
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.140
As long as we learn our right data structures, when and why to use them, how to implement them, how

27
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.250
to solve problems with them.

28
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.870
And same with algorithms.

29
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:04.420
And we combine it with our cheat sheet that I'll create for you when we compare our code that is readable,

30
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.680
that is memory efficient and time efficient using big O between these two.

31
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.300
That's all interviews are.

32
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.180
That's all coding interviews ask for.

33
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.130
If we go back to our outline of the course, we're now getting into the technical interview section

34
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.800
and when I click over here, it's going to look overwhelming at first and we're going to go over this

35
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.580
diagram.

36
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.440
So it all make sense.

37
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.330
We're going to talk about different data structures that we have.

38
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.710
Let's zoom in a bit here.

39
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.550
You can see we're going to talk about arrays, trees, stacks and graphs and a lot more.

40
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.530
We're going to talk about the big o of each one of these data structures.

41
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.700
We're going to talk about different algorithms when to use what.

42
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.530
And like I said, this is going to look overwhelming at first, but we're going to go through this step

43
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.970
by step so that at the end, all of this makes sense to you.

44
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.890
We're also going to use the cheat sheet right over here to help us solve these coding problems.

45
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.570
Now, in this cheat sheet, we've already covered the three pillars of good code.

46
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.230
We already talked about what skills the interviewer is looking for, but we haven't talked about this

47
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.920
part.

48
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.070
So let's start with this section in the next video.
