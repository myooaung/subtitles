00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.930
All right, another section done.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.350
And in this section, we talked about the technical interviews and how to solve problems specifically.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.270
One big misconception is that you're either a good problem solver or you aren't.

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.700
But as with anything, it's a muscle that you can train, that you can practice.

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.480
So with enough practice and knowing the tips and tricks that we covered in this section, you can solve

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.430
problems a lot better.

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.850
That shows the interviewer You know what you're talking about.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.830
The key in this section was this cheat sheet and the step by step walk through of a problem.

9
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.280
We looked at how a Google interview might look like and then we mimicked some of the techniques used

10
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.320
there to solve our own problem.

11
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.940
The idea was to show how you work, think out loud and try to comment the steps as you go along to solve

12
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.570
a problem.

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.319
Communicating throughout the process as much as possible and not worrying about finishing a problem

14
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:11.730
fast is the key to interviewing and solving problems in an interview now, we should have also gotten

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.930
the idea that we don't want to memorize problems because if you do 100 problems and try to memorize

16
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.350
them.

17
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.430
Well, it won't really help you long term, but you're also taking a gamble, right?

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.180
You're hoping the interviewer asks you a question that you've seen before.

19
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.960
Instead, we want to take control of our destiny and practice and be ready for anything by building

20
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.010
the fundamentals.

21
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.120
We talked about how by using the big O and the lessons we learned here, we can now move on to data

22
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.890
structures and algorithms and use them during our code interviews.

23
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.670
We also talked about some of the skills that interviewers are looking for and demonstrated how it wasn't

24
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.350
necessarily just coding skills.

25
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.590
There's a lot of other aspects that interviewers are looking for and we cover these items and how to

26
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.100
show them during our practice interview question.

27
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.040
Finally, we're now ready to dive into the exciting part of data structures and algorithms.

28
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.730
We have a nice foundation and we know that all we need is to learn these data structures and algorithms

29
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.890
to really be interview ready.

30
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.830
And we're also going to be using the cheat sheet that I gave you in this section throughout the rest

31
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.700
of the course.

32
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.230
And at the foundation of this cheat sheet is the idea of readability of code space, complexity of code

33
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.510
and time, complexity of code.

34
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.740
And although we don't cover everything in the cheat sheet, we have a few items here at the end.

35
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.890
You'll see that as we go through the data structure and algorithm questions, certain type of patterns

36
00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.300
will emerge that although questions may be different in an interview, usually the way to optimize things

37
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.370
or tricks to make your answers better can be narrowed down to specific steps.

38
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.800
So don't get overwhelmed.

39
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.080
There's an easy, clear checklist and heuristics that we're going to go over later on.

40
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.080
But by this point, I think we're ready to move on to data structures and algorithms.

41
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.910
How do we write good code, create good programs, create value for the companies that we're interviewing

42
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.300
for?

43
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.660
See you in the next section.

44
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.800
Bye bye.
