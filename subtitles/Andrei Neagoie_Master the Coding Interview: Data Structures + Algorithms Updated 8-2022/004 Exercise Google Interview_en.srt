00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,410
We're going to do a fun little exercise here.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,320
Now, instead of me just reading off what I wrote, I have a little ask for you.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,840
You're going to use this cheat sheet and look at the step by step through a problem, which is a 15

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,240
step guide of what you should do when you're in a coding interview to solve a problem.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,230
And I want you to use this as you watch a little video.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,790
Now this video.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,430
Is actually produced by Google and it demonstrates it's 24 minutes.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,230
So it's a little bit long, but it demonstrates how you should answer a coding interview.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,240
And in my opinion, this is the best coding interview that I've ever seen.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
Now I want you to watch this.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,940
And keep in mind that because we haven't learned data structures and algorithms yet, this is going

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,210
to be quite difficult for you to understand.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,700
And that's the goal here.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,460
When you watch this, it's going to be really, really hard to follow the actual coding, maybe some

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,019
of the language that they use.

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,330
I believe they're writing the code in C++.

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,490
So if you don't know C++, it might be difficult.

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,840
But that's not the point.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,220
The point for you here is to watch this video.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,260
But also read the step by step through a problem and see how the interview e.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,220
In this case in this video follows these steps.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,370
And these steps are what you're going to do when you solve a problem in a coding interview.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,010
The fun thing is that at the end of this course, we're going to revisit the video.

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,930
This video.

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,850
And you're going to notice a difference from this very first time that you're going to watch this video

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,590
to the very end where what the interviewee does becomes second nature.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,140
You understand what they're coding in, what they're doing to solve the problem and all these little

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,180
steps so that I succeed.

30
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:06,650
If you completely get this video and you understand how to run a successful interview at a company like

31
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,110
Google or any large company or maybe even startup, depending on what you like.

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,020
So to get started, I'll be right back.

33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,520
You go watch this video.

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,500
You follow the 15 steps.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:26,090
And after this, we're going to do a little problem of our own and follow the guide, the 15 step guide

36
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,160
to solve our own little problem.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,660
I'll see you in that one.

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,860
Bye bye.
