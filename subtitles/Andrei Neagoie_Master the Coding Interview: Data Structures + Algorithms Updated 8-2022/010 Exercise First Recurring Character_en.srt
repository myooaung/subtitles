Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,480
It's time for an exciting interview.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,870
QUESTION And this question comes straight from Google.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,560
Given an array, let's say, that looks like this.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,950
Tell me the first recurring character.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,210
What does that mean?

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,060
Well, if we look at this array over here.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,620
I want a function that I can enter this array.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:30,730
This input is going to look through all the numbers and tell me which one gets repeated first.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:40,850
So we look at two, five, one and two, and we say a two has already been seen.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,570
Two is the recurring number.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,570
If we look at another example, we see two, one, one and we stop here because one we've already seen

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:51,960
before.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,200
We can say the first recurring character is one.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:02,580
If we get an array that has all unique items, we just return on undefined.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,410
So how would you go about solving this?

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,880
Give it a go.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,560
See what you come up with.

19
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,580
If you need help, perhaps go on discord and chat with some of the community members and I'll see you

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,810
in The Solution video.
