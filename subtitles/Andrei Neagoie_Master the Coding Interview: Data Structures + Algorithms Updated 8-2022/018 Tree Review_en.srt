00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,689
Although there are a ton of trees, as you saw, and we even talked about a lot of trees.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,740
The way they work, though, beyond some small logic, such as the differences you saw in binary search

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,890
trees and binary heaps and priority queues, as long as you understand how to build one from scratch

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:28,830
like we did, the small variations are fairly easy to pick up so that now you have the ability to construct

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,170
other trees as needed.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,000
Remember that Wikipedia page with a ton of tree data structures?

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,120
They shouldn't look as intimidating to you anymore.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,960
At the end of the day, they're just tree structures with a few different rules apply to them.

9
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,850
Something that you should easily be able to do with a bit of research now.
