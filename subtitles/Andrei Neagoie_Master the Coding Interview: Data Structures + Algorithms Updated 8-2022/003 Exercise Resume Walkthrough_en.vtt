00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.130
It's time for a fun little exercise.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.310
Well, I mean, resumes are never fun, but I'm going to try and make this fun.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.000
I might succeed my nut.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.860
Let's have a look.

6
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.410
Before we get started, I have a resume cheat sheet for you that we're going to go through.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.300
And this is what you can do.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.150
I've simplified everything so that you do these items and you're already above average with your resume

9
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.260
and you're going to see some increase in the number of interviews you're going to get.

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.090
But before we get into that, I want to show you again this website that we already talked about.

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.140
The resume maker.

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.990
Online.

13
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.510
Now I like this website because it shows you what part the interviewer actually cares about or the recruiter

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.680
actually cares about.

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.460
If you look over here, we see that, we see the title, we see professional experience, maybe a bit

16
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.950
of education, and then the left hand side.

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.420
I don't think you need birth, date or nationality, but you get the idea.

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.390
A recruiter usually only checks out the main points and from there, if they're interested in you,

19
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.470
they'll read further.

20
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.910
But you want to focus on these main points where a recruiters eyes are going to be drawn so that right

21
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.130
away, within the first second, they see that you're a qualified candidate.

22
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.220
So keeping that in mind, let's go over the points.

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.930
All right.

24
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.470
So I have the cheat sheet here and I have here a demo resume that I just randomly found online.

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.740
Now, before we get started here, let me make this a little bit bigger so you can see.

26
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.160
You can pause the video here and have a look at this resume and see how you might want to improve it.

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.900
Or you can even bring up your own resume so that as we go along with each point, you can critique your

28
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.500
resume.

29
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.970
All right, so pause the video.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.620
Otherwise, I'm going to get started.

31
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.460
Now this resume cheat sheet, the first item on it is, does it use a predesigned resume template?

32
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.650
And if we take a look at this resume.

33
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.160
Well.

34
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:16.040
I mean, it looks like somebody just wrote it in Microsoft Word with the most basic font, and it doesn't

35
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.530
look very pretty right away.

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.250
If I'm a recruiter looking at this, I'm not going to be impressed and I'm going to associate low skills

37
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.250
with a person that doesn't have a well designed resume.

38
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.180
So again, you might want to use a tool like the one I showed you that has predesigned templates so

39
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.040
everything looks good and professional so we can fix that resume that way.

40
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.300
Nice and easy fix.

41
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.860
What about the next one?

42
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.120
Make the resume fit on one page.

43
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.580
I've said this numerous times, and you know what?

44
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.890
This person has the resume on one page.

45
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.230
That's a nice, easy one.

46
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.930
Good job.

47
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.640
What about the next one?

48
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.580
Include words from job description.

49
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.920
If I go into this resume, I don't know what this person was applying to.

50
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.010
But again, the very first items, which is what a recruiter is going to look at, is going to read.

51
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.280
I wish to obtain a web graphic design position where my unique technical and creative experience will

52
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.040
be valuable.

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.490
Having worked in media, I am familiar with a fast paced environment, keeping tight deadlines and maybe

54
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.800
some technical knowledge and work experience.

55
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.360
But just by reading this resume, I have no idea what this person is applying to.

56
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.250
I just see that while they're looking for a web graphic design position, but it's not very specific.

57
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.380
We want to include words from the actual job description.

58
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.180
If they're looking for a front end developer, make sure that the front end developer maybe JavaScript

59
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.740
is included in your objectives or technical knowledge right at the beginning.

60
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.470
Again, key words are those wars that people are going to see, recruiters are going to see or even

61
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.300
machines that are reading your resume are going to see and say, oh, this person is the type of candidate

62
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.050
that we want.

63
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.400
Let's look at the next one.

64
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.770
Include company name you're applying to.

65
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.020
This is so simple to do and right away puts you above most resumes.

66
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.690
You see over here that this person hasn't really included that.

67
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.040
Ideally, you've added into the objective or maybe summary or the title, the company name or something

68
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.140
specific to that company that you want to improve.

69
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.070
Maybe the company is looking for engineers who can improve their infrastructure.

70
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.860
Well, you should definitely have those words and that phrase in your objective.

71
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.000
All right.

72
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.170
Off to the next one.

73
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.010
Does your first item on your resume reflect what?

74
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.030
You are looking for or what they are looking for?

75
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.320
The company is looking for.

76
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.900
Again, this kind of goes hand in hand with the job description and the company name.

77
00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.150
But your technical knowledge, your objective, your experience should be exactly especially the very

78
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.700
first items should be exactly what they're looking for.

79
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.140
Again, if he don't include those words and you give them something random, like this person has a

80
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.660
company name here and a company link of somewhere that they've worked in the past.

81
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.610
Well, I don't really care.

82
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.030
And if I look over here, the first item that I see is HTML.

83
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.880
If they're applying for a web graphic design position.

84
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.610
Hmm.

85
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.910
HTML is probably not the most important here.

86
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.480
Item here.

87
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.890
So again.

88
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.740
Oops.

89
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.650
Again, I don't really care about that.

90
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.080
All right.

91
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.300
Off to the next point.

92
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.470
We're flying through this.

93
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.670
It's not that bad, is it?

94
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.030
Experience titles demonstrate value.

95
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.690
Probably the most poorly worded sentence I have come up with.

96
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.140
But let me explain what it means.

97
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.710
The experience title should demonstrate value.

98
00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:00.200
That is, the work experience, which is usually the main part of the resume, should show that you

99
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.160
provide value.

100
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.300
If I go into this person's resume, the first sentence I'm going to read is that a company's name that

101
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.920
they've worked at that I've never heard of WebMD, which is a big website, so I've heard of them.

102
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.780
And then I see web producer.

103
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.340
And then again, responsibility includes updating HTML content.

104
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.330
Doesn't really demonstrate a lot of value here.

105
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.860
Instead, you want to make sure that your work experience shows a value that is, instead of having

106
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.100
the company name here, unless it's a big company like Amazon, Netflix or Alibaba, something with

107
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.800
a lot of good recognition.

108
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.140
I don't really care about the company.

109
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.830
I care about what you did.

110
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.270
Web producer that sounds a lot more impressive than this company name, so this should be bolded and

111
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.990
highlighted.

112
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.410
Production Coder Again, more important than web and our director again more important.

113
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:02.850
So you want to make sure that that's highlighted that those are the key things that shows your valuable.

114
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.020
Another thing is if you look at the the sentence over here, this HTML part doesn't sound impressive,

115
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.710
but the second part, cropping retouching, optimizing photos for creation of thumbnails and other images.

116
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.460
I mean, you could reward that and make that sound better, such as improving performance of the website

117
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.300
by optimizing assets such as photos.

118
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:34.800
Having those first item demonstrate value is very, very important and this is actually over here as

119
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.100
well.

120
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.410
When we go to technical knowledge, we see that the second item is GMs office, Microsoft Office.

121
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.930
I mean, everybody knows how to use word.

122
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.340
It's not very impressive.

123
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.890
Maybe adding Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop Illustrator Flash at the beginning.

124
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.150
If you're applying for a web design, graphic position is more important than Microsoft Office.

125
00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:01.350
And again, even this sentence I've been hand coding HTML for nine years says for four years webmaster

126
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.270
done php mysql.

127
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.650
Why is that so small?

128
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.990
And underneath everything a recruiter is going to see this without reading this full sentence.

129
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.420
That's probably the most valuable part of the resume.

130
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.100
This should probably be up over here again making those key items.

131
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.980
Remember this image that I showed you, the very highlighted items, the most important thing.

132
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:23.880
All right.

133
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.650
I think I've talked about that point enough.

134
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.850
Let's go to the next one.

135
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.060
Do you have an online link?

136
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.909
Again, if you're applying to be a web graphic design designer and for people taking this course, you're

137
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.230
most likely some sort of an engineer.

138
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:45.120
You should have some sort of an online link to your GitHub profile, maybe blog posts, maybe website

139
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.630
portfolio that needs to be at the very top.

140
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.200
Next one, remove the word I.

141
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.610
I wish to obtain.

142
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.030
I am familiar.

143
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.890
I was hired.

144
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.350
I mean, all those sentences doesn't really tell me anything.

145
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.800
You're adding extra weight again.

146
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.700
You only have a few seconds to impress a recruiter and you're adding these extra items that we don't

147
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.840
really care about.

148
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:19.210
As a recruiter, we want to know right away what you can offer us, what type of asset you would be.

149
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.040
I have been.

150
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.410
We don't really care about that.

151
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:28.390
Instead, let's just say something like professional web graphic designer with five years of experience

152
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.190
gets to the point right away.

153
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.300
Again.

154
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.410
We don't care about.

155
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.800
I have been coding or any of those eyes.

156
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.450
Get to the point right away.

157
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.880
Speak in the third person if you want to.

158
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.280
Just make sure right away.

159
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.110
The first sentence that they read are the key words and important items on the list.

160
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.550
Let's look at the next one.

161
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.500
No buzzwords describing how gray you are.

162
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.220
And you know what?

163
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.610
This person definitely undersells themselves.

164
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.290
I think this resume could be a lot better.

165
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.680
This person definitely does not over inflate themselves.

166
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:07.290
But what I mean by buzzwords is don't put garbage on your resume.

167
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.850
That doesn't mean anything.

168
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:15.990
So words or phrases such as thought, leader, passionate entrepreneur, and sometimes people actually

169
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.420
think negatively on these type of terms.

170
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.800
Don't tell the recruiter him or her what to think about you.

171
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.810
And we want to focus on using something called action words.

172
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.730
And that's actually the next point.

173
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.410
Instead of using vague terms that don't really mean anything, we want action words.

174
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.620
What did you do and what were the results?

175
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.480
And you can be really creative here.

176
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.170
Every time you do something with code, see how you add it to your resume as an action and an end result.

177
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.120
It's very easy to just list your responsibilities kind of like this person has done.

178
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.330
But what did you actually do?

179
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.810
And I mean, this sentence is actually pretty impressive over here.

180
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.250
The content or not, this one over here.

181
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.880
Testing the content management system and seeing that migration to the new servers is running smoothly.

182
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.930
I mean, that sounds a lot more impressive than coding.

183
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.220
HTML Web pages, action words perhaps should be testing, deploying, and observing content management

184
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.380
systems to production servers.

185
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.930
Maybe add some monitoring there, but you want to show exactly what you did and then perhaps even say

186
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:34.490
what were the results that the customer experience improved or that more customers came to the website

187
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.920
because of this transition to production servers?

188
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.540
And again, this translates into the next point.

189
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.330
We want to measure everything in terms of impact.

190
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.220
Don't just describe your responsibilities.

191
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.600
We want to show off what we've actually done for a company like WebMD.

192
00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:00.010
Ideally you have some sort of numbers, such as by how much did you improve the website performance

193
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.710
by optimizing the photos and thumbnails?

194
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:11.480
How much did the traffic of WebMD improve because of this migration to new servers?

195
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.680
By having numbers, it's a lot more tangible.

196
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.210
As a recruiter, I can see the impact that you had on the business, because let's be honest here.

197
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:25.300
Companies hire people that are assets that improve the company and create more revenue for them.

198
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.010
So if you're able to demonstrate that in a past job that you've actually here are the numbers.

199
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.780
This is how I improve the company.

200
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.350
Well, then you for sure are going to be a good hire.

201
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:36.100
All right.

202
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.390
Let's talk about the next one.

203
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.470
We're almost done here.

204
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.670
Hang with me here.

205
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.380
I know résumé is not the funnest topic, but I promise you it's going to get better and better.

206
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.480
So technical knowledge skills should include what they are looking for.

207
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.200
Only show years if it is impressive.

208
00:12:54.030 --> 00:13:02.460
So over here, this person, when I say years, I'm saying, hey, if you worked at this company only

209
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.010
for a month or two months, well, that's not very impressive.

210
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:10.980
But if you have a certain number of years of experience, this person has nine years that they've been

211
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.240
coding on HTML, CSS for four years.

212
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.220
I mean, that's nine years of experience.

213
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.680
You don't even have to mention HTML or CSS.

214
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.740
You can just say that you're a web and graphic designer with nine years of experience.

215
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.750
I mean, that sounds impressive.

216
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.250
And you also want to make sure that these technical skills is what they're looking for.

217
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.630
I doubt they're looking for mass office or laptop PC hardware knowledge.

218
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:44.260
They're probably looking for Photoshop, Illustrator, maybe CSS, maybe PHP, MySQL.

219
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.310
Maybe it's a React position you're applying for.

220
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.860
You want to make sure that you show off those skills.

221
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.810
And if you have many years of experience with them, make sure you include that number.

222
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.350
If you don't have that many years of experience, just don't show the number.

223
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.030
You don't need to tell them everything.

224
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.720
All right.

225
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.860
Last two items.

226
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.960
Include only sections, items that are impressive experience projects, education, technical skills.

227
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.960
This just says hey, only include items that a recruiter really cares about.

228
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:25.280
For example, if I was an intern at a flower shop five years ago as a recruiter, maybe recruiting for

229
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.960
a software engineering role.

230
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.600
I don't really care about your flower experience.

231
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:35.000
I mean, hey, maybe some people do, but I doubt that they do only include things that are relevant

232
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.970
or can be indirectly.

233
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.220
Improve your odds of getting a job.

234
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:47.300
You don't want to just fill out a resume just to fill out a resume if it doesn't actually add to your

235
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.290
overall picture.

236
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.240
Now this person does a pretty good job.

237
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.630
You can see that most of their experiences, technical knowledge.

238
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.920
So that's good.

239
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.310
But we see over here that usually you want to include experience, maybe projects, education and technical

240
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.160
skills, anything outside of that.

241
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:09.120
I mean, you can add it, but only if you think it'll improve the way the recruiter sees you.

242
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.000
But those four categories should be enough.

243
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.730
And then finally, everybody knows this.

244
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.750
But I added it on here just in case no typos are bad grammar.

245
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:23.790
If you're not a native English speaker or a native speaker of your language, make sure you get somebody

246
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.060
to double check your resume that there's no typos.

247
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.710
But everybody knows that.

248
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.140
Whoo!

249
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.800
All right.

250
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.090
That was a lot.

251
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.230
I know, I know.

252
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:38.480
But, hey, I'm excited, just as you that we're almost we're pretty much done with the resume section

253
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.580
so we can get into the fun technical part.

254
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.530
But, you know, people have written books on the topic of how to write resumes.

255
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.060
And there's so many things, so many minor things that you can adjust to make them important.

256
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:55.970
But if you follow these steps and I'm going to give you the sheet right after this lesson, you've pretty

257
00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.230
much done 90% of the work that is important for you to get a job.

258
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.790
After that, you should be focusing on other things, such as improving your skills as a developer.

259
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.810
So by just following this simple list, I guarantee your percentage of getting interviews is going to

260
00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.560
increase, at least with resumes.

261
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.240
That's it.

262
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:21.180
Hopefully by looking at this and your own resume and looking at these checkpoints, you can see how

263
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.440
you can improve things.

264
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:30.600
It's all about wording and how you can get the recruiter to see the top parts about you, the good things

265
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.300
about you at the very beginning, so that it catches their eye and they say, Hmm, I'm going to keep

266
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.140
reading or I'm going to give this person an interview so I can find out more.

267
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.360
Now that's enough for resumes.

268
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:48.630
There are books written on the topic, but you have to remember that they're simply a way to get interviews

269
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.180
and as such, treat them that way.

270
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.010
Don't overcomplicate them.

271
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.690
But I hope you get the general goal here.

272
00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.830
Every word in a resume should convince the recruiter why they should hire you.

273
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.060
I'll see in the next video.

274
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:03.990
Bye bye.
