00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.370
Hey there.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.710
It's is my face, Andre.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.720
I'm usually sitting in front of a computer, not in front of a camera, which I'm not comfortable with.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.510
But this is the AMA video.

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:23.870
And while I want to just absolutely thank all of you, because we have officially hit 100,000 unique

6
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.080
students, which is insane.

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.500
Absolutely mind blowing.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.689
I did an AMA video when we hit 1000 students and I thought that was just extraordinary.

9
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.210
And to be at 100,000 now is absolutely incredible.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.310
I feel extremely lucky.

11
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.880
I feel extremely blessed.

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.710
And not to get too sappy here, but I'm very, very thankful for you watching this video right now because

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.390
I don't really do any marketing.

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.910
And it's it's all grown out of word of mouth.

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.920
So thank you for telling your friends, your family, your kids, whatever it is.

16
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.790
I am extremely thankful that I get to do what I do.

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.230
And it's all because of you.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.930
All right, so no more happiness.

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.930
Let's get to it.

20
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.770
I asked you on discord, some questions that you might have for me.

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.840
There were a lot of questions.

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.760
Unfortunately, I won't be able to answer all of them.

23
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.460
I don't want to make this into a boring one hour video.

24
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.750
So I've picked the ones that I thought had a lot of people interested in them.

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.040
And hopefully I can give you some some answers.

26
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.990
Keep in mind that you should form your own opinions and decisions based on these.

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.000
This is just one person's view.

28
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.760
My view it doesn't mean that I'm 100% correct.

29
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.880
If I thought that, then I would have a YouTube channel.

30
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.490
But take it with a grain of salt.

31
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.050
These are just my opinions.

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.530
I may be wrong, I may be right is just what has worked in my life doesn't necessarily mean that it

33
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.990
will work for you or the answers are right for you.

34
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.420
All right, let's see.

35
00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.050
First one here we have Nicola, who asked, what's the best way to get into machine learning and artificial

36
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.950
intelligence?

37
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.540
That's actually a question that kept coming up.

38
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.260
A lot of people are interested in machine learning, data science, anything related to A.I. because

39
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.650
it is extremely popular and a hot topic right now.

40
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.220
I actually have a course coming up on it that that tries to tackle that question, because machine learning

41
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.880
right now is a bit of a buzzword where it it solves all your business problems when in fact maybe it's

42
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.020
not necessarily so.

43
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.360
And I think there's developer interest to learn about machine learning, as well as business analysts

44
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.290
and business decision makers to use machine learning and data to improve their profits and their business.

45
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.440
So I didn't really give you an answer for that one, but it's one of those topics that I think in order

46
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.890
to learn about it, you should at least learn to code B, become a web developer force, or perhaps

47
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.770
have some understanding of business data, data analysis before you get into it.

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.700
All right.

49
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.520
Next next question is from N.K..

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
Talk about your life as a developer from start until now to learn from you.

51
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.770
Well, I think some of you know, from my previous M.A., I did not come from a computer science background.

52
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.760
I came from a business background.

53
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.090
I did also a minor in psychology and learned to code in my twenties.

54
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160
I'm 33 now, by the way.

55
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.030
Hopefully I don't look 33, but that's that's my age.

56
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.160
And yeah, I would break down the developer lifecycle into three phases.

57
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.700
So the first one is where you're just learning.

58
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.690
You're learning to code.

59
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.150
Everything is completely new.

60
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.350
You feel extremely overwhelmed.

61
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.070
Overwhelmed.

62
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.010
You don't know what to learn, what person to trust, what mentor to have, what course to take.

63
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.580
That's a really big challenge and getting to the point of understanding and being able to build something

64
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.220
from scratch yourself, I think that's the first phase.

65
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.970
The second phase was when when I was employed for the first time and the first couple of years working

66
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.990
as a developer where you feel the imposter syndrome, right?

67
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:15.250
Where you feel like you just don't know enough, or somehow they hired you by mistake and while everybody

68
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.079
else around you is smarter than you.

69
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.110
That phase really goes by.

70
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.140
The the one advice that I have for that phase is to honestly be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

71
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.320
That is, ask as many questions as you want.

72
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.910
Don't feel like by raising your hand and asking a question, it's going to make you feel it's going

73
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.160
to make others look at you like you're dumb or not good enough.

74
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.630
The more questions you ask, the better you'll have the answers.

75
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.520
And you'll find that the successful people through this phase are the people who ask a ton of questions

76
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.590
when they don't understand something.

77
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.960
They try to learn and try to grab as much experience as possible from those around you.

78
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.110
And then the third phase is when you start to become a little bit of a senior developer, when you start

79
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.430
to get confident in your abilities, you perhaps start to lead projects.

80
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.870
Perhaps other junior developers look up to you and ask you questions.

81
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:15.070
One of the biggest things with that phase of a developer is to not almost get a god complex where you

82
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.570
feel like your opinions are the right ones and everybody else's is absolutely wrong.

83
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.600
I've seen way too many really good developers get overconfident in themselves and have really strong

84
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.960
opinions where they don't take anything else into consideration.

85
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.060
I think through that phase, if you're able to understand that everything has pros and cons, everything

86
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.410
depends on the situation and that you're not, oh, I only use GraphQL.

87
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh, I only use TypeScript.

88
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.010
And dynamic languages are trash.

89
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:54.550
When you avoid those strong opinions to almost make yourself feel like you're smart, you're doing something

90
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.000
wrong there.

91
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.220
You want to be open to ideas, open to suggestions, and not forget to keep growing from that phase.

92
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.270
Because as you start to get more and more recognition, maybe you feel more confident.

93
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.270
It's very easy to think that you've reached the pinnacle and you need to stop learning.

94
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.330
This whole industry is all about learning and constantly evolving and what, you know, two years from

95
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.520
now, we'll probably be different than what you know now.

96
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.870
So those are the three phases, kind of the ones that I went through.

97
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.090
Obviously I'm teaching now, but for me, learning doesn't stop.

98
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.440
I'm constantly learning.

99
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.750
I'm constantly trying to improve myself both in teaching, but also as a developer.

100
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.440
And I hope that that is the case with you as well.

101
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.050
All right.

102
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.000
Next question.

103
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.600
Next question is from SG.

104
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.170
How many countries have you visited during the last year?

105
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.210
Any suggestions to travel while working remote?

106
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.830
So for some of you that don't know, I work completely remote.

107
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.400
I carry my.

108
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.660
I recorded recording equipment online and I set up my studio wherever I am in the world.

109
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:05.090
So my courses have been recorded in in Ecuador, in Nicaragua, Colombia, in Greece and Romania, pretty

110
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.770
much anywhere that I'm traveling.

111
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.110
I bring my recording equipment, set up my little studio and and record.

112
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.180
So last year I traveled to, I would say, about seven or eight countries where I lived.

113
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.720
And then in them long term, my favorite was I actually recorded the master of the coding interview

114
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:32.090
course in a little house on the side of a volcano in Ecuador, where the last house at the very top

115
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.890
of the volcano.

116
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:41.120
So we had to hike down and grab groceries every time we needed to eat or wanted to cook dinner and hike

117
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.830
back up with all our groceries.

118
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.000
That was a lot of fun.

119
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.560
Any advice for remote?

120
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.560
Honestly, it's one of those lifestyles that it sounds nice, but it also requires a lot of dedication

121
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:58.850
and and commitment to to work instead of just not being committed to a schedule and making it really

122
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.870
easy to go off and pretend like you're busy without actually accomplishing anything.

123
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.940
So you do need to have a bit of structure.

124
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:13.700
But for those that are self motivated and determined enough and can keep track of tasks and don't get

125
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.360
distracted often, it's it's definitely a lot of fun.

126
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.750
All right.

127
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:26.810
This next question I think I got asked maybe five times from people like Dorian, Super Scramble Locke,

128
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.070
all of them essentially said, why did you quit your full time job?

129
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.650
How come you're not a developer anymore?

130
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.929
Well, let's say that I'm still a developer.

131
00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.780
I do a bit of consulting work on the side.

132
00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:43.850
The reason that I quit my developer job was mainly because I wanted to.

133
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.950
I wanted to travel a bit and take a break.

134
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:52.100
I had spent a couple of years working for other people and working on projects that perhaps I didn't

135
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.330
care too much about.

136
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.960
I was working for other people's passion projects or businesses, and after a while that that kind of

137
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.530
gets old.

138
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.250
Or at least it did for me where I found that I stopped learning as much.

139
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.130
It was just repeating and doing the same thing over and over.

140
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.230
So I decided to quit and kind of figure out what what I want to do next.

141
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:18.920
And along the way I decided to record some videos, my first course to Mastery, to just keep myself

142
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:27.510
busy and keep doing something and, and, and help people who were like me where they didn't have a

143
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.900
CSS background and wanted to get into web development, but there wasn't a clear path for them to do

144
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.320
so.

145
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:41.810
So I recorded that course and it took off and all of a sudden this became my full time job, and now

146
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.290
I would 100% still go back to being a full time developer.

147
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.720
But I'm having so much fun teaching.

148
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.100
I still get to code every day, I still get to learn every day.

149
00:09:52.100 --> 00:10:00.380
And if anything, I think this way I have a bigger impact on on people's lives than I did when I worked

150
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.700
on a single project.

151
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.980
So that's why I quit my job.

152
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.520
And at the end of the day, it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

153
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.030
I have another question here, which is what is my biggest regret?

154
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.310
I feel like I'm going to interview right now, so I'll give you my interview answer in case you ever

155
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.780
get asked this in an interview.

156
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:25.190
So my biggest regret, honestly, there's nothing I I'm really, really happy that I learned coding

157
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.110
when I did in my twenties and not when I was young, because when I was young, I was able to learn

158
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.800
different skills.

159
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.970
I was able to learn about business, about about psychology, about communicating with others and people.

160
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:44.150
And those skills helped me get my first job as a developer, although maybe I started to code when I

161
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.100
was a lot later on in life.

162
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.740
It's not like I didn't do anything before my twenties.

163
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.270
I was learning different skills.

164
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.680
And for those people that perhaps are thinking, Am I too old to learn to code?

165
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.420
Or I'm in my thirties and there's people, you know in their teens that are learning to code right now.

166
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.410
There's no way that I'm going to be able to keep up.

167
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.380
Keep in mind that most likely you have skill sets that other people don't.

168
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.280
And when it comes to regret, honestly, there's nothing.

169
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.470
As long as you're learning every single day and learning something useful over the years, that's going

170
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.610
to compound.

171
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:22.670
And honestly, every single mistake, every single decision that you make leads you to to where you

172
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:30.710
are now, which a little it sounds a little hokey pokey, but but it is true, honestly, the there

173
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.310
are no regrets if you're learning, you're you're never going to have regrets in life.

174
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.240
All right.

175
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:35.930
Yes.

176
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.350
How's it going?

177
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.850
Yaks asked me.

178
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.910
What annoyed you the most about being a developer.

179
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.700
I usually don't get annoyed.

180
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:51.020
I'm pretty easygoing, but the one thing that I did notice was that as people get more.

181
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.980
More and more experienced.

182
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.770
They tend to form really strong opinions and everybody wants to feel like they're part of a group.

183
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:03.890
And I think we see that a lot on Twitter and YouTube and all these people really strong opinions that

184
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.850
kind of gang up on other people that have different beliefs in them.

185
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:13.400
I think it's very easy in the developer community to have something like that where you're thinking,

186
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.400
my React team is better than your Angular team or TypeScript and static typing is the way to go.

187
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.550
Our rest is dead and let's all use GraphQL.

188
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.880
I think when you have that type of mentality, it's it's really, really hard to actually have smart

189
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.810
discussions and and and decisions within a project.

190
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:40.490
It becomes really, really easy for those who feel superior to others and feel confident in their opinions

191
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:48.500
to really impose their opinions on others, especially junior developers that are susceptible and have

192
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.430
less experience.

193
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.410
So they start to believe these senior developers that perhaps have really strong opinions.

194
00:12:54.410 --> 00:13:00.380
And in turn that kind of creates this wave of more and more people that think it's a good idea to have

195
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:06.650
strong opinions and debate with others and argue with others and and telling people that their code

196
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.080
sucks and their code is the right way of doing it.

197
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:19.520
I think that was a little bit annoying to deal with because because I think it influences junior developers

198
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.540
a lot and I don't think it's a good attitude to have when working with others.

199
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:31.190
I think being being somebody senior, being a lead, being a project lead, it means you're a person

200
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.700
that doesn't put other people down, but it lifts others.

201
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.250
And that was a little bit annoying because I thought that I saw that that was a little bit prevalent

202
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:46.580
where everybody's trying to almost outbid each other and be a better developer than the this person

203
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.680
and this person instead of all of you growing together and learning together because there's enough

204
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.150
developer jobs for everybody, you don't need to beat out everybody to be the number one developer.

205
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.370
So that mentality was was a little bit annoying to me.

206
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:07.160
But then again, I worked in Toronto and Silicon Valley and I think those areas especially have have

207
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.990
really, really strong individualistic philosophies.

208
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.280
All right.

209
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.110
This is another question from D.H. from where and how did you learn and become a developer?

210
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:24.080
So when I started to learn to be a developer, I probably spent, I would say, $20.

211
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:31.310
I think I bought a book on HTML and CSS and the rest was all online for free, just using online resources.

212
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.830
The only difference was that when I started to learn there were very few resources online.

213
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:44.870
I think I used one blog post that that told me to use Photoshop and -- and and some tools that I actually

214
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.890
didn't even need.

215
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:50.240
But it was really hard to find resources online when I started to learn.

216
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:58.970
So I essentially just try to grab as many resources as possible and create my own curriculum, but it's

217
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.750
not like it is now.

218
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.140
I think right now we have a lot of resources online.

219
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.390
It's a lot easier and there's there's more of a clear cut path to become a web developer.

220
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:14.060
So I'm a little bit jealous, but I also did the same thing that you probably are doing, which is watch

221
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:21.110
a lot of online courses, read a lot of books, read a lot of articles, and most importantly, building

222
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.880
my own projects and coding as much as possible that nothing beats actually coding.

223
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.620
You can watch videos all day, but if you're not doing anything, if you're not producing anything,

224
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.420
that's not it's like watching a tennis match and trying to become a better tennis player.

225
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.500
It's just not going to happen.

226
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.100
We have Jamie who asks, What's the best way to practice code?

227
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.910
Is it good for is it good by imitating someone else?

228
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.870
Code for practicing again goes back to my last point.

229
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.420
The best way to practice code is to code.

230
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.750
The the more you code, the more you practice, the better it is.

231
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:59.150
But keep in mind that the best way to code is to solve your own problems, create your own projects.

232
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:05.870
I actually don't recommend just watching all my videos and following along without coding because then

233
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.380
you're not going to be able to do things on your own.

234
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.890
The best way to code is to code by by doing your own thing.

235
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.860
You can watch 100 videos on people coding and follow along, but if you don't understand why we're doing

236
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:28.370
things, then when you're left to your own device, you're not going to be able to do anything.

237
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.580
So the best way to code is think of a project today.

238
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:37.940
Think of a task that you have to do over and over in your life and see if you can automate it with code.

239
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.520
That's the best way to to learn Thai.

240
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.940
LIM What ask what is your favorite tech stack?

241
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.710
My favorite test tech stack is the one that lets me accomplish my goal as fast as possible.

242
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.720
That's a very vague.

243
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.380
Answer.

244
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:59.110
But honestly, anything that lets me finish fast and deliver something fast is my favorite text stack

245
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.430
because I tend to work by myself or in small teams.

246
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.930
I really prefer things that are efficient.

247
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:13.470
So for example, I'm not a big fan of TypeScript because although you get type safety and static typing,

248
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.970
it's a lot of extra code.

249
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.170
It's the same reason that I personally am not a big fan of Java programming.

250
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:25.050
Not because it's not a great language, but because for my personal use cases, I'm now working at a

251
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:30.210
big company with thousands of developers for, let's say, a financial institution.

252
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:36.750
If I'm building a personal project, I'd rather use something quick and easy, like Python or JavaScript,

253
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.230
to write a few lines of code and accomplish a goal.

254
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.710
So there's really no favorite tech stack.

255
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.410
It's the stack that allows me to accomplish the goal the fastest, which happens to be usually dynamically

256
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.160
typed languages, and usually the languages that I'm comfortable with.

257
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.750
I don't need to learn something new until I have a need to to learn something new.

258
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.320
All right.

259
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.790
Small rules.

260
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.130
Junior, s morales.

261
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:02.550
Junior.

262
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.300
That's what it is.

263
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.200
Any advice on escaping the golden handcuffs and going freelance?

264
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.870
I have a cushy non developer job at Google and it's hard to imagine leaving when a family and a mortgage,

265
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.180
but I long for freedom.

266
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:21.480
And this this topic of freelancer is another topic that has come up many, many times.

267
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.830
So let me address it right now.

268
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.230
I get to work remotely.

269
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:36.030
I get to work for myself, which I feel very fortunate, fortunate about, and I'm extremely lucky.

270
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.160
But when it comes to freelancing, I actually am against freelancing.

271
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.860
Obviously, every situation is different.

272
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:49.200
But let me explain why I think freelancing might not be the best option for most of you, not all of

273
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.340
you, but for most of you.

274
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.500
You see, when it comes to freelancing, let's say you're just starting to learn.

275
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.120
You're just learning to code.

276
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.400
If you go straight into freelancing, you lose the ability to work with others, to learn from others,

277
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.920
and actually be in a company and understand how their processes work, how they work with developers.

278
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.440
You gain a lot of experience by working on projects with others, with other developers, working with

279
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.900
management teams, working with with project managers, Scrum Masters.

280
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.450
That's a really, really valuable experience that I really recommend for people just getting into coding.

281
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.950
Now let's say that you've had a couple of years of experience, you've worked with teams, you have

282
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.850
that experience.

283
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.620
Should you go into freelancing?

284
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.630
I think you should go into freelancing.

285
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.670
If you have a clear edge or a clear advantage over others.

286
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:45.000
For example, you have an existing client base and you have people that really trust your work or you

287
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.340
offer a really unique skill.

288
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:54.870
The problem with freelancing right now is that you're essentially battling with thousands, potentially

289
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.470
millions of other freelancers to get a job.

290
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.650
A lot of people might go to places like Upwork or any type of place where you can bid on projects.

291
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.940
What happens is in those scenarios, people just.

292
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.880
Bid, and it's a battle to lower and lower prices.

293
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.690
So what happens?

294
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:21.940
You eventually become an employee of a contract that you probably didn't charge enough for.

295
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:28.550
So it's really hard for you to compete with people that keep lowering and lowering and lowering prices.

296
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.290
And you'll see that if you're a freelancer, that's what will happen unless you have an established

297
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:38.180
client base, unless you have a really distinct advantage.

298
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.730
Maybe you're extremely skilled in graphic design and you're well known, then yes, maybe you can charge

299
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:44.270
more for it.

300
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:50.450
But people that are usually looking for freelancers are usually looking for the cheapest price.

301
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.720
And when you do that, you stop valuing your time.

302
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.460
You stop being a slave to the person that created the contract.

303
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:06.260
And you're trying to fulfill somebody you're trying to fulfill and please this person so that they give

304
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.630
you a good review for the next contract job.

305
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:16.610
I think freelancer jobs are can be good, but there's also a lot of issues that come with it.

306
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:23.300
If you want to be a freelancer or perhaps be your own boss, I think there's better ways for you to

307
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.140
to go about it.

308
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:30.620
I think there's smarter ways to go about it instead of competing with others on price.

309
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.750
So I know that's not really helpful.

310
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.220
It's just my personal opinion when it comes to freelancing, but it is a question that I get asked a

311
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.640
lot.

312
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:44.510
Freelancing essentially involves you taking a lot of time finding clients, working a lot for clients.

313
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.430
And at the end of the day, why not just work for a company that already has the clients for you so

314
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.990
you can gain that experience?

315
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:57.530
You might think you have the freedom of being a freelancer or being your own job, but instead you're

316
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.060
you are an employee of whoever your contractor is.

317
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.840
That's my advice.

318
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.870
I know it's not it's not very, very helpful.

319
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.550
But like I said, it's not for everybody.

320
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.180
I think there's there's better opportunities for you to work remotely.

321
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.800
You can work for remote companies.

322
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.870
There's tons of websites right now of showing companies that hire remote workers.

323
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:26.750
I think that's a better option for you than being a freelancer because the reasons that I mentioned

324
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:34.940
previously jtv is eight ask how is life as far as time spent with family and doing what you like now

325
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:40.730
as an instructor and before when you work for a company, do do you enjoy work more now or before when

326
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.870
you work for a company?

327
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.370
Hands down.

328
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.920
I absolutely love what I'm doing now.

329
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.350
I wake up every day and all I can think about is, is work and what I'm going to teach or what video

330
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.680
I'm going to record or what coding challenge I'm going to do.

331
00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.850
I am I feel so extremely lucky to be at a point in my life where I absolutely adore and love what I'm

332
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.420
doing.

333
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.470
And I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

334
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.310
Being a developer was absolutely great, working full time for a company.

335
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.250
I loved it, you know?

336
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.530
I had a lot of friends.

337
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:18.560
I got along really well with with my bosses, with my clients.

338
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:26.780
But having having the freedom to to work on what I want to work on my projects, but most importantly,

339
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:34.160
knowing that the work that I do maybe impacts just a little bit a little bit of of the world, I think

340
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.290
is a really rewarding feeling.

341
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:41.870
And I'm extremely thankful to to know that, you know, not everybody's going to love my courses, but

342
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:48.200
at least there are some that do enjoy my courses and gain a bit of help in their career through it.

343
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.360
And that is the most rewarding feeling.

344
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.360
And honestly, the past two years since I've started to teach have been some of the happiest moments

345
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.440
of of my life.

346
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.400
And I know this thing isn't going to last forever.

347
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:07.160
I know I'm not going to teach forever, but I'm really appreciative of this moment to have this opportunity,

348
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.950
at least for now.

349
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:15.320
All right, Mr. Lucifer's asks a safe, secure and stable life being a skillful employee, working for

350
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:21.440
someone else, or dreaming big and starting a business on your own and being your own boss, what path

351
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.430
do you suggest?

352
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.440
Honestly, it really depends.

353
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.950
I think everybody wants the ideal work for yourself, own your own business, work remotely, live wherever

354
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.400
you want.

355
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.210
It sounds sexy, but it's it's not for everybody.

356
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:41.510
And, you know, I before I started teaching, before I was a developer, I started a bunch of businesses.

357
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.230
I was running, surfing, yoga retreats in Nicaragua.

358
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.630
I was doing adventure tours.

359
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.090
I was doing adventurous businesses.

360
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:55.550
I was trying all these different things that in the end weren't extremely successful.

361
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.990
But there are a lot of fun.

362
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:02.210
And meanwhile, I had friends who were doing their MBAs, they were becoming lawyers.

363
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.980
And, you know, they have really nice life right now.

364
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.260
They have they have families.

365
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:09.380
They're.

366
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.290
Very comfortable.

367
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:16.380
And there's actually there's actually an advantage there as as you start to work at a company and you

368
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.730
see people leave that company, most people think, oh, I should I should leave, too.

369
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.940
But you can also look at it as an opportunity for somebody else has left.

370
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:32.760
Now you are one step closer to going up at that corporate or company ladder.

371
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.170
So I think it's not it's not one is better than the other.

372
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.940
It really depends on why you prefer what kind of lifestyle you prefer.

373
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.530
Do you want more of a stable, comfortable life to make sure that you can provide for your family?

374
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:51.720
Or are you at a stage in your life where you can perhaps take more risks and you're okay with the highs

375
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.240
ups and high, high downs, high ups and high downs that may pay off.

376
00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:03.120
Maybe not in the end, but I think every day if you're working towards what your ideal life should look

377
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.010
like, eventually you will get there.

378
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.020
But don't expect to get there overnight.

379
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.730
You know, it's it's hard work.

380
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.600
Nothing comes easy.

381
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.220
There's no easy solution.

382
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:16.380
So all you can do is kind of work towards that goal and learn every day and improve every day.

383
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.270
And eventually you'll get there.

384
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.090
But it really matters.

385
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.100
It's the best thing you can do is to have a plan for yourself and write down what you value.

386
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:32.130
And based on those values and what makes you happy, decide what type of path you want to take.

387
00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.710
I got all philosophical there for you.

388
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.720
All right, let's get back to some coding.

389
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.300
Justin w Lynn.

390
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:45.540
Hey, Justin asks, how do you decide to learn next in this ever changing landscape from Redux?

391
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.770
GraphQL React Angular View SSR There's so much to learn, so little time.

392
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.000
So I guess how do you decide what to learn then and how you actually learn and make time for it?

393
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.010
I think this is actually something I I'm pretty good at or I think I'm good at, and that is because

394
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:07.830
when I started to learn how to code, I realized how much is out there I've become I've become really

395
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.770
good at selecting only the right things to learn.

396
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:17.460
And there's the famous Pareto Principle, which says the 20% usually accounts for 80% of value.

397
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:23.130
So what's the 20% that's going to give you 80% of of value when learning?

398
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.110
And, you know, things like GraphQL, for example, they're extremely popular.

399
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.970
So a lot of people want to learn it.

400
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.920
But at the end of the day, how many how many people actually use GraphQL in production?

401
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.540
How many people have actually built something with GraphQL that creates a value?

402
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:47.070
I like to look at technologies and see see what's what's hot and what's trending, but not necessarily

403
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.780
jump really deep into them until there's a clear need for me to learn it.

404
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.950
So for example.

405
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:58.530
Vue.js Yeah, I know a bit of Vue.js, but I wouldn't call myself an expert because I haven't had to

406
00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.970
use Vue.

407
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.270
I can use React or I can use Angular.

408
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:09.450
So being selective in what you learn instead of trying to learn everything is going to be a better long

409
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:18.570
term strategy over the course of your career because learning never stops and the more you learn, the

410
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:24.570
more you start to realize that it's not about the syntax, it's not about learning the libraries, it's

411
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.960
not about reading the documentation from start to finish.

412
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.510
It's about understanding the higher principles.

413
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.060
The Why was this tool built?

414
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.040
Why are we doing things the way it is?

415
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.510
What problem is it solving?

416
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:43.260
Being able to understand those and discuss those is going to be really, really important because at

417
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.790
the end of the day, the fundamentals is is what matters, not the syntax.

418
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:53.670
If you learn the fundamentals, if you learn to think like a developer, think about systems and how

419
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:59.550
things communicate, that's a lot more valuable than learning the newest React API.

420
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:07.590
I mean, that could still be important, but but as you can see, I'm very selective in what I learn

421
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:12.630
and I'm not I'm not trying to learn ten languages at the same time.

422
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:17.070
If I want to learn something, I'll dedicate maybe a year to get really, really good at something and

423
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.480
then move on to the next thing.

424
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:26.190
So really being picky as if you're dating a new technology and making sure that it's the right one is

425
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.940
the way to go.

426
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:32.010
Oh, and with that said, you obviously have to enjoy what you're doing.

427
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.070
If you don't enjoy learning, then that's going to be really hard.

428
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:41.640
So that's just something that has to come for yourself and being able to enjoy the learning process

429
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.830
because that's that's going to be your biggest asset.

430
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.660
If you enjoy learning, you're going to learn more.

431
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:50.550
Adrian asks How long do you plan on continuing doing courses?

432
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.760
Because well, this isn't going to last forever, right?

433
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.620
Honestly, I'm not sure I'm.

434
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.700
It's been close to two years now that I've been doing this.

435
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.170
I don't imagine doing this for.

436
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.890
For a lifetime.

437
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.020
There's only so much I could teach.

438
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.800
I'm going to keep going until I stop enjoying it.

439
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.480
Right now, I really enjoy the process.

440
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:18.350
I get a lot of reward by by hearing your your reviews and how pleased you are with the courses.

441
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.820
So that really drives me to create more, but eventually I will have to stop.

442
00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.800
I can't just keep creating courses.

443
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.140
They they do take a lot of time and effort.

444
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.550
So I hope that I can keep going for for a few more years.

445
00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:39.290
But one day maybe retire and and spend a little more time with family or move on to something else.

446
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.120
But for now, don't worry.

447
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.170
I'm not going anywhere.

448
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.560
Balloon asks, Do you play any instruments?

449
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.950
No.

450
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:51.470
I am the least musically talented, artistically talented person you'll ever beat.

451
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.560
I took piano lessons, guitar lessons when I was a kid.

452
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.760
And I'm.

453
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.810
I'm hopeless.

454
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.630
Thank God coding exists and thank God sports exist.

455
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:06.740
Because if if I had to do anything in the arts, I would be I would not be very good, Garrison asks.

456
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.590
It would be really inspirational for all of us who are.

457
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.460
What do you want to do with the next ten years of your life?

458
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.210
Coding business looks like he is the same age as me.

459
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.380
So just asking what's what's the next ten years of my life look like?

460
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:26.720
The next ten years of my life is going to evolve learning every day I want to, whether it's coding,

461
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.280
whether it's different things.

462
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.160
I'll have different hobbies that I want to keep improving, that I really like surfing.

463
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.870
So I want to become a better surfer.

464
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.450
And there's so many things that I really want to improve.

465
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.230
So honestly, every single day my goal is to learn.

466
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.240
I want to hopefully have a family by then and have a house and and just enjoy life.

467
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:55.580
And hopefully in ten years I'm retired, being able to being able to spend every single day with my

468
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.700
son or daughter and just enjoying life.

469
00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.130
But honestly, what I'm doing now is not much different than what I hope to be doing ten years from

470
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.900
now because I am really, really happy with with how life is right now.

471
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.300
And I wouldn't really change anything.

472
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:16.700
Dorian again asks, Do you think all the races you do and yoga and exercises help you mental clarity

473
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.600
and have helped your career as a developer when things get rough?

474
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.760
Yeah, so fun fact.

475
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.540
I'm also a yoga instructor on the side and I do.

476
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.640
I do a lot of adventure racing as well.

477
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.450
And both of those things I think actually really help with being a developer and dealing with different

478
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.620
situations at work.

479
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:42.110
I think for adventure racing, it it puts you into situations that are extremely uncomfortable that

480
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.750
you have to just survive through.

481
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:50.510
And then with yoga, obviously it stills your mind, especially with meditation as well.

482
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.730
I think those are extremely important, especially when compared to coding, when you're staring at

483
00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:02.060
the screen and everything is usually fast paced and it's really, really easy to get lost in your head.

484
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:08.090
I think balancing out coding with something that's complete opposite, like yoga or meditation, again,

485
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:17.450
not to get a little hippy here, but you know, I think doing different things is is important and being

486
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:24.230
physically active, being mentally strong is this is your vessel and this is your body and you should

487
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.920
take care of it.

488
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.610
And it will only improve you as a developer and as a coder.

489
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:34.580
So by 100% think that, you know, although for some people it may be silly to meditate, although for

490
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.700
some people they don't enjoy exercising.

491
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.260
Everybody has their different things.

492
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:44.420
But I think doing something other than coding is really, really important for that balance.

493
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:51.050
And to not burn yourself, burn yourself out a sim, a med, ask about an interview and the fact that

494
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:55.070
he's really worried about interviews and that he doesn't know enough.

495
00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:00.740
And honestly, just keep this in mind because because this is something I hear from so many people.

496
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.920
Everybody is just a child trapped in an adult's body.

497
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.920
No human knows everything perfectly.

498
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.650
And most likely the person sitting across from you that's asking you a question on a on an interview,

499
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:22.940
doesn't know everything, has their own insecurities, has their own areas that they're not an expert

500
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.090
in.

501
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:30.739
So going to an interview knowing that this person is not God, it's not the ultimate smartest person

502
00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:31.580
that you'll ever meet.

503
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.530
They have their flaws and their issues.

504
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:39.440
And if you start to realize that there's no such thing as a perfect developer, a perfect code, and

505
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.429
everybody is just trying to pretend like they're smart.

506
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.560
Everybody's just trying to pretend like they're an adult.

507
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.520
Remember, everybody's just a kid inside a trapped inside an adult's body.

508
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.280
You start to realize that this whole.

509
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:58.350
Whole world that we live in, this whole system that we're in is just a game, just like your coder,

510
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.780
just like you're a programmer and you're trying to create a system.

511
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:10.450
This is simply a system that you need to learn to adapt to and to try to essentially beat or improve.

512
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.210
So put yourself in their situation.

513
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.010
They want to feel important.

514
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.740
They want to feel like they're doing a good job.

515
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:23.830
So maybe asking them questions during the interview, maybe praising them for something that they did,

516
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.370
even though they're the ones being interviewed, is going to make them feel better.

517
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:31.800
That perhaps will make them ask you better or easier questions.

518
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.000
Again, think of it as a system.

519
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.590
Think of it as a game and realize that there is nothing.

520
00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.380
Nothing is extremely serious and important.

521
00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.680
Everything is just a game that you can play and that you can improve.

522
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:51.640
And if you start looking at life interviews as a as a game, I think it becomes a lot more fun and it

523
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.550
also remove some of those insecurities.

524
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.750
I don't know if that answer helped, but kind of went on a tangent there, but hopefully that that helps

525
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.350
a little bit.

526
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.130
All right.

527
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.100
Last question, because this video is getting a little too long.

528
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:08.560
So Charles Manson asks, what's a difficult day for you at the moment?

529
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:15.910
Your courses are very oh, that's very kind of you seem to be your healthy way of living in your sporty

530
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.360
attitude.

531
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:22.660
It all must be worth a course on how to balance your life and the way you do things while you code.

532
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:30.100
I guess I kind of already talked about this, but my my everyday life usually involves in the morning

533
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:37.120
drinking coffee, reading articles and catching up in the industry, learning a little bit.

534
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:44.980
I really like Morning for Learning and then I usually either record or plan recording or edit videos

535
00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.060
in the afternoon.

536
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:52.270
Then around one 2:00, I usually go out for a run, do some exercises, try to get outside and stare

537
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.790
at a screen and and be active.

538
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.170
And then I come back.

539
00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:02.980
I usually check out my emails, answer questions, go on discord and chat with other students.

540
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.680
And then usually by 5:00, I'm done.

541
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.180
I don't do any work.

542
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.800
I stop whatever I'm doing because I know after 5:00, for me personally, I'm not productive.

543
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:19.720
So I usually spend time with family, with my girlfriend or do social activities, or maybe go play

544
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.760
some tennis, go play some soccer, go for a hike just to relax.

545
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.500
And I usually go to bed at 10:00.

546
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.670
Not that very exciting.

547
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.850
I don't I don't enjoy going to bars or clubs anymore.

548
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.410
I'm I'm an old soul.

549
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.160
And at 10:00, I'm ready for bed and I'm ready for the next day.

550
00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.740
So a pretty, pretty boring day.

551
00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.000
Nothing too exciting.

552
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.030
But it's it's it's what I like.

553
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.220
All right, anyway, this this was the AMA video.

554
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.690
Again, I want to thank you.

555
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:54.820
I cannot believe that there's 100,000 students that are taking my courses.

556
00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:00.690
And honestly, if it was just me, I would never get to 100,000 students.

557
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:07.330
It's it's every single one of you that talk to others recommend my courses that really helped me get

558
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.110
to where I am.

559
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:16.030
And I cannot express how thankful I am for for everything that that you have done, that you have shown

560
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.750
support for.

561
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:23.500
And I'm I hope to continue to keep impressing you and keep helping you with with your learning journey.

562
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.460
And yeah, I'm I'm really, really thankful.

563
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.710
So thank you.
