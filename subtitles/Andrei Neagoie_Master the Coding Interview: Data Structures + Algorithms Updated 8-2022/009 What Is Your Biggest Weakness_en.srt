1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,110
All right, we're on a roll here, so let's just keep going through a few more questions here.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,990
What is your biggest weakness?

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,490
How would you answer this?

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,390
Well, here's the thing with these questions.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,240
You better not give something silly like I work too hard.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,090
Or My biggest weakness is that I care too much about my coworkers.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,740
First of all, people can really see through that and label you as fake or a liar.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,130
But again, every question should be something that makes you stand out, that makes the interviewer

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,080
say, Wow, I want to work with this person.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,220
So how can we twist this around to something that the interviewer is going to say?

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,400
Yep, this person should be hired for this company.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,530
It's very simple here.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,880
One is you need a real answer.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,390
Again, no silly answers of how gray you are.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,560
Be honest.

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,460
Say something that you have as a real weakness.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,910
But the key is you have to show how you overcame it, how you improved it.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,480
So don't say.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,410
I'm too passionate.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,050
Maybe say something along the lines of Sometimes when there's a problem, I get straight into coding

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,140
without really thinking about the problem.

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,810
And as I'm typing, as I'm typing, I realize that perhaps I should have waited, planned out how I

23
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,880
should write my code, how it should be structured, what problem am I really solving before I start

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,810
just coding it?

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,810
So lately I've taken the time to make sure that I write pseudocode first.

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,360
Just commenting out the steps that I want to take.

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:47,110
While my assumptions are what my inputs are and from there, write out the steps that I want my code

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,210
to take before I actually dive into code.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,620
You see what I did there?

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,070
I talked about my weakness, but somehow I turned it around.

31
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,190
Do something that makes me a great candidate.

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:05,230
Somebody that has improved from their past mistakes and now is working in a way that's ideal for a developer.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,800
That's it.

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,009
There's not much to say here.

35
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:14,640
Just be honest, but use this question as a way to again show how you're better than the rest, how

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
you're a great candidate.

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,430
I'll see you in the next one.
