1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,420
Congratulations.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,240
You just received an offer from a company.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,520
You should be proud of yourself.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,890
Pat yourself on the back.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,260
Take a couple of breaths.

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,380
And now let's talk about what you should do next.

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,720
You just received an offer.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,010
What is your response going to be if you say, Yep, this sounds great, let's do it.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:29,600
You just ended the conversation, you just accepted and you've closed the door on any sort of negotiation.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,760
That's it.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,450
As a recruiter or an interviewer, their job is done.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,000
They hired you?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,000
But is there a better way?

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,900
Remember, we don't want to end the conversation here.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,230
Instead, you might want to say something along the lines of this.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,210
This sounds fantastic.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,830
I really thought this was a great fit when I met you and I interviewed you.

18
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,160
And I'm really glad to see that we both agree.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,560
And you see a good fit here.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,750
Right now I'm talking to a few other companies, so I can't really speak to the full details of the

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,870
offer until I'm done with the interviewing process and I'm closer to making a decision.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,900
But I'm sure that we can find something that works great for us because I would really love to be part

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,610
of your team and I had a great time interviewing and I could really see myself working there long term.

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,700
You see what I did there?

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:33,350
I kept the conversation going and I let them know that I'm interviewing at other companies, but I didn't

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,370
seem very greedy.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,880
I instead said that I would love to work from them, but I want to make sure that I make the right decision

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,950
based on the offers that I get.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,420
Remember, I was very positive.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,930
You want to be positive when handling an offer.

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,530
You don't want to seem greedy or that you're just shopping around.

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:02:00,210
And ideally when you receive an offer, the first thing that you should try and do is to ask for more

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,160
time to make your decision.

34
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,860
Especially if this is your first offer, because ideally you're not just interviewing one company,

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,060
you're interviewing at multiple companies.

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,120
And ideally, if you're well prepared, like you have been in this course, then you're going to have

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,860
a few more offers coming in.

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,910
So time is the most valuable thing you can ask for here.

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,790
The more time you have, the more time you have to have offers from different companies so you can make

40
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,610
the right decision and pick the one or the company that has the best package for you.

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,020
Now, you just received an offer.

42
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,010
You just told them that you're very excited and you're waiting around for a few more things.

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:52,150
And you also ask for time and you have an idea of when they want to give you a response, the next thing

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,270
you want to do is after you receive the offer to let the other companies know.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,620
Again, if you're already interviewing at other companies, you now have a very powerful tool.

46
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,880
You have stakes.

47
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,190
You should be reaching out to all these companies that you haven't received an offer from to let them

48
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,500
know that you've just received an offer.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,580
And you want to build a sense of urgency here as if you have a timeline, a deadline where you have

50
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,520
to say yes or no to an offer.

51
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,920
So you would like to hear from these other companies as well.

52
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,490
And this is a classic psychological technique.

53
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,240
Remember, you're right now in the best part of interviewing where the ball is in your court and you

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,790
get to decide what company you want to work for.

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,650
So you can actually send out an email like this to the other companies.

56
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,450
Hello.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,290
Name of company or person?

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,610
I just wanted to let you know and give you an update on my interviewing process.

59
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,020
I've just received an offer from another company.

60
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,570
You can give the company name, which is quite strong.

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,560
With that said, I'm really excited to potentially be working with your company.

62
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:11,650
I had a really good time interviewing with you and I really want to see if we can make things work.

63
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:18,790
Since my timeline is now a little bit compressed with this new offer, is there anything we can do to

64
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,100
make the process go a little bit faster?

65
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,750
And that's it.

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,160
You've just let the other companies know that there's another offer.

67
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,130
The other companies know that you're wanted and you're needed somewhere else.

68
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,720
This creates a lot of social proof and also creates urgency to psychological techniques that really,

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,310
really help and negotiation.

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,680
You now have stakes.

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,980
You have to realize what a company's goals are.

72
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,640
A company's goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than

73
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,260
the salary that they're paying them.

74
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,080
What's going to cost to hire you?

75
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,690
Companies try their best to figure out which candidates can produce that value.

76
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,540
It's a risky business, right?

77
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,390
And it's impossible to know for certain until they start working at the company and start producing

78
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,980
results.

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,850
But there are a few ways of companies finding out.

80
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,340
That's what they interview for.

81
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,730
That's why they have coding challenges or coding interviews.

82
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,860
And another one is to see if somebody else wants them.

83
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,150
If another company wants you, that means you succeeded through their interviewing process.

84
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,820
When you're interviewing at big companies and you have an offer from a big company or a competitor.

85
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,030
Let's say you're interviewing at Microsoft and Google just made you an offer.

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,080
You should definitely mention that even the company name to Google so that.

87
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,120
They know you're wanted.

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,610
That creates a lot of social proof.

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,310
So remember, no matter how useless or pointless you think this email to other companies may be, you

90
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,500
want to send this signal to everybody, letting them know that a company wants you.

91
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,680
It's a huge, powerful negotiation tool.

92
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,450
Finally always know when the deadline is to respond to an offer.

93
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,160
Be honest with them and tell them that you're waiting on other offers from other companies and you want

94
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,170
to make sure that you make the right decision.

95
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,610
They may want to try and rush you and tell them that you have to give them an answer by tomorrow.

96
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,220
And you have to ask yourself, is that the type of place that you want to work?

97
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:36,030
They should respect your time and the fact that you are trying to figure out the best option when you're

98
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,380
declining an offer.

99
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,470
Be polite and don't burn any bridges.

100
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,330
Don't be mean because you never know when you might see them down the road.

101
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,890
Or the person who is the recruiter there might move to a different company.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,140
And you never know when good relationships might take you further along down your career.

103
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,690
So let's go over a few things.

104
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,790
What should you do?

105
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,420
The first thing is, when you receive an offer, you should know exactly what salary you want.

106
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,190
You have to go in there knowing what your value is, what you're willing to get paid.

107
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,450
You need to make sure that you do your research on the average industry pay.

108
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,420
You want to make sure that you're getting paid what the average professional in your industry is getting

109
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,770
paid or above it.

110
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:29,230
So you want to do your research and use websites like Salary.com, Glassdoor dot com, pay scale dot

111
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,570
com, or just simply Google it and I'll leave resources for you to find this out after this video.

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,770
The next.

113
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,920
What value do provide, you know, what type of salary you want, but really ask this question and be

114
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,970
able to answer yourself What value are I going to provide for the company?

115
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,190
What would you improve in the company?

116
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,540
What type of traits do you have that make you a valuable hire?

117
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:02,650
Think about how the company is going to derive value from you and by doing this research beforehand.

118
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,750
You're able to use this when negotiating your salary and you can mention how you would provide value

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:17,500
and why you deserve perhaps a higher salary or a higher offer than they've currently given.

120
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:26,460
And then finally, you want to always go higher than what you wish to get, because most likely they're

121
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,030
not going to agree with your initial demands.

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,400
And you want to meet somewhere in the middle where both parties feel like they have a win win situation.

123
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,690
So if you know your salary, you know what value you're going to provide to the company.

124
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:47,670
Then when perhaps talking about an offer going to that negotiation and make sure that your initial start

125
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,130
is higher than where you might land.

126
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,430
That's it for now.

127
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,790
Let's talk about an even more exciting topic in the next video, which is what to do if you're lucky

128
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,500
enough to get multiple offers.

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,970
I'll see you in the next one.

130
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,960
Bye bye.
