00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.620
What do I do if I don't have enough experience?

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.440
What if I'm underqualified for a job?

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.480
Well, first of all, you should have this mentality mind when applying to jobs and apply to jobs that

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.970
you feel you are under qualified for.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.230
If a job is asking you to do something that you already feel confident, then you should ask yourself,

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.840
What am I going to learn in this job?

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.280
Am I going to learn?

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.890
Actually, is this job going to put things on my resume that will make me get better and get a better

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.180
position in the future?

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.340
Or am I just going to do the same thing that I already know what to do or how to do it?

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.570
Finally, you have to keep in mind that job postings are put in order to weed out the weak candidates.

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.950
I have seen way too many of these created by non technical people or just making jobs sound tougher

13
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.720
than it really is to remove junior developers or engineers from applying.

14
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.740
So ask yourself, is this job going to be tough?

15
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.790
Good.

16
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.190
Then that is why you want.

17
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.870
That's what you should be doing.

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.710
Do you feel confident you are very qualified for this job.

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.260
Okay, then maybe you should push yourself and apply to a job that's more difficult than you think.

20
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.610
Every application should be a long shot.

21
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.290
If you're applying to something that you're 100% qualified for.

22
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.070
Where is your room to grow?

23
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.530
So dream big.

24
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.420
But in order to dream big, you might have a bit of a roadblock.

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.570
What if you don't have enough experience?

26
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.470
See, I don't love resumes and I don't think a lot of people do either.

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.710
But sometimes without a resume, you cannot get an interview.

28
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.340
And in order to have a good resume, you need to have something to put on it.

29
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.050
Like great experience.

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.640
Here's the cash.

31
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.380
So how can you have good experience if you're just getting started?

32
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.600
It's like you have no hope if you're a beginner or if you don't have enough work experience because

33
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.550
you're just out of school or you're changing careers.

34
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.890
Well, not quite.

35
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.910
As with everything, there's the regular way of doing things.

36
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.449
Then there's the smart way.

37
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
You see, experience doesn't come just from working at another company.

38
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.990
There are many ways that you can demonstrate experience without a past job.

39
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.360
And here you'll find my favorite ways to show and prove you can get the job done.

40
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.820
You won't have to do every single one of them, but two out of four of these, or even better, three

41
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.670
out of four will be great at showcasing on your resume and make you stand up.

42
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.630
So let's go in order and see how we can do this.

43
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.000
The first one is GitHub.

44
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.510
GitHub is a great way to demonstrate that you actually code that you've built projects.

45
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.790
The number one thing you can do is to start making commits and making sure that you have a good history

46
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.440
of things that you've done.

47
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.120
And by the way, if you're wondering how I got this cat picture in here, I'll show you a little trick

48
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.920
in the next exercise to make your contribution look a little bit nicer and busier in case you're just

49
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.740
getting started and you don't have a good past history.

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.830
Another way to improve your GitHub profile or to just add more experience is contributing and participating

51
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.330
in open source projects.

52
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:34.930
For example, I've created a Zero to Mastery organization where we have a ton of open source projects

53
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.990
by the community that you can contribute to.

54
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.180
And they're made specifically for you to mess up, make mistakes.

55
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.440
Nobody's going to yell at you.

56
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.840
These are just fun projects that are open source that you can contribute to and you can do as much or

57
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.980
as little as you want.

58
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.440
But this will improve your experience in contributing to open source projects, and it's something you

59
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.170
can add to your resumes now contributing to open source projects.

60
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.810
Recruiters love seeing this because this demonstrates you can work with others and also with something

61
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.460
like GitHub and version control.

62
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.360
All right.

63
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.530
Let's look at the next one.

64
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.740
The next one is website.

65
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.170
If you're especially a full stack or a front end developer or even a designer, you should have your

66
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.750
own website where you can showcase your skills.

67
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.800
This again, is something you can speak about in your interview and about how you built the website,

68
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.430
or it gives you a good way to talk about your past projects.

69
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.800
Now you're asking yourself, Oh, Andre, am I going to have to build a whole new website and waste

70
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.500
a bunch of time?

71
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.570
Well, not really.

72
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.010
Let me show you a couple of tricks.

73
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.850
You see, you don't need to build your own website from scratch.

74
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.060
There is a ton of free templates like Creative Tim here that just gives you a nice template for you

75
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.060
to use and fill in with your information.

76
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.090
We can also look at this one and again, free templates that you can use.

77
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.980
I especially like the mountain template and you can see that.

78
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.980
Yeah, I mean you can customize this to your own and make it look professional and it's already designed

79
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.660
nicely and also customized for different experiences such as mobile tablet.

80
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.860
And in a day you can have your own website.

81
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.870
And just to show you how you shouldn't really spend too much time on your own website, one of my favorite

82
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.150
people to follow is Kevin Kelly.

83
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.780
He is very, very popular among the tech community and is just an overall really smart thinker.

84
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.740
And you can see his website over here.

85
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.480
It's very simple.

86
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.480
Nothing exaggerated, very, very clean, but small, very basic layout.

87
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.340
And this is to show you that you don't need some crazy animations.

88
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.530
Make it all flashy to stand out.

89
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.890
As long as you have a personal website.

90
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.780
It just shows that you actually spend time building it and doing something that most people wouldn't

91
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.170
do.

92
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.640
Another thing that I want to show you is, for example, the job board that we have for all of my students.

93
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.630
And this is, again, another open source project that the community built.

94
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.750
If we just search through, let's say, Toronto developers here and we go to Christine.

95
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.760
I hope I'm saying the last name.

96
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.150
Right.

97
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.730
You can see how simple yet beautiful her portfolio is.

98
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.360
If we go to About Me, just a nice little bio with links to her profile.

99
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.260
If we go to projects, we see some of their projects and this is something that she can put on her resume

100
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.570
and immediately stand out from the crowd.

101
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.330
And it also gives her an opportunity to list projects that she can talk about when she gets to an interview.

102
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.080
All right.

103
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.460
Let's look at the next topic.

104
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.060
1 to 2 big projects.

105
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:04.280
Now you can't really fake experience if you've never built anything beyond a to do list or a Hello World

106
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.710
app.

107
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.880
You simply will not be able to get very good jobs.

108
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.610
However, most people think having 100 projects is the way to go.

109
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:20.990
So they do a project today and build small projects, many small, tiny projects to have 30 of them.

110
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.220
And they start building all these projects that are very, very simple.

111
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.240
Now, that's not actually impressive.

112
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.580
I mean, it shows that you're working hard and coding along.

113
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:38.540
But if I'm a recruiter and you show me a project of maybe tic tac toe, well, that's I don't really

114
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.810
care.

115
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.640
That's something that anybody can build with a bit of coding experience in a day or two.

116
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.200
Frankly, no recruiter or interviewer is going to check out all your 30 projects.

117
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:55.040
Most of the time we want to hear your most difficult or the hardest, biggest project you've worked

118
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.370
on.

119
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:02.660
Instead of spending your time on these small little projects, spend your time on one or two big projects.

120
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:12.300
For example, in other courses that I teach, we built a face recognition app and this app, well it

121
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:19.790
has a front end using reaches a back end where we have a restful API server with EXPRESS.

122
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.790
We've deployed it to Heroku, we've created session management with authenticated routes.

123
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:35.700
We store user information such as username and also hashed passwords securely in our database on post.

124
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:45.870
Chris We've deployed our app with Docker and we've also used Redis for session management and caching.

125
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.040
Now all of that may not mean a lot to you, but having something like a one big project that you can

126
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.920
talk about, all these things will make you sound a lot more impressive than somebody that just builds

127
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.350
a ton of tiny projects.

128
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.370
So focus on that.

129
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.740
Have 1 to 2 big projects that you can show off, makes you stand out.

130
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.320
And it also going to give you something to talk about during the interview and put it up on your website

131
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.620
or create its own website and you immediately can put this as the first item on your resume.

132
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.600
Because here's the thing.

133
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.740
If you don't have work experience, if we go back to the resume we used in the exercise, remember this

134
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.490
resume?

135
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.460
Well, if you had no work experience.

136
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.450
Maybe for work experience.

137
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:41.410
You can say something like JavaScript developer or web application developer and talk about how you

138
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.820
build your project here.

139
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:50.040
Because to a recruiter, it doesn't really matter if you worked at a certain company building an application

140
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.400
or on your own, or that could be a little bit vague, too.

141
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.720
They don't need to know that.

142
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:01.200
They just need to know that you build things that are real, that are big and complicated, and you

143
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.490
solved heart problems.

144
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:11.220
So having one or two big projects that you can list on your experiences is a great way to add to your

145
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.000
resume.

146
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.630
If you don't have enough past work experience at companies.

147
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:22.520
And I have a few students who have actually used this technique to get interviews, even though they

148
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.680
just learn how to code six months ago.

149
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.470
And then finally we have the blog posts or blog.

150
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.720
Let's have a look at what I mean by that.

151
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.450
This is another thing you can include in your resume.

152
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.310
Especially if it's related to a technology you're using or the company is using.

153
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:50.740
For example, I have here my medium profile and medium.com allows anybody around the world to just post

154
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.550
a blog post, and it's very popular with the tech community.

155
00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:00.070
So there's a lot of tech related posts that you can write on Medium and there's other platforms like

156
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:00.500
this.

157
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.570
What if you wrote a blog post about a specific technology that the company you're applying for is using?

158
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:14.540
Or some sort of a technical problem that they're facing by doing that and just adding a link to that

159
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.740
blog post, it gives you, again, another leg up to most people.

160
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.790
And the great thing about platforms like this is that, well, if we go to one of my articles here,

161
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:31.610
you can post it to what we call publishers and publishers allow your post to be discovered by others.

162
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.410
And it's very simple to do.

163
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.030
You can write a blog post on Medium in a day and submit it to a place like Hacker Noon.

164
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.800
And lots of people see it.

165
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:48.200
And as soon as you show this to a recruiter or an interviewer, again, it automatically shows that

166
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.190
you know what you're talking about, or at least it makes you stand out from the rest.

167
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.310
And you can do this with YouTube videos as well.

168
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.670
But I prefer writing because it's a lot faster and it looks a lot more professional.

169
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.450
So let's just review here.

170
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.780
What happens if you don't have enough experience?

171
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:11.140
Well, all of these four points allow you to gain that experience or show that you have experience without

172
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.890
actually having traditional work experience.

173
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:21.400
All you need to do is start something on your own and build something like a project or a portfolio

174
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.200
or a blog post.

175
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.350
This only shows initiative, but you can focus this project on solely getting your interviews, or you

176
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.630
can participate in a hackathon or contribute to open source projects.

177
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:41.240
By taking this initiative, you're doing more than most people that hope to just land an interview by

178
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.730
sending a generic resume.

179
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.960
You'll immediately stand out from the crowd and give you something to put on your resume.

180
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.080
That, again, is different than the average developer.

181
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.810
Plus you have the added benefit of something to talk about in your actual interview.

182
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.580
Remember, nothing is given to you for free.

183
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.000
And luck is for those who rather wait than go after what they want.

184
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.530
So by simply building something just for fun, such as a side project, you're showing how self motivated

185
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.880
ambitious you are.

186
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.420
Experience doesn't mean on the job experience.

187
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:24.300
Write about your portfolio projects, maybe talk about your website and how you built it.

188
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:29.700
Talk about your GitHub profile, maybe a hackathon you participated in, or open source projects you've

189
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.300
worked on.

190
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.120
Write a blog post on a specific technology that the company you're applying to is using.

191
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.910
All of them answer this question.

192
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.260
Do you have experience?

193
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.270
Finally, there are many things that you can add that are not developer related but can make you a great

194
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.930
employee.

195
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.260
For example, did you work as an instructor at a camp?

196
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.660
Well, you can now add ability to manage people and communicate well with others.

197
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.310
Any skill that is related to getting the job done can be included.

198
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:08.250
Also, if you have only had six months of coding experience, don't show that on the resume.

199
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.700
That doesn't mean to lie, but to hide that information.

200
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.630
Because a recruiter only glances at your resume.

201
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.090
They won't care if you're the best developer in the world.

202
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.150
If they just see six months experience, that's too risky for them.

203
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.700
Your resume will most likely be discarded no matter how good of a developer you are.

204
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:34.150
So remember, resumes are only good to get your foot in the door by tweaking your resume to show that

205
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:40.120
you have experience so that the recruiters thinks, Oh, interviewing this person is low risk because

206
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.300
they know what they're talking about is a good way of doing it.

207
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:50.060
Do you have past experience having made good decisions in the past and have you worked on a challenging

208
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.560
problem and solve them?

209
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:58.190
If you're able to answer yes to that, well then a recruiter is most likely going to ask you for an

210
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:58.730
interview.

211
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.850
I'll see you in the next video.
