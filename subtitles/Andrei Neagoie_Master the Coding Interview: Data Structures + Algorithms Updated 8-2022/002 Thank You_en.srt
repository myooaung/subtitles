1
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:05,090
If you never ask, the answer is always no.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,140
You should value yourself.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,560
Most importantly, you should value the fact that you are giving your most precious resource.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,990
That is time to an employer.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,830
Make the right choice when selecting employers.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,750
It is as much about what you want as it is about what they want.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,990
Work for a company that respects your time.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,930
Otherwise, why would you want to be there?

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,090
Good luck out there and thank you for being part of the course and the community and for supporting

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,720
my work.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,740
I promise to create content that is not just for marketing, but that actually improves your skills.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,350
I hope you keep following me in this journey and I hope you have a successful career.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,090
I'll see you in the next one.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,250
Bye bye.
