00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.840
We just implemented our own stack and hopefully you're able to code along as well in your own language.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.450
Now, here's my next challenge to you.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.470
What if we used a raise for this stack?

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.840
Up until this point or what we've quoted in has been with a lengthy list that we've created.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.280
How would you change the code if you want to implement this in an array?

7
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.400
And the hint here is that it's going to be super, super simple.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.520
It's going to involve deleting a lot of this code because while arrays already have push and pop.

9
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.190
So my challenge to you is to convert this stack data structure to use arrays instead of linked lists.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.580
Good luck and I'll see you in the next video.
