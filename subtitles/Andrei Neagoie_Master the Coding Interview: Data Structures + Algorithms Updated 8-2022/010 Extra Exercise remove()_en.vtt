00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.540
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.350
We have a bit of a bonus exercise.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.080
Now you can skip over this exercise because it is a little advanced and you most likely won't encounter

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.260
it in an interview.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.480
But for those who are curious, that is how to implement the remove method in here.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.950
If we wanted to remove an item from a tree, how would we go about doing it?

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.540
Now, if you want to try and implement this, I want to give you a heads up.

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.850
The best way for you to visualize and see what steps we need to do is to go back to visual.

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.330
Go make sure that you move the speed to the slowest so you see what's happening and you start removing

10
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.900
some notes to see what the logic is in removing notes.

11
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.100
Some steps are really easy.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.550
If we wanted to remove one for example, is, well, we simply traverse and find one and just remove

13
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.880
it.

14
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.220
But then there's other cases that gets really complicated, such as What do we do when we remove 51?

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.730
Well, if I click play here and say Remove 51.

16
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.680
Well, you'll see that we're going to start traversing to find 51 and notice what happens when we find

17
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.400
51.

18
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.440
We actually keep going.

19
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.000
To 55.

20
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.900
And then we keep going to 54 and watch this.

21
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.720
We split things and move 54 up.

22
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.360
And I know that's really, really confusing.

23
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.580
You might want to do this a couple of times to see what the logic is, but essentially what we're doing

24
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.000
is we're finding what we want to replace, going to the right of it, then the left and placing the

25
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.620
left item to the top.

26
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.830
Like I said, this is going to be a little bit advanced.

27
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.450
But if you want to challenge yourself using the visual, go animation.

28
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.710
Try to figure out how to implement your own remove method.

29
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.240
And in the next video, I'll show you my solution and go over the steps that we take for this to work.

30
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.330
I'll see you in the next one.

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.570
Bye bye.
