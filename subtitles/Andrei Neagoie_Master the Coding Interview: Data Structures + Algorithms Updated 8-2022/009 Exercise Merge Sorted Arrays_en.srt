00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,540
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,950
It's time to do another fun array interview question.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,760
An interviewer asks you.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,640
Given two arrays that are sorted.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,310
Can you merge these two arrays into one big one that's still sorted.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:30,340
So if I have a function called merge sorted arrays and I give it two parameters with two sorted arrays,

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:38,200
can you make it so that it returns 0344, six, 30, 31, as you can see, completely sorted.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's see what you can come up with and I'll see you in the solution video.

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,040
Bye bye.
