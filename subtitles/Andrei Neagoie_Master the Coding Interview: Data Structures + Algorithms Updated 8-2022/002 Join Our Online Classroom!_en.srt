1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,800
Hey there.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,980
This is Andre.

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,260
You're about to dive into the course.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,860
But here's the truth.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,370
Most people won't finish this course.

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,570
Why?

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,910
It's because doing a course from the comfort of your home is going to take something away.

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,830
That is one of the most critical parts of doing anything challenging and worthwhile.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,780
Accountability.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,440
It's a lot harder to stop going to elementary school than to stop watching an online course.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,070
Right.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,450
But here's the thing.

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:37,000
There is a way to guarantee right now that you will finish the course and you will get through the XHTML

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,970
courses no matter how hard they get.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,690
And trust me, it's going to get hard because we want to teach you really valuable skills.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,350
And they are valuable because they're hard to acquire.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,240
And this is why you're here.

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,350
If you don't finish the course, it's a waste of your money.

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,600
But if you finish the course, we truly believe it will get you the skills that you want.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,720
So this is why you're going to do that.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,870
Might put you outside your comfort zone, but it will be extremely effective in increasing your chances

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,130
of success.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,280
Ready for it?

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,120
You're going to come join our online classroom.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,460
In the next lecture, I'll provide a private link only for XDR-TB students.

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,850
In there, there are three things I will ask you to do.

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,330
One is to introduce yourself to the community.

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,970
You can share as little or as much as you want about yourself.

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm going to finish x course by this date and put that date in your calendar to.

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,010
Number two, go to Accountability Buddies channel.

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,810
Oh, that's a that's a mouthful.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,730
And find someone who is starting a team course right now at the same time.

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,680
It doesn't have to be the same course.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,870
And you can have multiple partners.

35
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,910
You're going to make sure that you each finish the course and the goals you set out to do.

36
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,830
Finally, number three, hang out in the general chat and talk about anything that you want.

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,640
You will also have course specific channels that you can chat in.

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,850
You want to be surrounded by other learners like you to stay motivated and being part of a class.

39
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,850
Now in here, we're also going to have virtual hangout sessions with myself, other Zoom instructors

40
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,800
and students.

41
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,330
I recommend having the discourse server open as you go through the course and as you are learning.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,480
Now, I'm not saying this to sell you something.

43
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,910
This is simply a fact of learning.

44
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,630
When you learn in a group, when you surround yourself with other learners, when you have accountability,

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,790
you are more likely to succeed.

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,050
It's a fact.

47
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,420
Finally throughout the course, as you encounter problems or challenges, don't give up.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,110
Come back to our Discord server and ask questions and get help.

49
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:57,440
But most importantly, as you start to learn and grow your skills, come here and help out other students.

50
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,990
Teaching and helping others is one of the best ways to retain the information you just learned.

51
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,680
If you create this routine around your learning, opening up discord, start watching the lessons.

52
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,160
Surround yourself with others that have similar goals to you.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,950
You will have the accountability and the support system to finish the course, I promise you.

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,050
Oh, and another fun bit.

55
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,510
When you finish the course, you post your certificate in the alumni channel to become an alumni.

56
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,410
And then, who knows?

57
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,970
The people that really are stars of the community become star mentors.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,780
Ooh.

59
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,600
Now, this all may sound silly.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,970
You may say that you don't need anybody.

61
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,300
But trust me, we've been doing this for many years, and there is this consistent trend of those that

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,740
finish the course, get hired, and find success in their careers.

63
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,630
You have to do the things that are uncomfortable sometimes to succeed.

64
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,430
So that's it.

65
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,520
See you in the next lecture and see you in our community.
