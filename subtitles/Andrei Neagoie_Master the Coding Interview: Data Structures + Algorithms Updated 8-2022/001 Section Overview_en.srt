00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome to the best part of landing a job.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,220
You've done all the coding exercises you can do.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,230
You've prepared for the interview.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,590
You've done the interview.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,500
You've answered all the questions.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,300
And now you wait.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,180
And hopefully you hear back with good news.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,070
But the game doesn't really end there.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,600
As a matter of fact, this is the fun part.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,540
This is what you worked for.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,380
And there's an easy, obvious way of going about it, which is not practicing and not learning how to

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,710
handle offers or negotiation or a bit of a harder way where we learn how to do these things properly

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:46,640
so that overall we're able to have higher salaries, work for better companies, and just overall be

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,260
more satisfied with our jobs.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,810
So we're going to take some time in this section to learn these skills that, again, will allow you

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,530
to grow a lot faster and be more satisfied with your jobs.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,690
Let's have a look at what are we going to talk about?

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,540
In this section, we're going to talk about how to handle an offer when after the interview, somebody

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,360
says, hey, congratulations, we want to work with you.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,540
Here's your offer.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,550
What do you do?

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,230
Do you just say yes?

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,020
What about handling multiple offers?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,510
A lot of people don't talk about this, but when you're interviewing, most likely you're interviewing

25
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,670
at a lot of companies and most of the time you're not just getting one offer, you're getting multiple

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,150
ones.

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,680
How does this work and how can you actually use them to improve the actual offers that you get?

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,760
We're going to talk about an important topic of handling rejection.

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,800
We're all going to get rejected one day.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,990
I don't think I've ever met anybody who's been accepted to every single job that they've applied for.

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,930
We're going to talk about getting a raise and how it's actually a lot simpler than you might think.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,820
And obviously, we're going to be talking about negotiation and some of the negotiation tactics and

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,690
techniques that is going to help you throughout these other videos and other lessons to prepare you

34
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,980
for the real world.

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,170
So lots to cover.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,520
It's going to be a fun one.

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,539
Let's get started.
