00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's quickly review what we know about resumes.

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.780
Well, they should be one page.

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.810
That's it.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.570
Don't cram everything into it.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.130
Make it clean and simple.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.329
Only include relevant positions and things that make you stand out.

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.300
Make the resume be very clear into what you did.

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.820
And don't use any vague language.

9
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.480
I did this and it resulted in this.

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.120
Why you did, how you did it, and what were the results?

11
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.350
Make it measurable.

12
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.360
Personalize your resume instead of just emailing 100 companies.

13
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.700
Try focusing on a few companies and personalize that resume to them.

14
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.250
And finally, make sure there's some sort of an online presence that they could check out in case they

15
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.660
want to find out more about you.

16
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.480
And at the end of the day, you have a few seconds to get the person looking at your interview to say,

17
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.290
hmm, this person is smart and can help this company.

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.710
Because remember, a resume is a piece of paper that someone will look at for a few seconds to decide

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.830
to give you a phone interview or an in-person interview.

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
So you don't want to spend a lot of time on it, but make it so it is effective.

21
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.640
It won't get you a job.

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.680
You've got to remember that.

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.010
Well, we'll get you the job is your projects, your interviewing skills, things we're going to cover.

24
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.740
Finally, be honest with your resume.

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.300
Most companies will ask you questions about your resume and they can tell you if you made it up.

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.050
It's better to be 100% honest and be able to know 100% about the projects that you worked on and the

27
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.280
resume items, because that's something that you're going to talk about in the interview.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.770
I also want to show you a nice little tool.

29
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.710
They're fun little tools like job scan, where you can actually paste your resume.

30
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.790
Paste the job description and you can scan it.

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.060
And it will tell you how well your resume does, and it will give you tips on how you can improve that

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.940
resume to match the job that you want.

33
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.259
But you may have noticed a problem with resumes.

34
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.600
What if you don't really have that much experience or things to put down?

35
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.750
What do you do in that case?

36
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.240
What if I'm underqualified for a job?

37
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.460
What if I've only been a developer for six months?

38
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.240
What if I'm self taught with no previous experience?

39
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.780
What if I have nothing to put on my resume?

40
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.660
We're going to tackle that question in the next video.

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.250
I'll see you in that one.

42
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.270
Bye bye.
