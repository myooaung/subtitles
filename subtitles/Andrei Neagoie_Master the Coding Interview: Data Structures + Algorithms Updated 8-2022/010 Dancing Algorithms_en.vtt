00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.100
I want to show you the greatest thing ever in computer science, especially when it comes to algorithms.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.320
I'm going to link to this channel because I just think is the greatest thing ever.

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.130
Also, the comments are absolutely hilarious.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.690
If you're a nerdy like me.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:30.510
Somebody created a sort of algorithm dance playlist where they take different sorting algorithms and

7
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.630
show them how they work with some traditional music.

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.650
Let's say traditional Romanian music, traditional Hungarian music.

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.000
Traditional Transylvanian Saxon folk dance, and they show different sorts.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.490
So you can check out bubble sort, which we've talked about or selection sort, which we're doing right

11
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.250
now to help you with your exercise and to write your own algorithms for the exercises.

12
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.110
Not only is the music just absolutely amazing.

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.459
It really, really helps you with how sorting algorithms work.

14
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
By the way, my favorite one is the quicksort one, which we're going to get into.

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.950
It's the best dance to see, especially if you do it at two x speed.

16
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.610
To speed.

17
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.600
These dancing's become really, really fun to watch and really help you up.

18
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.450
Anyway, this is a little fun thing to do with your exercises when you're trying to figure out how to

19
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.880
write and implement your own sorting algorithms.

20
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.900
I think this is the best way to visualize things, to show you how they work.
