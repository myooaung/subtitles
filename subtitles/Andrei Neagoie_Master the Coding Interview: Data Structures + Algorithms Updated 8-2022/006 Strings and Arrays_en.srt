00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,609
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:06,800
I wanted to add a quick video to let you know about a common interview trick.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,860
We're going to be doing some array questions after this.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:19,170
But in interviews, you should treat any string questions like over here as an array question.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,840
You see, strengths are simply array of characters.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,390
Most of the time in an interview.

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:34,280
When you get a question like reverse a string, what you should be thinking is to convert this into

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,060
an array.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:43,250
Do some sort of a loop on it or an operation using something like a split method in JavaScript and then

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,990
returning it as a string after you've finished the operations with them.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,030
So that is a very common interview question where you're manipulating strengths.

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,820
Just keep that in mind and will actually demonstrate this in the next video when we do a very common

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,720
interview question.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,820
I'll see you in that one.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,960
Bye bye.
