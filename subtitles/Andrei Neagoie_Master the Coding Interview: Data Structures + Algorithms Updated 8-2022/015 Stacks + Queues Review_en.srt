1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,370
And there we have it.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,230
We've learned Stacks and Qs.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,600
And an easy way to remember them is just simply plates and waiting line.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,320
We learned why they're built on top of other data structures like link lists and arrays.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:22,960
And we also talked about how to build stacks with the raise and link lists and also why we might not

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,100
want to use an array to build queues and also built a queue data structure with link lists.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,820
We learned that stacks and queues are great for some fast operations that they have, such as removing

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,020
or inserting, such as at the end of the data structure.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,740
We can also access the very first item in a queue or the very top item in a stack.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,070
And we also have all our data ordered, which is really, really nice, but we don't usually use our

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,050
stacks or Qs to really do any sort of lookup or search through the data structure.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,940
All we're interested in is the end bits of the data structure, so they make it really useful by restricting

13
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,760
our use of what we can do when it comes to Stacks and Qs, but making sure that what we're allowed to

14
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,660
do with these data structures are going to be really, really fast.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,890
And there we have it.

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,310
We've continued to expand our mind map of data structures.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,100
So we completed our stacks.

18
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,900
We learned how to create stacks with arrays and link lists.

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,500
We've learned about their bingo notation and we also talked about Qs and how we wouldn't really want

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,200
to use an array for our cue.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,450
A very common interview question.

22
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,830
We learned how to use a linked list to create a queue, and also we learned about the bingo implications,

23
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,130
which is very similar to stacks.

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,250
We're getting closer and closer to filling out this mind map.

25
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,870
But before we do that, we still have a few more data structures to go.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,240
But the end is almost near.

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,600
We only have trees and graphs to talk about.

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,250
For that.

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,410
I'll see you in the next part.
