00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.760
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.040
It's time for a little exercise.

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.030
Why do you think link lists may be better than hash tables or arrays?

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.570
Just from what we know right now.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.440
I want you to answer this question in your head or write it down before you go into the next video.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
I also want to show you a nifty little tool that I will link to in this video.

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.340
And this little visual shows you how a linked list works.

8
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.610
So you can play around with it and see where they might shine over a phrase or hash tables.

9
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.580
You see over here, we have a head with a value of 22 and a tail with a value of 89 and then other nodes

10
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.750
connecting all of them.

11
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.050
And you can use this website to do anything to a linked list.

12
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
You can create, you can search, you can insert, you can remove.

13
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's do a insert here.

14
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.450
I can either insert to the head if I click here.

15
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.000
And if I click, go.

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.050
I enter the value 85.

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.520
I can insert to the tail at the very end if I hit go.

18
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.900
All right.

19
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.760
That seems pretty simple.

20
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.990
Nothing too crazy.

21
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.660
What if we insert somewhere in the middle?

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.080
If I click over here and let's say an index of two, I want to insert the value of 90 or let's increase

23
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.160
that to 93.

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.360
I hit go.

25
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.330
Keep an eye on what's about to happen.

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.140
Oh, boy.

27
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.220
What just happened?

28
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.740
Don't worry.

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.370
It looks a little bit complicated.

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.740
And we're actually going to code this all ourselves and build this in.

31
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.500
But I want you to play around with this data structure and in your head come up with why you might want

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.060
to use something like this.

33
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.710
And in the next video, I'm going to tell you all about it so you can test whether your assumptions

34
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.490
are correct.

35
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.300
I'll see you in the next one.
