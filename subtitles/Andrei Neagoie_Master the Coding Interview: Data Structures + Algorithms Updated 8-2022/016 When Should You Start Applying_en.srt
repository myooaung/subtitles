1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,460
When should I start applying for a job?

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:10,850
This is especially common for people who are looking for their first coding job because they're new.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,640
They aren't sure how valuable their skills are.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,880
And we all have heard of the imposter syndrome where we think that everybody knows a lot more than us

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,160
and that we are just an imposter pretending to be engineers.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,110
So I want to answer this question for you.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,990
A short version and a long version.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,380
Short answer.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:40,140
Oh, when should you start applying is well, now, because you need to start looking at interviews

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,560
not as a win or lose, fail or pass.

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,660
Rather, as with anything, it is a skill that you can improve and get better at.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,090
Each interview that you go to will make you a better interviewer.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,900
Practicing is the key here, and the sooner you start interviewing, the better.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,230
Now there's a catch here and we'll need to go into the longer answer for that one.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,360
Assessing readiness is related to calculating the actual value and salary of a developer.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,490
And that's tough to do.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,290
When will you know that you're a front end engineer or a back end engineer?

18
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,840
Most of the time, you see on the job description items that you don't even know of or are not the master

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,030
of or requiring way more experience or way more years of experience than you have.

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,770
First things first.

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,490
Companies do this to filter out the weak candidates.

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,510
As a matter of fact, if you're applying to a job where you check all of the boxes and you know everything,

23
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,380
then that means you are getting a job where you already know what to do.

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,370
You want grown this role as much as tougher positions, will you?

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,800
So you need to change your mindset here.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,210
A job description is simply a guideline of what type of work you will be doing, not what type of work

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,830
have you done in the past?

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,490
With that said, if you don't know how to code at all and you apply for a developer position, well,

29
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,320
don't expect a positive result.

30
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,790
You need to have some fundamentals before you actually start applying.

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,120
Luckily for you, the criteria is very simple.

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,720
Do you know the fundamental building blocks of computer science, like data structures and algorithms

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,610
like we're going to learn in this course?

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,700
In your specific domain, have you built some projects and can build something on your own?

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Other than a simple Hello World project?

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,110
Do you have one or two big projects using the related technologies that the job description has?

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,810
If that's the case, well, you should start applying.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,910
Your skills will continue to grow.

39
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,570
And I can count numerous times when people in my company got hired over people with more experience

40
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,540
because hiring developers or engineers is more than just technical knowledge.

41
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,040
Once you meet a baseline, that is the minimum requirement.

42
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,950
The rest comes down to non technical parts of the interview again, which we have a whole section on

43
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,730
in this course.

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,800
So when should you apply?

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,910
Now.

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,120
Use it as practice, just like with anything.

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,240
If you wait until you feel you're ready, you're ready.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,290
Waited too long.

49
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,990
Remember this quote If you never ask?

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,820
The answer is always no.

51
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,470
So start applying now.

52
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,240
I'll see you in the next video.

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:32,990
Bye bye.
