00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.660
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.600
LinkedIn is one of the best things that has happened to the job market.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.450
Now, depending on your geographic location, you'll see different levels of activity for LinkedIn.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.240
So this is something that you'll have to consider for yourself and make sure that LinkedIn is a good

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.650
option for your location.

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.760
Now let's have a look at LinkedIn so we can talk about it and also to see if it's a viable option for

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.540
yourself.

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.560
The best way to actually see if it's worth your time to invest in a LinkedIn profile is to actually

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.140
just do a search for jobs.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.530
And in here you can do all sorts of filters.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.330
But if I go to all filters, you can look for jobs based on your location and the type of job that you're

12
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.080
looking for.

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.550
If there are jobs, then perhaps you need a LinkedIn profile because, well, this is a great way to

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.940
apply to jobs, which you can do on LinkedIn, but also have recruiters contact you through LinkedIn,

15
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.090
which actually happens a lot.

16
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.580
And we're going to get into that a little bit later.

17
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.120
I personally think that LinkedIn is 100% better than resumes, and it's something that every single

18
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.010
person should have, especially if you want a job in the tech industry.

19
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.680
And by the way, I'm no specialist when it comes to LinkedIn.

20
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.630
And there's a lot of people in books that talk about how to optimize these things.

21
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.510
However, if you craft things well enough, you'll find you'll get contacted by recruiters constantly

22
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.830
on LinkedIn.

23
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.690
I actually have to add on my profile a little bit of a no recruiters please, because I would get contacted

24
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.160
so often by recruiters.

25
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.010
From my experience speaking with other people, when you have a good LinkedIn profile, you'll get contacted

26
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.180
for job offers, which again is a great thing to have in the back of your pocket as an extra way to

27
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.100
increase those odds of getting an interview.

28
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.720
So here's the keys to LinkedIn fast and quick.

29
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.560
Number one is to look for jobs and apply to jobs through LinkedIn.

30
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.190
Again, I showed you how to do that.

31
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.070
You can see what jobs are available and actually apply to them directly.

32
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.510
LinkedIn is pretty much like your resume, so it should have very similar items as your resume, whatever

33
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.420
it makes your profile complete.

34
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.250
Well, you should add it over here, just like I have done for myself.

35
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.570
Now, the interesting thing here is that recruiters for other companies and tech recruiters usually

36
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.580
search LinkedIn for candidates.

37
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.220
And what they do is they do keyword searches.

38
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.730
So if I'm a recruiter looking for, let's say, a python developer, I'm going to Google Python developer

39
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.010
and maybe check that a LinkedIn profile has the word Python in it.

40
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.190
Maybe I'll check that if I scroll down here that they're endorsed skills, where are they?

41
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.300
That skills and endorsements that this person has Python.

42
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.040
And perhaps whether this person changed their profile recently.

43
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.720
And that's a little trick.

44
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.420
Update your profile every week when you're looking for a job on LinkedIn since it's going to show up

45
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.830
in a recruiter's search result.

46
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.300
So even if it's a small change, such as just a little typo or a little space, it's going to show up

47
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.410
as an updated profile.

48
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.590
And recruiters are actually going to see that this person changed their profile recently, which means

49
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.960
they're more likely to be looking for a job and they're more likely to reach out to you.

50
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.650
So you can actually just do this every couple of days when you're looking for a job so that it increases

51
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.440
your odds of you getting onto recruiters.

52
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.340
Search Results.

53
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.920
You also want to include keywords that recruiters are looking for.

54
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.820
And I have an example here for you.

55
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:10.250
If I scroll to one of my positions here, I have a list of my favorite tools in 2017 and actually did

56
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.680
this strategically, because all these tools that I'm using are now keywords that if a recruiter or

57
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:27.350
a company is looking for somebody with MongoDB experience or maybe serverless architecture or Firebase

58
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.440
or any of these things, my profile includes those, so I'm going to show up in those results.

59
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.670
So think of it that way.

60
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.180
What are the key words that will make you more approachable?

61
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.240
Finally try to get recommendations from other people.

62
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.660
Message your friends or colleagues or coworkers and get them to refer you.

63
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.920
Not that recruiters or companies will read this, but again, when your profile shows up in searches,

64
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.270
it's more likely to be ranked higher up because you have these recommendations.

65
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.800
By the way, these skills and endorsements are things that will usually you get from people such as

66
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.170
your connections on LinkedIn.

67
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.360
It's really hard to get this number up.

68
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.100
So I've actually created a little group for us where if I go to groups and by the way, LinkedIn is

69
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:26.390
updating these, so it's going to actually change most likely from how you see it in the video.

70
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.440
And here we have members that you can connect with and actually ask for referrals, skills and endorsement

71
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.020
just to again boost your LinkedIn profile.

72
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.850
Finally something that we're going to talk about in the email section.

73
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.960
But some of the best way to get jobs is to not just blindly email companies that don't know anything

74
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.590
about you.

75
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.100
Getting referrals or being referred by somebody within the company is one of the best ways to do that.

76
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.740
And for me, myself, I'm not very sociable.

77
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.690
I don't really like networking and going to events or perhaps maybe I don't know somebody at a company

78
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.250
and there's no way for me to get a referral.

79
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.500
Well, LinkedIn allows us to do this by simply.

80
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.460
Searching for, let's say, Netflix.

81
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.050
I want to work a Netflix.

82
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.480
I'm going to click on this company.

83
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.140
Or actually if we go back and do Netflix.

84
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.520
And click on Netflix in people.

85
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.250
I'm going to look for people that work in Netflix.

86
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.540
If it works.

87
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.920
There you go.

88
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.860
A little bit slow there and I see here.

89
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.850
People that actually work in Netflix and some of my connections to them.

90
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.310
I see that I have shared connections and I can message somebody, I can connect with them.

91
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.340
I can also see that this person is actually a recruiter at Netflix and I have some sort of a shared

92
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.050
connection.

93
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.870
Maybe I should message her and see if I can get an introduction, or maybe I can pass my resume on to

94
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.610
her or set up a phone interview.

95
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.990
In other words, LinkedIn allows us to see that we have mutual friends and we can vouch for each other's

96
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.710
credibility, or perhaps contact somebody directly at Netflix that can get us an interview.

97
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.720
Again, it's all about being strategic and efficient and doing what most people aren't willing to do,

98
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.040
which will make you stand up.

99
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.230
All right.

100
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.370
So to review.

101
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.030
Update your LinkedIn profile with the skills that you have.

102
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.640
And according to the jobs that you're targeting, recruiters are going to use LinkedIn to look for candidates,

103
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.250
and they'll always search for users who have recently changed their profiles since it signals to them

104
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.930
that this person is looking for a job.

105
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:45.680
And also try to include the relevant skills and have those keywords ready so that you do show up in

106
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.730
those search results.

107
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.930
You can also apply to jobs directly through LinkedIn, and you can also find people a companies that

108
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.160
you want to work for that you can connect with message or get referrals from.

109
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.450
Again, something we'll talk a little bit more in detail in our email section.

110
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:09.200
Using a tool like this that allows you to be discovered while you're sleeping, just optimizes your

111
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:16.280
chance of getting interviews without making you spend a ton of time trying to get those interviews again

112
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.230
so you can focus on things that really matter.

113
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.710
I'll see you in the next video.
