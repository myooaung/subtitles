00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,140
What is a data structure?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,040
A data structure is a collection of values.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,830
The values can have relationships among them, and they can have functions apply to them.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,990
Each one is different in what it can do and what it is best used for.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:30,240
Most important thing to take away is that each data structure is good and is specialized for its own

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,750
thing.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,560
Hmm.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,330
All right, Andre, you just said a bunch of words, and I don't really understand.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,380
Well, let's show you a couple of images to simplify this.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,700
You see, you can think of data structures as any sort of compartment or container.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,020
A data structure is simply a file cabinet of different types.

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:00,190
You have a backpack, a place where you put maybe your school books, you have drawers where you put

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,280
your clothes, a fridge where you put your food, a folder for your files and a packing box, maybe

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,170
for your toys.

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,550
Each one of these containers are useful for its own thing.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,450
For example, I'm not going to put my food in a drawer over here because that yogurt is going to go

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,170
bad here.

19
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,760
Likewise, I'm not going to put all my papers and files in my backpack.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,070
Or perhaps a toy box because it's just going to get crumpled up.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,100
Each one of these containers are specific for its own thing, and that's what data structure really

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,670
is.

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:48,380
It's a way for us to organize data so that we can go into the backpack and retrieve that data really

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,830
easily.

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,710
We can go into the fridge and grab that popsicle or ice cream really fast.

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,320
We can put things in data structures and we can take things from data structures, and that's all it

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,130
really is.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,970
And there are a ton of data structures, just like in real life, how we have all these containers hold

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,650
these places to put things in.

30
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,350
In programming, we have a ton of them.

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,970
If we go to Wikipedia, for example?

32
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,210
Well, if we scroll through here, we see a ton of data structures and this is going to look overwhelming.

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,840
But don't worry, most of these well, I've never encountered myself, and they're very, very specific.

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,200
You probably only have about five or six data structures that are really, really important that we're

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,950
going to go over.

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,160
And.

37
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,980
You may have even heard of Bitcoin and how it uses blockchain technology, this magical word.

38
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,580
Well, blockchain at the end of the day is simply a data structure, a way to hold information.

39
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:04,960
So in our programming world, data structures, we can store things like numbers, strings, Boolean

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,510
types, just like we saw when we coded in JavaScript with arrays and objects.

41
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:18,040
Arrays and objects in JavaScript are each a form of a data structure that allows us to store information.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,410
You see as humans, this is what we do on earth, right?

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,810
We take the chaos and the disorder and make order out of it.

44
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,220
At least we try to.

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,590
We organize our farms to produce food.

46
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,110
We package the food.

47
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,380
And we deliver them to the grocery stores and organize them in the grocery store so that humans can

48
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:49,360
grab those and can then purchase these groceries and give money to put in a compartment and a bank.

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,950
That's what programs are.

50
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,500
We're modeling real life scenarios.

51
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:01,480
And the more advanced a developer you become, the more time you'll start thinking and spending time

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,730
talking about data structures.

53
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,540
This is why interviewers love to talk about data structures.

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,440
Now, as I always like to mention, there are always trade offs.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
Every programming question has a trade off.

56
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,600
Remember our three?

57
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,070
Pillars.

58
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,930
Of readability, memory and speed.

59
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,600
When we talked about what code is best, well, we have the same thing with data structures.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,130
One is better than the other in some aspects, and the other better than the other.

61
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,240
That's why they exist.

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Each one for its own specific case.

63
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,660
And there are two parts to understanding data structures.

64
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,050
One is how to actually build one.

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,310
How can we build with code some of these data structures?

66
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,840
And two is how to use them, how to use these data structures.

67
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,570
We're going to do both of these in this course.

68
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,440
But the second point is the most important, right?

69
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,760
Because data structures are usually just tools.

70
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,440
And most of the time they're already pre built for us.

71
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,940
The most important part is how to use them, when to use one over the other.

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,640
And we kind of saw a little bit of that in the previous section when we talked about how to solve problems

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,540
where we used an object versus an array to make our code more efficient.

74
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,890
The goal in this course is to understand data structure so that you can pick the right data structure

75
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,730
for your problem.

76
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,520
Based on different scenarios, data needs to be stored in a specific format.

77
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,250
We have a handful of data structures that cover our need to store data in different formats.

78
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,510
So let's get a little bit deeper into this topic.
