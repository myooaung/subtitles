00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.370
There we have it.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.430
We've just completed our data structure section.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.730
We went through all these data structures, even some sub data structures.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.490
And you know what?

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.360
We've completed a lot of this mind map.

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.990
We've talked about arrays.

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.620
We've talked about stacks and Qs.

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.770
We've talked about hash tables, link lists, trees, and all the types of trees that we have.

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.130
We even talked about graphs, all these little boxes that are data structures.

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.480
We now have an understanding of what they are and how they're used.

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.940
But there's a few other pieces of this, my map that we need to go through, and that is algorithms.

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.300
And you'll see algorithms depicted here in.

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.130
Rocket ships.

14
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.880
Our last piece of the puzzle.

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.590
But you might still have a few questions that haven't been answered.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:09.030
And there are some things that I left out because they apply more to algorithms when it comes to sorting.

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.520
We're going to use arrays and trees when it comes to dynamic programming.

18
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.790
We're going to be talking about hash tables when we talk about breadth, first search and depth first

19
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.270
search that's used in graphs and trees recursion.

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.840
Well, that comes up a lot in trees as well.

21
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.660
So now that we have our fundamentals for data structures, we're now ready to talk about these algorithms

22
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.240
that come up a lot in interviews because we now understand how data structures work.

23
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.210
We're able to talk about algorithms intelligently and understand them at a fundamental level.

24
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.610
I'll see you in the algorithm section.

25
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.080
Bye bye.
