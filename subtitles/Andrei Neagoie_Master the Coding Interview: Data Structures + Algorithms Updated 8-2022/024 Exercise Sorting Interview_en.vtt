00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.050
I hope your brain is not mush from all these sorting algorithms.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:14.330
I know I keep saying this, but sorting is one of my least favorite topics because there's just so much

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.990
to learn.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.810
And most people focus on just coding, sorting algorithms, which just doesn't apply in real life.

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.570
Most developers and engineers go their entire life, not ever coding a sorting algorithm from scratch.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.930
But we are going to encounter situations where we need to make decisions on which sorting algorithm

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.800
to use.

9
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.060
So to prepare you for that, I have a couple of questions.

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.640
And the questions are numbered here.

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.910
And I want you to answer each question.

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.450
If this was asked to you by your employer or a boss or maybe an interview, what type of sorting algorithm

13
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.270
you'd use based on this factor?

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.390
For example, we have ten schools around your house and you want to sort them by distance.

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.480
What type of sorting algorithm will use?

16
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.940
And you'll see here we have about eight questions.

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.780
Give it a try.

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.340
I'll link to this exercise and in the next video I'll give you my opinion.

19
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.440
Remember, there's always pros and cons with everything.

20
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.930
So really think about this and I'll see you in the next video.

21
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.950
Bye bye.
