1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:09,370
This is something that we started our course with the idea that when learning something with our limited

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:16,540
time and resource, we need to make sure that we understand the most important concept.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,450
Why are we learning this?

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,670
Why is this worth my time?

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,380
And why is this something that I should dedicate this time to?

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,040
Too often we see new things in the developer ecosystem.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,220
It is always exciting to be working on the newest and shiniest thing that everybody is talking about.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,180
But remember those libraries and frameworks and configuration files and tools?

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,760
Those things come and go.

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,620
They're always changing.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,480
You can be a master of Webpack one day and two years later nobody cares because there's a better tool

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,050
out there.

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,700
The things that stick around are the fundamental computer science topics and software development practices.

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,830
Sure, these things change over time as well, but they always evolve slowly.

15
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,230
With y in mind when learning new things.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,190
Make sure you understand why the solution was created.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,730
What problem is it solving and why is this the answer to your problems?

18
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,350
If you're able to do this, you stop being a player in the game of catch up and the developer ecosystem

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,440
always trying to learn the latest library, the newest tool, the coolest functions to learn.

20
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,580
It's like a game of hamster who's constantly trying to keep up with the wheel, trying to run on that

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:54,500
wheel, but instead be an observer who is watching the ecosystem evolve from above.

22
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,380
Watch how new libraries come and go.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,270
Understand the why of each libraries, what problems they solve.

24
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,440
Understand the big picture, why we do things.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,039
But be the observer, not the hamster.

26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,100
You'll have a happier, longer career overall.

27
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,950
Trust me, you won't be constantly trying to catch up with every library and framework this way.

28
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,630
This big picture vision is what makes a senior developer or a manager or a leader.

29
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,340
They don't have narrow vision.

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,790
They see the entire ecosystem and they are able to make smart decisions because of that.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,120
So always start with why.
