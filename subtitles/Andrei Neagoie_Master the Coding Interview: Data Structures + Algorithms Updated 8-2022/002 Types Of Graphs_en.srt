00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,830
As we saw, there are many types of graphs, but there are certain characteristics that allow us to

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,939
describe graphs.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,170
Let's go over them.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,860
One thing that you really want to get yourself familiar with is the idea of directed and undirected

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,460
graph.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,270
These types of graphs are useful for describing traffic flow, for example, of some kind of a system

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,980
in which movement is not bi directional.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,190
That means, unlike here, where I can go back and forth between nodes, I can only go in one direction.

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:43,220
A good way to think about undirected graph is to think of as a highway between two cities where you

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,510
can go back and forth.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,190
On the other hand, direct.

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,910
It will be a one way street where you can only go one way.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,510
Another way to think about it is Facebook.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,180
What kind of graph do you think Facebook has?

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:06,070
Well, it has an undirected graph because when I'm connected to a friend, that friend is also connected

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,670
to me.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,930
It's not one way.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,490
What about Twitter?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:20,020
Twitter is more directed because if I have my profile, people can follow me and I can follow people.

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,620
But if somebody follows me, I don't automatically follow them.

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,970
So Twitter is more directed.

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,950
Another way to describe graphs is the idea of weighted graphs, unweighted and weighted graphs.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,940
And as you can see from the images, values can be applied to various aspects of a graph, not just

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,720
the nodes.

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,540
Remember, the nodes can carry any type of information, but with graphs you can also have information

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,850
in the edges, in the connections.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,840
Maybe you're going on a trip and trying to figure out the most efficient way to visit sites that interest

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,200
you.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,280
Well, in that case, Google Maps would use a weighted graph to decide what is the shortest path for

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,060
you to get there.

31
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,330
And these sort of graphs are used a lot in calculating optimal paths.

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,620
The fastest way to get to, let's say, 1 to 6.

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,770
Lastly, another way to describe a graph is cyclic or a cyclic.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,030
When you have vertices connected in a circular fashion, it's called a cycle.

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,120
When you can go from one node to another to another and then back to that original node versus acyclic

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,260
where you can't do that.

37
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:46,260
And cyclic graphs are really common in especially weighted graphs such as Google Maps, because most

38
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,840
of the time there is a way to get back.

39
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,620
So now that we understand a few ways to describe graphs, let me show you my favorite graph of all time.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,940
This is my favorite graph.

41
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,840
It's by the optic project and it is a partial map of the Internet.

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,030
If you look here, you see that?

43
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:17,500
We have IP addresses connecting to IP addresses, and these are all nodes connected to create the Internet.

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,980
Pretty spectacular, right?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,900
That is the best example of a graph.

46
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:31,790
So now that we understand or at least have a basic understanding of graphs, let's do a nice, fun exercise.
