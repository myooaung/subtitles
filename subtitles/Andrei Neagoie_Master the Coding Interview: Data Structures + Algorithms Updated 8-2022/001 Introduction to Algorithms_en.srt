00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,130
Welcome to the Algorithms section.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,860
This is a word that immediately just sounds nice, right?

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,590
All the companies are using it these days to sound like they're doing something really, really important.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:23,470
Everybody has a secret algorithm that they use to make machine learning models, analyze user data,

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,630
make companies lots of money.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,580
But underneath the hood.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,030
Algorithms are just functions that programmers write.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,440
A two line function is technically an algorithm.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,410
A 1000 line algorithm that sorts through images is also an algorithm.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,750
Algorithms are simply steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers.

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:00,150
If we go to Wikipedia and search list of algorithms, the list is pretty endless.

12
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,110
There are a lot of algorithms.

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,250
It's impossible to know all of them.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,110
You can create your own algorithms.

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,890
You can use other algorithms that are popular and well established.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,450
But let's get back to our question of what are algorithms if we combine our knowledge of data structures?

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,340
The ones that we worked on in the previous sections.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:35,300
Algorithms allow us to use language built in data structures like arrays and objects or primitives such

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,470
as integers and booleans and even custom data types like we did when we use the class keyword to create

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,410
stacks cuz binary search trees.

21
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,990
Well, algorithms allow us to use these data structures to perform actions on that data.

22
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,950
Remember this, right?

23
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,950
Data structures and algorithms create programs.

24
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,350
In this course, we're going to talk about the most common interview algorithms.

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,500
So that long list on Wikipedia won't be as intimidating because we're only going to focus on the ones

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,780
that matter, especially for interviews, but also the ones that matter most in your career.

27
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,130
Specifically, we're going to go over these topics when it comes to algorithms.

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,760
Now, why are these algorithms so common in interviews and especially in big companies?

29
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,270
Well, you can get away with not knowing these topics for a long time as a programmer.

30
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,040
But as we have learned, bingo and scalability of code is important.

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,350
As companies get larger and larger.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,040
By learning these listed algorithms, we're able to do majority of the scaling we need to improve our

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,820
programs.

34
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,580
Remember our big O cheat sheet?

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:02,030
And how we haven't really talked about O log n and own log n, maybe a little bit in the previous videos.

36
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:12,810
Certain algorithms allow us to simplify our big complexity into smaller or better time complexity.

37
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,720
So that by using the right algorithm, I can take a function that has a big o of this notation down

38
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,400
to something of own log n or something that has a linear time complexity to o log of n.

39
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:35,370
And these are used everywhere in large companies because large companies handle lots of inputs, lots

40
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,180
of data.

41
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,470
So this topic is extremely important to them.

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,270
And as your career grows and grows, these topics will be more and more important to you.

43
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,470
So let's dive in to our first topic.

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,030
I'll see you in the next one.

45
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,140
Bye bye.
