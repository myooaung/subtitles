00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:09.650
In my opinion, this section is one of the most important topics for any software developer or engineer.

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.740
It also happens to be my favorite section of this course.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.310
No matter what company you work in, where you live, or even if you're coding ten years from now,

4
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.970
this is a concept that will be around for a long time and something that will truly make you a better

5
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.780
developer.

6
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.290
Bingo is something that I learned about 2 to 3 years into my career as a developer.

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.230
And it's so important.

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.940
It has made me a better developer, a better engineer, and it will for you as well.

9
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.540
Big companies like Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Amazon all know this, which is why you won't get by

10
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.880
any of their interviews, any of their phone interviews, any of their screening interviews without

11
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.410
encountering this topic.

12
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.500
So we're going to learn all about this very important topic, and that's why it's at the beginning of

13
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.220
the course.

14
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.440
All right.

15
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.620
Did I grab your attention?

16
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.130
Enough.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.050
So what are we talking about here?

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.030
It's called Big O and the official term is Big O.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.460
Asymptotic analysis.

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.430
If you want to sound super smart and impress your friends, you see any coder given enough time can

21
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.390
solve a problem.

22
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.860
What matters is, though, how well the problem is solved.

23
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.680
And this is where Big O can help us.

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.880
It can tell us how well a problem is solved.

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.160
We're going to find out about what that means in this section.

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.820
We're going to talk about Big O, what it is, how we define it, and then we're going to use Big O

27
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.560
and its different notation to distinguish that code from good code, good code from great code.

28
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.930
We are going to become comfortable with this topic that we are going to not be surprised when this comes

29
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.220
up in our interviews.

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.590
But we are also going to build this big foundation that is important to be a great developer.

31
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.139
The reason this topic is at the beginning of this course is that you will see this big o notation come

32
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:15.950
up again and again as we go into topics such as data structures and algorithms.

33
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.820
Like I said, this is my favorite section, so get ready because it's going to be a lot of fun.

34
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.350
See you in the next video.

35
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.310
Bye bye.
