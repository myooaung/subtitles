00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.600
So what are companies looking for?

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.360
Most people tend to think it's just coding skills.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.050
But as you can see here, there's actually four things that they're looking for.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.240
One is analytic skills.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.320
That is, how can you think through a problem and analyze things?

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.720
And when you're coding during an interview, they want to hear your thought process and how you go from

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.060
not knowing the answer to solving the problem.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.200
They're also looking at coding skills, which is Do you code well?

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.920
Is your code clean, well organized, readable?

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.420
They also want to obviously know their technical skills or technical knowledge.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.860
That is, do you know the fundamentals?

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.850
Did you just memorize things or do you understand the pros and cons of different solutions?

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.090
And then finally, your communication skills.

14
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.230
Does your personality match the company's personality?

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920
Can you communicate well with others with a team?

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.070
Most likely, you won't be working by yourself.

17
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.040
You're working with others, with other teams, with bosses, with managers.

18
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
And they want to know whether you're the type of person that's going to fit well and work well within

19
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.830
the company.

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.180
Again, most people get hung up on the idea of learning every single algorithm data structure, doing

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.790
1000 problems to practice before an interview.

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.500
And these are important.

23
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.270
But in most companies you don't actually need to know how to write a binary search tree or write a sorting

24
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940
algorithm from scratch.

25
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.320
I mean, we're going to go through that in this course, but most of the time you learn it on the go

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.690
on the job when you actually need it.

27
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.570
And let's be honest, as engineers, we know that most of the time when a problem presents itself,

28
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.930
we're good at searching the Web on Google for answers.

29
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.530
Not a single one of us has everything memorized in our head.

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.090
Companies know this.

31
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.400
They're not dumb.

32
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.750
What they're looking for are people who know how to look for answers, and they want to know that,

33
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.160
you know your data structures and algorithms and you know of their existence.

34
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.110
That's the key.

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.360
They want to know when you should use a certain data structure over the other.

36
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.910
Why should we use a certain algorithm over another?

37
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.460
At the end of the day, companies want smart people.

38
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.170
They want people that can solve problems that they cannot solve themselves because that's what they're

39
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.860
paying you.

40
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.760
And having worked at companies and also hiring people, it's surprisingly hard to find people that can

41
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.640
solve problems themselves without holding their hand or walking them through a problem entirely.

42
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.870
So moving forward, I ask of you to just do this one simple thing do all the exercises in the course,

43
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.090
pause the videos if you need to rewatch the videos, if you need to, you need to understand the why

44
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.110
of doing things.

45
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.850
Why are we learning this?

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.370
Why is this the answer to the problem?

47
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.100
Why is this answer better than the other?

48
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.900
Again, don't worry, we're going to practice this muscle throughout OC.

49
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.730
Let's dive into the next video to see what we're going to learn.

50
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.290
I'll see you in the next video.

51
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.040
Bye bye.
