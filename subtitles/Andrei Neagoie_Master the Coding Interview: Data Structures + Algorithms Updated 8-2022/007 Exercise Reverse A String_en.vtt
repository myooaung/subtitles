00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's get into some fun interview questions.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.920
We're going to start off with a very, very common one.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.950
And it shouldn't be too complicated to start us off.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.650
The interviewer asks you.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.510
Can you create a function that reverses a string?

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.950
So if you passed into this function right here.

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.730
Hi.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.410
My name is Andre.

10
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.270
It should return.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.020
This gibberish that is.

12
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.600
Oh, and I forgot.

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.510
And here this gibberish that is well backwards.

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.360
It's just simply reversing a string.

15
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.720
Now, I want you to go ahead and try this in your own reply, or whichever text editor you use and see

16
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.550
if you can think through the problem.

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.040
Use what you know about arrays to solve this.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.370
Now, keep in mind, when it comes to questions like these, there are many ways to do things.

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.590
As programmers, we know this right?

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.040
There are so many ways to solve a problem.

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.740
And depending on our style, our knowledge and time, we're going to come up with different solutions.

22
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.500
So if your answer is different than mine, well, that's not the worst thing.

23
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.950
What you want to be able to do is to think through a problem and understand why you made those decisions.

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.210
So go ahead, reverse a string and I'll see you in the solution video.
