1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,100
Let's talk about negotiating.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,890
Now, first off, I am no expert in negotiating or tactics.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,750
There are people who are better than me at this and there's a lot of cultural standards and norms that

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,650
may apply.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,770
So I'm going to tell you what has worked for me and also what I have seen work for others.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,120
Underneath it all, there are some few basic principles that can be applied, and this common theme

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,750
and common tactics is something that will help you as well.

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,250
But keep that in mind.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,260
Cultures do play a big role here.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,790
All right, let's get started.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,760
If you get asked, what salary do you want in an interview, what do you say?

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,780
Think about this for a second.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,010
You can pause the video.

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,690
What will be your answer when somebody asks you what are your salary expectations?

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,770
All right.

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,640
You thought about it?

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,050
This is what I would say.

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:02,290
Well, I know that the average software developer in Silicon Valley, let's say I'm applying there,

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,350
makes roughly 120,000 a year.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,650
So I think that's a good place for us to start.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,070
That was it.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,480
That's what I would say.

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,150
Now.

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,260
Why is that?

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,930
And this goes to my very first point.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,830
You don't want to end the conversation.

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,350
You see what I did here?

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,150
I didn't actually answer their question and say, Well, I want 90,000 per year.

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:36,190
All I did was do something called anchoring where I tell them, This is where we want our conversation

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,970
to start.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,040
I want the conversation to start around the number 130,000 a year.

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,650
And I'm not saying that this is what I want to get paid.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,900
This is just simply me starting our conversation so that we can talk about things.

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,680
All I said was the average software engineer in negotiation, especially when it comes to salary negotiation,

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,880
you're going to want to give an actual number to end the conversation.

36
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:09,380
Instead, you want to keep the conversation going by giving something like an industry average and make

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,390
it clear that you're merely starting the negotiation here and not ending it.

38
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,060
And that's how we start negotiating.

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,860
Let's talk about the next point.

40
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,430
We want to give reason for everything because we all know the problem with negotiating.

41
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,880
Right.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,910
If you say you want more salary or more vacation time, we kind of sound greedy.

43
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:39,390
We don't want to sound greedy and that we're money hungry and that all we do is care about these numbers

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,260
and ourselves.

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,660
As we know, nobody really likes greedy people.

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,110
Right.

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,140
As a matter of fact, this is the main reason people don't negotiate.

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,370
They just don't want to offend people and seem mean and and hungry just for money.

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,790
Instead, you want to give a reason for everything.

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,530
For example, if somebody gives you an offer and this is something that we'll talk in later on videos,

51
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,090
it says, hey, we are going to offer you 80,000 a year.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
What do you think?

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,180
Are you in or are you out?

54
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,620
Instead of saying, Well, no, I need more time.

55
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,560
Maybe you could say something along the lines of, well, thank you very much for this offer.

56
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,200
That's very generous and I'm very excited potentially working with your company.

57
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,480
However, this is a big family decision and I'm looking to work at a company for many years, so I would

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,690
like to discuss this with my wife or my partner and have some time to make sure that this is something

59
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,250
we are both comfortable with.

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,360
And you see what I did here?

61
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,990
I just asked for more time or to not give an answer right away, perhaps over the phone, and instead

62
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,370
speak to my partner.

63
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,580
And all I did was give reason why I'm doing things.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,240
I'm not being selfish.

65
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,560
I don't want more time, just strictly for myself.

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,570
This is something that I'm doing because I have somebody else that is involved in the decision.

67
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,390
And by giving a reason like that as an interviewer, that makes sense, right?

68
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,220
I mean, the interviewer will be doing the same in your shoes.

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,430
Let's talk about the next point.

70
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,090
Always negotiate.

71
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,810
I cannot emphasize this enough.

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,330
You see, negotiation is is quite difficult and it is uncomfortable for most, most people.

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,860
Actually, I've never met somebody that just loves negotiating.

74
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,990
Maybe one or two.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,230
But negotiating is very tricky because it is very different between social dynamics and cultures and

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,190
demographics.

77
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,340
Appropriate advice for somebody in North America who's a white male, maybe different than somebody

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,830
in a completely different location.

79
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,780
There are so many factors at play here and you know your culture best.

80
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,820
But at the same time, don't use that as a reason to not negotiate.

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,240
Being able to negotiate is present in all cultures, and you got to keep that in mind.

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:10,550
You're never going to damage a relationship or have an offer revoked just by negotiating.

83
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,920
I've never heard of anybody doing that or a company saying, No, no, no, we're taking the offer off

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,630
the table because you're negotiating.

85
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,460
So always negotiate.

86
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,520
If you never ask, the answer is always no.

87
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,070
And the larger the company, usually the more room they have to negotiate.

88
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,050
I actually have a friend who works at a company where the same two developers that have the same job

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,800
description, the same responsibilities have a difference of 60,000 salary difference.

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,280
One negotiated when they got hired.

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,450
The other one didn't.

92
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,490
And the other one is going to get raises and is going to increase, but it's going to take a lot longer

93
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,040
for them to make up that $60,000 difference.

94
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,260
Another point, and this is a very important one, is be positive.

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,060
You have to realize that.

96
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,660
Negotiating doesn't mean being mean.

97
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,380
It's the exact opposite.

98
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,680
You want to explore the situations that are available to you, and negotiations are win win situations.

99
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,420
If you go into a negotiation thinking that you have to screw over the other person or there's always

100
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,700
one person that wins and one person that loses.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,790
That's not a good way to negotiate.

102
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,800
Negotiation is finding a balance between what two people want.

103
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,240
And then finally.

104
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,080
When negotiating, you have to have stakes.

105
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,590
What does that mean?

106
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,770
No, that doesn't mean delicious meat.

107
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,820
Steaks means you have to have something on the line if there's no risk.

108
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:55,480
And you knew for sure that the other side would sign a contract or accept the salary, then what incentive

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,250
do they have to offer you more?

110
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,730
If they know that you're desperate and this is the only job that you can get, well, there's zero chance

111
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,650
of you negotiating with them.

112
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,130
Your alternatives is what stakes are.

113
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,150
By showing companies that you have other options.

114
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,140
Maybe you have multiple offers or another company that wants to hire you.

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,620
You allow the person across the table who's negotiating with you to know that you're willing to walk

116
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,720
away from the table without a deal.

117
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,050
And that gives you a lot of power.

118
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,580
So the best thing to allow you to negotiate is to have other options.

119
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,290
You see, recruiters are always willing to negotiate if they want you.

120
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,290
Especially when they have a chance to lose you.

121
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,960
Nothing makes a recruiter more angry or nervous than losing to a competitor company.

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,070
And that's why you'll see people that have job offers from a big company like Amazon or Google that

123
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:59,140
are able to get hired really easily at other companies like Microsoft, because those companies are

124
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,760
competing with each other for some of the top developers or engineers.

125
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,030
And if one wants a candidate, it means it's good enough for the other.

126
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,980
And before I finish this video, I want to give another example of something that happened to me.

127
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,830
I once got contacted by a book publisher and they wanted me to co-author a book.

128
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,270
And initially they offered to pay a certain amount upfront before the book got published.

129
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,730
And then I would get a percentage of the royalties instead of just accepting the offer.

130
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:40,510
I messaged back and said that I'm very thankful for the opportunity and it sounds fantastic.

131
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,890
However, based on the scope, time and research that will take to write this book, I would like to

132
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,890
discuss a higher upfront payment.

133
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
I was very positive.

134
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,820
I also told them that my time is valuable.

135
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,330
So I show them stakes, that this is something that if I do it, it will take away from my other projects.

136
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,380
I negotiated by telling them that I would like to ask for more.

137
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,040
I gave a reason to the fact of why it deserves more upfront payment.

138
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,770
And I kept the conversation going.

139
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,880
And because of that, they came back with a higher upfront payment just by sending one email.

140
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,600
But now let's talk about more detail.

141
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,800
Things such as handling offers and getting raises using these techniques that we discussed.

142
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,030
We're going to go into the next couple of videos and see how we can apply this to real life situations.

143
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll see you in that one.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,510
Bye bye.
