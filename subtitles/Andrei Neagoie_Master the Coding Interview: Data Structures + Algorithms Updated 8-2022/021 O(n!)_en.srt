00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,190
Let's quickly talk about a big old notation that you're most likely not going to encounter.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,920
And if you're writing any code that has this big notation, you're definitely doing something wrong.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,930
It's the most expensive one.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,850
It's the steepest of them all.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,950
And this is called factorial time or as I like to call it, the.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,850
Oh, no.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,930
We're not even going to do a demonstration on this because you're just not going to encounter it.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:36,010
I just want to show you that it exists with O and factorial, and this is a mathematical notation with

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,880
the exclamation mark.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,400
You can search for it and see how it works underneath the hood.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,270
But with this, it means that we're adding a nested loop for every input that we have.

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,190
Yeah.

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,350
That sounds pretty terrible, doesn't it?

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,900
Again, just to keep in mind and to get this out of the way on factorial.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,490
Probably never going to see it, but it's still it's there and it kind of looks cool.

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,099
So we can cross another one off our cheat sheet.

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,810
On factorial, you're adding a loop for every element that you're iterating over.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,230
Yeah, it's an expensive one we're not going to see in much.

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,730
So I'll see you in the next video.

20
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,510
Bye bye.
