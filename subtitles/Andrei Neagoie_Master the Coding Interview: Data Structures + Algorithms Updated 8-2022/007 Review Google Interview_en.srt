Hello.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,610
I know, I know, I know.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,340
The last two videos were kind of long, very technical.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,480
If you weren't familiar with JavaScript, maybe they were a little bit tougher.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,150
But the point was the process of solving a problem in a coding interview.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,140
And over here, I've created a little playground for you.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,530
You remember the Google interview video that I made you watch?

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,240
Well, I've implemented the solution that the interviewee created.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,490
In here we have the naive solution, which is the nested for loops, and then a better solution that

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,420
uses just one for loop at the expense of creating something in JavaScript called New Set.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,480
I left this here for you, for you to play around with and if you want to code it in your own language.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,030
But I wanted to challenge you to see if you can implement this on your own, just like the person in

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:04,800
the Google interview did in your own language, the naive approach and then the better approach and

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,950
try to follow these steps as you code along, even though you already know the answer, even though

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:20,430
you have watched the interview video by practicing the steps and how you go from the naive to the better

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,950
solution, by following the steps, you're going to improve that interviewing muscle.

17
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,790
All right.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,530
I'll see you in the next video.

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,550
Bye bye.
