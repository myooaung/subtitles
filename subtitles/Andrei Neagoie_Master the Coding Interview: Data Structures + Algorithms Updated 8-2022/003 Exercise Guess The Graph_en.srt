00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,050
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,780
We have our best friend visual go.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,620
And once again, they have a great diagram for us to play with.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:16,960
Now I'm going to give you four different graphs and you're going to have to tell me what type of graph

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,850
it is based on what we've learned so far, whether it's weighted, cyclic, undirected, directed.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,860
So let's start off with this one.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,060
What do you think this one is before I show you the answer?

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,640
Ready.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,320
All right.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,080
Well, this is an undirected.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,150
There's no arrows on weighted graph.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,860
And you can see that it's also cyclic because you can go zero one, two and back to zero.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,830
What about the next one?

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,950
What type of graph is this?

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,950
Well, this is an undirected weighted graph that's also cyclic.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,100
So you can see that we have weights on the edges here.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,140
There's no arrows.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,390
We can go anywhere we want back and forth.

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,390
And we can also make cycles.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,560
What about this one?

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:26,200
This is a directed graph, but unweighted and yes, even six and seven are a graph.

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,190
But we see here that it's not cyclic.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,630
It's a cyclic because there's no way for me to go back.

24
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,280
Let's say 0 to 1.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,690
I can't go back to zero.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,670
All right.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,390
Last one.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,290
What about this one?

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,130
This is a directed weighted graph.

30
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,790
We have the weights, has direction and when it comes to cyclic note, there are no cycles.

31
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,050
So it's a cyclic.

32
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,100
All right.

33
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,330
The final challenge.

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,610
What type of graph is this?

35
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,710
Ready for the answer.

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,330
This is a directed acyclic graph.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,860
There's no cycles.

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,080
It's directed and it's a graph.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:22,550
And this directed acyclic graph is quite common in called DAG and actually a project like Iota which

40
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,540
is a pretty popular blockchain project, uses this and uses fancy words like directed acyclic graph.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,230
But at the end of the day, that's not that impressive anymore, right?

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,330
We know what that is, just simply a graph that goes in one direction.

43
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,290
I think it's time for us to learn how to build our own graph.

44
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,790
I'll see you in the next one.

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,810
Bye bye.
