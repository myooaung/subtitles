1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,370
Whoo!

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,880
We're done with this section.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,640
Now let's review what we've learned.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,330
And before I do that, I'm going to tell you something that is counterintuitive.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,600
Don't apply to 1000 positions online.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,030
Just sending out your resume everywhere.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,220
That's what most people do.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,720
Instead, pick 5 to 10 companies you want to work for and fully target and focus on applying to them.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,680
You see, that is the main goal that we started with.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,650
Increase our chances of getting an interview.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,190
All of our actions create that and a week's worth of work will set us up for future success.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,220
Setting up something like a good resume LinkedIn profile.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,930
We keep our options open as people contact us.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,190
Like I said at the beginning of this section, most of this should take you a week to set up as you

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,100
go on and you may get feedback.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,790
You can keep updating things.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,420
The only thing that may take you longer is perhaps 1 to 2 big projects for your portfolio.

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,300
But that is a good investment because not only are you learning how to build things, but it will give

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,340
you things to talk about in the interview and you're actually coding instead of just typing up a resume

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,840
that doesn't really help you as a developer or an engineer.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,890
We talked about email and contacting people directly and getting referrals as a better way to apply

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,810
than being completely anonymous.

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,200
We talked about how to overcome the lack of experience when you're ready to apply.

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,140
The short answer was now and where you can find jobs and the most efficient way to apply.

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,210
If you've noticed, the focus is on quality over quality.

26
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,030
Even though I said it's a numbers game, your time is better invested in focusing your approach.

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,980
All right, all right, that's enough.

28
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,000
I apologize for this section.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,460
I know it's not the most exciting section.

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,590
It's really hard to make resumes exciting as a topic, but we're going to get to the actual fun coding

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,400
technical bar now, so thanks for sticking with me.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,990
It's going to get a lot more fun and I'll see you in the next section.

33
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,160
Bye bye.
