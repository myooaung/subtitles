1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,280
All right.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,170
And that's it for the interviewing and the non technical questions.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,960
I know it's not the most exciting section.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,340
It's a lot of me just talking, but I hope you see a pattern here.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,030
Once you learn this, it becomes easy because you can use this technique over and over and over throughout

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,100
your career at whatever interviews you want.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,460
That's the beauty of non technical questions.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,410
They're generally the same and they'll stay the same for many more years to come.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,200
So once you become good at them, then you're all set.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,340
But let's just do a quick review of what we've learned.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,140
We first learned that you want to have a good mindset when going into an interview.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,870
You want to be confident, you want to be relaxed.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,900
You also want to realize you're using the interviewers time, so don't make this a boring meeting for

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,260
them.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,920
Bring the energy and have a two way conversation with them.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,240
They don't want to be sitting with a scared, worried, timid interviewer with low energy that is quiet.

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,420
Have conversation.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,030
Be human.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,890
Don't be a robot and and interact with the interviewer.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,010
In psychology, there's something called primacy effect.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,270
And that is we remember the first and last impressions best.

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,220
So when you enter the room, be energetic, be excited, make a good impression.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:28,300
And when you leave the interview in the final minutes, also end on a strong note, have a strong closing

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,190
argument of why they should hire you.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:38,080
And keep in mind that we always want to have our four heroes stories that include these four heroes

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,280
in our answers, because this is what interviewers are looking for.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,500
And keep in mind, just because you feel like you're having a bad interview, it doesn't necessarily

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,240
mean that you're not going to get the job.

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,340
You're not competing against the right answer.

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,770
You're competing against other candidates who may struggle throughout the interview, just like you.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,150
I also want to show you a neat little tool that may come in handy for you.

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,560
This is a website that we're going to talk about in the offering negotiation section.

33
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:14,740
Glassdoor and Glassdoor is allow you to look at companies, what employers are saying about them, but

34
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,800
they also have a new interviews section where you can actually search a company and see what sort of

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,060
interviews they ask.

36
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,960
So you can use this as a way to prepare and practice if the company is listed on this website.

37
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:39,500
You see in life, success comes to those who are able to stand out and do the extra step that 99% of

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,360
the people aren't willing to do.

39
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,170
It's why you're taking the course.

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,560
Most people don't practice for interviews.

41
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:54,350
If we look at this in this way, we notice a big factor when interviewing on top of working on coding

42
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,430
questions, data structures and algorithms that we cover in this course.

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,350
You should also work on parts that don't often get attention from people.

44
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,290
These are the non technical questions where people want to find out whether you can speak to people

45
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,010
on your team.

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,850
You can communicate with clients and customers and coworkers, whether you're able to focus on prioritizing

47
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,900
tasks and not getting stuck solving a problem, whether you need hand-holding or you're able to be independent

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,360
and solve problems on your own.

49
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:33,890
Because at the end, interview process asks one big question If I hire you, will you make my life easier?

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,030
That's it.

51
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,530
If you're able to make somebody's life easier and offer a big value, then you're going to be hired.

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,070
People want to hire developers and programmers that will help their business grow and saves them time.

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,190
So be that candidate and be that person.

54
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,310
I'll see you in the next section.
