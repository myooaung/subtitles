1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,810
Everyone's favorite topic, the resume.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,230
I doubt, though, many people actually enjoy writing their resume, but unfortunately it is a required

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,560
part of a job search.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,310
Well, actually, in a later video, I'll argue that this is not the case.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,420
But for now, let's leave it at that.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,630
In order to maximize your chances of getting an interview, you will most likely need a resume.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:33,340
A brief document that someone will glance over it about 10 seconds and decide if you are worth talking

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,370
to for a potential interview or phone interview.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,030
How can we increase the odds here now?

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,790
Resumes are a bane to everyone's existence.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:50,140
Nobody likes writing them, and no employer offers a job just because of somebody's resume.

12
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,600
So you need to treat it accordingly.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,750
Resumes are simply a way to get interviews.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,550
And again, you'll see soon that it's not the only way.

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,100
Spend very little amount of time on your resume.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,599
No longer than a day.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,300
Look at the types of jobs that you want to have and have the words and characteristics described in

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,120
those job postings on your resume.

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:19,840
Finally, make it personal for each position you apply to so that employers names is on the resume.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:26,290
It will take you 10 seconds, but by doing just those things, it already puts you above most people

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,590
that just send mass amount of resumes that look the same.

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,990
Now, before we get into the details of how to make a resume look good, I want to show you a really

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,680
nice tool.

24
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:45,170
This is the resume maker online, a free tool that just creates a resume for you or it gives you a nice

25
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,720
design and a template that you can just fill out yourself.

26
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,060
There are others like it online, so you shouldn't really format your own resume.

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,850
I mean, you're a programmer.

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,080
You're a developer.

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:04,120
You should spend your time coding and use the skills that other people have in design to improve your

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,590
resume.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,150
So unless you're a designer, you don't really need to focus on making your resume visually appealing,

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,340
and you can just use a template like this one.

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,190
Most of your time, like I said, is better spent on other things.

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,770
And again, remember what I said.

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,960
In most cases, resumes get viewed for only 10 seconds by a recruiter, and they'll decide quickly if

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,590
they should contact you for an in-person interview or a phone interview.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,320
Most people spend too much time on their resumes, tweaking small things, changing fonts, and, well,

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,390
it's just a waste of time.

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,570
Once you have a good resume that returns a good result, then you're all set.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Ancient stress about it.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,990
And keep in mind that some companies that get a lot of resumes don't even have humans actually looking

42
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,830
at the resume.

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,700
And initially they have some sort of an algorithm search that looks for keywords on your resume based

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,900
on their job description.

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,030
So let's go back to the slides.

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,970
Now, I'm going to give you a cheat sheet in the next video and do a bit of an exercise that goes into

47
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,290
a little bit more detail.

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,880
But for now, let's follow these key points for having a nice resume.

49
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,310
Resumes should be one page only.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,320
And unless you're an executive or something like that, you won't need more than a page.

51
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,150
Second, make sure that your resume contains relevant skills.

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,680
Each job has a specific requirement, and they're looking for specific skills.

53
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,120
These form great keywords to use in your resume.

54
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,670
You can highlight the relevant skills in your professional summary that enables the employer to quickly

55
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,170
get a grasp of the most impressive and important things in your profile.

56
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,170
So again, try to use the keywords that they use in the job description in your resume.

57
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,870
Thirdly, you want to make it look personal like you didn't just mass email a bunch of companies.

58
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,790
And one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to use the same resume for each job application.

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,350
That doesn't mean making your resume handcrafted each time, spending hours for each company, because

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,450
most of the time your resume will look the same.

61
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,640
It's very easy to customize a resume, though, maybe changing a headline or a summary section at the

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,750
top where you can convey in a sentence how you would fit well with the company, or even just mention

63
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,060
the particular company you're applying for.

64
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,010
And then finally, you want to have some sort of an online link.

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,140
You want to highlight perhaps your GitHub, your blog posts, portfolio websites.

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,480
As a developer, you should have something that is present online for you to showcase to an employer.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,000
As a matter of fact, that is more impressive than a resume.

68
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,500
And this is something we'll talk about later in this section.

69
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,560
But that should be clearly highlighted on your resume.

70
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:48,960
All right.

71
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,920
These are just bullet points, and it's kind of hard to explain this without actually showing you a

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,430
demo.

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,770
So it's time for a little exercise.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
I have a little resume cheat sheet for you.

75
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,010
And in the next video, I'm going to show you an example of a bad resume.

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,740
Then use the checklist to see how we can improve it.

77
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,910
I'll see you in that one.

78
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,870
Bye bye.
