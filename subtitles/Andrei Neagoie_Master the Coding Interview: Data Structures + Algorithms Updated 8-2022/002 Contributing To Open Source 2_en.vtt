00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.990
We've just done our first contribution, which wasn't that crazy, right?

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.030
We just went to the start here guideline and added our names to the contributors list.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.650
But let's actually contribute to an open source project now.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
Now, in our community, every month we do coding challenges.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.260
Now you can search for coding challenges here, but this month is a special event because we're actually

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.980
doing.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.400
A October fest event.

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.270
And this happens once a year in our community in October.

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.100
And you can see that if we click on the October 1st 2019 link.

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
So depending on when you watch this, you might have a different ear.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.500
You see that we've provided for you an opportunity to contribute to an open source project.

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.470
We actually have Animation Nation.

14
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.830
We have a Santa fied project and also a Python project.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.510
And you can contribute to any one of these.

16
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:20.240
So if we look at Animation Nation while people have contributed their CSS animations here, ooh, this

17
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.140
one looks nice.

18
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.770
We also have the Santa fied project.

19
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
So people have created a little Santa website.

20
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.870
That's kind of nice.

21
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.750
Very, very cool.

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.920
And then we also have the Python art project that actually does something really cool.

23
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.020
If I go to the website here.

24
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.330
They'll actually turn an image into ASCII art, which is really, really cool.

25
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.760
Now there's tons of projects that you can do, but let's try and do this Animation Nation project.

26
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.250
So the first thing I'm going to do is go to the project repository.

27
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.229
And follow the steps that we've done before.

28
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.080
That is, we fork the repository.

29
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.740
We now clone this repository.

30
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.470
Let's get clone.

31
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.530
And while that is being cloned, let's look at the instructions.

32
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.230
Now most open source projects will have instructions on how you can contribute.

33
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.770
In our case, we have a nice step by step guide.

34
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.080
So in the art directory, create a directory name after yourself.

35
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.330
Okay, that's nice and easy to do.

36
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.860
So let's seed into the animation.

37
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.480
Nation project.

38
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.380
Let's open it up and sublime.

39
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.870
And we see that there's an art folder and in here we have to create our own name or our own folder with

40
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.470
our name.

41
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.510
I've actually already created a folder called Animate Tron.

42
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.570
That has.

43
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.720
A little CSR project with index HTML and CSS.

44
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.840
So just to show you, let's move this.

45
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.300
Or just to show you.

46
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.580
This is my little animation using some simple index, HTML and CSS.

47
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.850
Nothing too crazy.

48
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.030
Now, all we need to do is move this into the art folder as the instructions have given us.

49
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.580
And now we've added our project.

50
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.620
Let's see where it's animatronic.

51
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.910
There it is.

52
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.650
That's my project over there.

53
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.450
Next.

54
00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.440
Is to well within this folder make sure we create two files, an HTML file and a CSS file and link the

55
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.600
CSS file to your HTML.

56
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.970
Using only HTML and CSS create a work of art.

57
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.820
So I've actually already done that.

58
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.080
Again, if we go back to the project, I have an index HTML file.

59
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.380
Very, very simple that's linked to a stylesheet.

60
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.260
And this is my styles that I've added for my animation that.

61
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.600
These little lines.

62
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.230
Now, the last part here is to add my own card to the section, to the include DOJ's file.

63
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.140
So let's just copy this.

64
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.890
Go to the.

65
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.370
Includes.

66
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.100
Or include dogs.

67
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.380
And you see, this is where everybody enters their information.

68
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:58.920
And right here we can just add what we copy and paste it, make sure the indentation is proper.

69
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.750
So the our name is going to be called animate Tron.

70
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.860
Page link is going to be well the name of our folder.

71
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.480
So I name a Tron.

72
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.320
Index html.

73
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.190
And then the gift name which.

74
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.520
They suggested that we include a gif.

75
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.400
So if I remember correctly, the.

76
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.310
GIF name.

77
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.560
Was Transport gif.

78
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.930
Again, I just created a little gif of my animation, so we'll call it transport gif.

79
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.910
Author is.

80
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.980
Andre and the GitHub link is my GitHub link.

81
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.170
All right, so that should be good.

82
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.580
Let's now make a pull request.

83
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.980
Now, notice here how I did all these changes on Master.

84
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.840
Ideally, we created these changes on a new branch, so we can actually just do that.

85
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.620
Now get.

86
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.210
Check out, be.

87
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.490
And call it animatronic.

88
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.940
So if I do get status now.

89
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.110
I see that I have to changes.

90
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.840
That's good.

91
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.900
Let's do get add.

92
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.880
Get commit.

93
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.740
Adding my artsy ness to the project.

94
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.300
And then finally get Push Origin and I'm Ultron.

95
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.820
All right.

96
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.180
If we go back to the project.

97
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.910
We see that we actually now have a little icon that says compare, pull, request.

98
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.850
If I go back to the forked repo.

99
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.020
Zero to mastery.

100
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.030
You see right over here that I also have this yellow banner.

101
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.980
So if I click on this.

102
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.900
And say.

103
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.640
Please add me to this list and we'll link to.

104
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.480
This is Joy, who's one of the managers.

105
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.810
So I'm just going to say, please add me to the list.

106
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.080
We actually don't even need to tag her because she will check this occasionally.

107
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.660
So I'm going to create a pull request.

108
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.710
It's now opened.

109
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.910
That's awesome.

110
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.020
So please add me to the list if I look at my file changes.

111
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.040
You can see that these are what I've added to the project.

112
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.670
So if I now merge pull request again, you won't be able to do this.

113
00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.670
But some of our management team people who are managing the open source projects will be able to merge

114
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.420
for you.

115
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.220
We can delete the branch since we have merged everything.

116
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.310
And now let's see if the changes have been made.

117
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.190
If I go to the Zero to Mastery Animation Nation, so if I now look for my project.

118
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.210
Hey, look at that.

119
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.720
There's my little animatronic project that.

120
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.810
Well, there it is.

121
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.110
There's my kiss.

122
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.330
That's beautiful.

123
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:38.789
The way this project is designed, it randomly selects the course animation, so it might not show all

124
00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:39.870
of them at the same time.

125
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:46.320
So you might have to refresh this a few times, but just like that, I made my open source contribution.

126
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.600
Now there's a ton of projects here that you can join.

127
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:59.160
And like I said, this is a playground for you to test, make mistakes, because this isn't a real workplace.

128
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.540
We want to practice these skills before we actually go into work and make big, dangerous changes.

129
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.810
And that's open source.

130
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.700
I highly, highly recommend that you get involved.

131
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.630
It's a great way to work with others.

132
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.080
It's a great way to learn how Git and GitHub really work.

133
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.850
There's no doubt that there's a lot that an individual programmer can do.

134
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:28.590
However, the progress and scale that something can be built is really compounded when many people work

135
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.850
on something together.

136
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.780
Go make your first open source contribution and have fun building things with your fellow programmers.

137
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.450
It may one day lead you to impress a potential employer.

138
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.070
See you in the next one.
