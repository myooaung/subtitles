00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,430
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,830
I want to show you one of my favorite coding challenges that happens every year.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,690
Every Christmas in December, there's something called advent of code.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,750
And if you Google advent of code, you'll see that, well, the 2017 version comes.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,250
But based on when you're watching the video, there will be the 2018 version.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,760
But you can also go back in time and do the previous years.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,409
If I go to 2016, we see our 2016 version.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,110
Now as a community, our zero to Mastery community on Discord.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:46,090
Every December we tackle this challenge and try to solve coding problems for 25 days straight.

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,470
And these are, in my opinion, some of the best logical problems they can solve with code.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,120
They're really, really good.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
And they get harder and harder each day.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,110
But the fun thing is that you'll have a community of people to do it with.

14
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,700
And as you can see here, there's subreddits, there's hacker news communities that work together and

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,800
our own community where we compare each other's code, see who came up with what solution.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,370
So I encourage you to do this even if it is in December, but get ready because in December we're going

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,180
to be doing this challenge together every December as a community.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,250
Happy advent of code.
