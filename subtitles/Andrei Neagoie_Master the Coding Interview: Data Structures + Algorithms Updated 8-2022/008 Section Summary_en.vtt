00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.720
Well done.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.740
You just finished another section and congratulations.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.580
Someone finds your skills valuable.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.970
And this is the fun part, right?

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.280
Offers and negotiations.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.450
Being able to handle those properly.

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.480
It's something that most people don't really think about because they're so focused on getting a job

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
that when they actually receive an offer or they're on the job.

9
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.890
They're not really prepared to handle negotiation, handle salaries, handle offers, which let's be

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.910
honest, you get these throughout your life, throughout your career, you're going to have to handle

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.900
these situations.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.960
And it's one of the best things you can do in terms of investment is being prepared for these.

13
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.520
So I hope this section taught you how to handle rejection, how to handle offers, how to handle multiple

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.600
offers, some basic tips on negotiation, and how to get a raise and ask for a raise.

15
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.260
At the end of the day, we worked so hard to get here.

16
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:15.170
The easiest part is this where we're able to set ourselves up for the rest of the year, the rest of

17
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.790
our career at a company in a way that we're happy and satisfied with our job, with our salaries, and

18
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.630
with our benefits.

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.570
But there's one overall theme in all of this, and that is you want to treat people well.

20
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.030
You don't want to create enemies.

21
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.570
And if you do it properly, you won't be a nice person.

22
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.750
Be positive.

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.270
Don't burn bridges.

24
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.530
Negotiation and asking for salary isn't going to create enemies.

25
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.580
It's just two parties having a conversation to meet in the middle and both be happy.

26
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.210
And just like a muscle, just like we train our coding skills.

27
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.040
Practicing, negotiating, practicing how to handle offers is a muscle that you can train.

28
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.030
So go out there and negotiate your next raise.

29
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.120
I'll see you in the next one.

30
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.139
Bye bye.
