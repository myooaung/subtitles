00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,050
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,270
I want to take a quick break here.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,220
Go grab a coffee, grab a tea.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,160
Just take a break from all the learning that you just did.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,050
And I want to talk to you quickly about imposter syndrome.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,130
It's this idea that you're not good enough, that things are too complicated for you to ever achieve

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,540
what you want to achieve.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,240
You look at other people, at other industry experts, and you say, I will never get there.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,470
But it's just a symptom of learning.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:38,070
This idea of you not being good enough simply means that, well, you're just not there yet.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,340
Things take time if you want to learn a valuable skill.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,290
Well, it's hard work.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,700
That's why it's valuable.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,020
Remember how you felt on the first day of going to school?

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,970
First day on a job?

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,100
It's the same experience.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,850
But over time, with repetition, with practice, you get comfortable, you get experience, and you

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,490
slowly start to lose that imposter syndrome.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,940
Now, this idea of an imposter syndrome is great.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,800
It means you're doing something worthwhile.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,710
So don't use it as a negative.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,760
Use it as an encouragement that you're doing something good, that you're learning, and you're stretching

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,510
your limits.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,710
So with this break, I want to propose that we do a quick exercise.

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,970
I want you to stop the lectures again, grab a coffee, grab a tea, and head on over to our discord.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
Now, in our Discord server, if you've used it up until now, that's great.

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,720
If you haven't.

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,710
Head on over to this server and I want you to do something that I think is super important to learning

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,280
and that is using what you've learned up until now to actually teach someone or help someone so you

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,640
can go all the way to, let's say, the coding and courses section and pick a topic that you want to

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,410
help somebody in.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,600
So let's say you go to the Python channel and in here you'll have other students that are asking Python

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,650
related questions.

34
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,080
Now you can scroll through here and see if you're able to help someone, even though you may not have

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,000
the experience or the knowledge yet.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,840
This idea of practicing and explaining what you've just learned to other people, even if you're not

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,230
100% certain, actually is beneficial to your learning.

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,290
Because if you're never teaching, if you're never explaining and vocalizing and showing what you've

39
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,230
learned, you'll always be a beginner.

40
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,700
This idea of teaching what you learn is a very important concept.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,640
So moving forward, as you go through the lectures, any time you feel like taking a break, hop on

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,340
over to Discord and help somebody.

43
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,160
Our motto here is that we're always kind.

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,450
We don't judge anybody.

45
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,280
We're all just beginners here.

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,270
We're all learning.

47
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,630
So don't be afraid to answer things because you've got to remember, nobody's perfect except for Yoda.

48
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,250
Yoda is pretty perfect.

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,410
All right, I'll see you in the next one.

50
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:55,890
Bye bye.
