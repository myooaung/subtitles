00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:11,010
Welcome to our last section on algorithms, the last missing piece, and that is dynamic programming.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,960
Sounds very important, doesn't it?

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:24,350
With this section, we're going to go over the very last piece of our mind map to complete our entire

4
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,040
knowledge graph.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,780
So we're ready for interviews.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,400
It's this last little piece of dynamic programming, specifically memorization, that we're going to

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,270
be talking about.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,070
But what is it?

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,040
Dynamic programming is just an optimization technique.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,380
And here's the fun fact.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,820
Dynamic programming actually means nothing.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
It's completely garbage buzzword.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,020
And I'm not kidding.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,080
Here, I'll link to a funny article on how the name came to be, but dynamic programming at the end

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,030
of the day is just an optimization technique using something called caching.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,820
If you have something that you can cash, well, then you can use dynamic programming.

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,940
Now we're going to get into the details of what that means throughout the next videos.

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:27,040
But at a high level, dynamic programming is a way to solve problems by breaking it down into a collection

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,290
of SOP problems, solving each of those problems just once, and storing their solutions in case next

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,590
time the same sub problem occurs.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,510
But let's get into that and understand what it means, how we can implement it to become better interviewers,

22
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,030
better engineers and better programmers.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll see you in the next video.

24
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,890
Bye bye.
