00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:09.120
Do you have any question for me or for us a question that always gets asked at the end of the interview.

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.400
Once again, we should be prepared.

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.110
What should we ask them?

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.730
As always, the key here is to stand out.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.990
You want to make sure that these questions demonstrate how you're really interested in the company and

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.100
how you've thought well about why you want to work here.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.440
The key points here are to focus on the interviewer.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.380
So use the word you, not I.

9
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.990
You can perhaps say I had a really good time at this interview.

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.170
I do have a few questions for you and then direct that attention to them, because interviewers are

11
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.890
humans too.

12
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.740
And as humans we like talking about ourself.

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.850
If throughout the entire interview, all they did was ask questions and all you did was answer questions.

14
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.100
They're probably bored out of their mind, or at least not having as much time as if they were also

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.760
got a chance to talk about themselves.

16
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.459
So use that to your advantage.

17
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.800
And ideally, if you're able to mention something that they mentioned throughout the interview, that

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.210
also shows that you're paying attention and that you care, which is a big bonus.

19
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.450
Listen to what they say about themselves at the beginning or during the interview and bring it up later

20
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.830
in the interview towards the end so that the question is tailored to them.

21
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.290
Use their name and use what you know about them to ask a specific question.

22
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.540
What are some of these questions that you should ask?

23
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.400
Here are a couple lists of questions that I personally really like and I think are good questions to

24
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.700
ask.

25
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.500
And you only need to ask maybe one, two or three questions, but you can pick your favorite.

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.270
So here goes a couple of these.

27
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.690
One.

28
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.100
What is the greatest mistake you made in the first month of the job and what did you do?

29
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.600
Again, you're interviewing them, but this allows them to talk about themselves.

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.590
The second one.

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.570
Where do you see this company going in the next three years?

32
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.070
Next five years?

33
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.310
I want to be here for a while.

34
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.550
But you work here and you have better knowledge of the company than I do, and I would like to see where

35
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.720
the company is headed.

36
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.220
Again, a great question to show that you want to be here long term, but you also get to find out about

37
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.780
long term plans of the company.

38
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.470
Why did you join this company again?

39
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.750
Ask them why they're here.

40
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.440
Have you seen your skills grow in the past year?

41
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.480
Another question.

42
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:42.040
Is to perhaps ask them the one time that they messed up at the job and how it was handled by the company.

43
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.910
And then finally, my favorite question, what they wish somebody told them when they just started the

44
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.990
job of this company.

45
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.630
That way they get to talk about their experience.

46
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.010
And that way you also get to find out how the first week of the job will be.

47
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.170
Now all these questions are targeted towards the interviewer, but it shows that you actually care and

48
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.080
that you have genuine questions and you're not just here to land a job to make money.

49
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.190
And that's it.

50
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.980
Again, it makes you more human, less of a robot.

51
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.030
It's really going to create a better bond with your interviewer.

52
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.530
I'll see you in the next video.

53
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.640
Bye bye.
