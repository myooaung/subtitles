00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.270
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.620
Were you able to implement Prevent?

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.470
Let's have a look at what the code should look like.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:17.080
The very first thing we do, just like we did with a pen, is to create the node that we're going to

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.530
add.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.400
So I'm going to say new node value.

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.010
And next now next year, I'm going to leave as no.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.900
And I'll show you why in the next video that is the case and we don't just have next equals to this

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.570
dot head to reference the very first item in our list which is ten.

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.360
But for now, just trust me that this we want to leave us know because we can do that later.

11
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.100
Right now we're just creating an empty node with the value.

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.950
Next.

13
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.720
We want to say that our new node.

14
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.940
Dot next, which is this value over here.

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.310
Is going to equal this dot head.

16
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.740
So we've just created a pointer saying that the new node we just created is going to point to this dot

17
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.370
head.

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.870
The very first item in our list that shouldn't make sense.

19
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.320
And then obviously, just like we did with a pen, we want to update the reference now to say that this

20
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.310
dot head is no longer equal to this old value.

21
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.020
It's now the new node.

22
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.900
And then finally, we want to add this length and make sure we increase the length of our list.

23
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.100
Finally, if we return this hour linked list, we can say run.

24
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.750
And look at that.

25
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.090
We've presented one to the very first item.

26
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.840
On the list.

27
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.640
The head and that is now referencing ten.

28
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.100
And the tale of our list is now 16.

29
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.400
That wasn't too bad, was it?

30
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.780
In the next video I want to talk about quickly about this new node code that we're repeating both in

31
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.980
append and prevent and what we might want to do with it.

32
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.720
I'll see you in that one.
