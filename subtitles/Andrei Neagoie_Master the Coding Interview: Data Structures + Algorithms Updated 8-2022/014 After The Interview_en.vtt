00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.270
Oh, you just finish the interview.

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.620
It's all over.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
All that preparation, all that work that went into it, it's finally done.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.480
These are the final seconds of the interview.

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.410
What do you do?

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.810
Well, first off, you want to thank your recruiter or the interviewer and you want to sound excited.

7
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.410
Hopefully this won't be hard.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.030
You're actually excited about the job, but you made a good first impression when you walked into the

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.420
door.

10
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.920
And you also want to end on a good impression at the end to be very positive, be very energetic, and

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.150
thank them for their time.

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.990
If you're able to, you can also ask for specific feedback on your interview performance.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.450
Usually they won't say, but that never hurts to ask either.

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.170
And you also want to ask them when you should expect to hear back from them so that you have some sort

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.920
of a timeline of when the decision is going to be made, whether to give you the job or to do another

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.460
interview.

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.360
Now, at the end of the interview, I like to prepare something called a closing statement.

18
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.730
Most people get intimidated by interviews and especially technical ones.

19
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.430
However, the first and last impression are what most interviewers remember.

20
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.130
So at the end of the interview, no matter how well the interview has gone, whether you think you're

21
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.950
not going to get the job or whether you aced it, you want to conclude with something that touches on

22
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.180
all of these points.

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.120
That is, you want to make a statement that doesn't use the word AI so you don't keep talking about

24
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.810
yourself.

25
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.360
You want to talk about the interviewer, you want to express how you're the ideal candidate, the best

26
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.290
candidate for the job, but doing so without bragging.

27
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.790
So what does that mean?

28
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.620
Here's an example of what I would say if it was the end of the interview and I want to essentially end

29
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.420
off the interview on a good note.

30
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.590
Thank you for your time.

31
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.850
I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I want to say one last thing.

32
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.600
There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.

33
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.140
However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless developers with ambition to learn.

34
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.680
It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong.

35
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.010
The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.

36
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.520
It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

37
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.290
I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today, but the one thing that you can

38
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.170
guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her

39
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.830
skill every day, play nicely with all the other developers at the company and isn't so narrow minded

40
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.140
and problem solving that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

41
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.460
When you hire me, you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.

42
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.340
You don't have to extinguish fires.

43
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.760
And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.

44
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.670
I can guarantee that I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can

45
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.460
grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

46
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.400
And I've chosen this company specific for that reason.

47
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.100
And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have

48
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.930
an impact and propel your career.

49
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.500
I am at the stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you.

50
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.220
So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.

51
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.480
All right.

52
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.170
That was it.

53
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.140
Now, this may sound a little intense, but who would you hire?

54
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.580
A developer that did pretty well at an interview and blends in well with all the other interviews that

55
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.570
the interviewer has done, or the developer who wanted it more than any others and really showed how

56
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.740
much they want the job.

57
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.770
Again, this depends on your personality, but the idea is that you want to finish the interview strong

58
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.720
and after the interview you want to write perhaps an email afterwards to the people that interviewed

59
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.960
you.

60
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.210
You can thank them if during the interview there are technical challenges that you weren't able to answer,

61
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.150
you can actually reply to them that you have looked at the problem and you have now found a solution.

62
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.880
And this is something that you can probably do easily by Googling.

63
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.149
But this shows that even if you didn't solve the specific problem that they had, you have taken the

64
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.070
time to actually solve it now.

65
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.810
And in this thank you email, you just don't want to sound like a robot, just nice and short.

66
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.130
Thank them for the time.

67
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.270
Show that you're interested in the position and that you look forward to the next step.

68
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.990
Now, if for some reason you haven't heard back by the time the deadline has passed, just message them

69
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.420
again and let them know that you're waiting for a reply and we'll need to make a decision soon since

70
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.090
you're interviewing at other companies, but wanted to make sure that you don't make a decision without

71
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.280
knowing the situation at this company since you really enjoyed the interview process here.

72
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.870
And this is a bit of a psychological technique that we're going to talk about in the negotiation and

73
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.740
offer section.

74
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.130
But that's a nice thing to say in case you're just waiting around for an offer, because remember,

75
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.600
the more time you wait, the more people they're going to interview.

76
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.810
So think about that.

77
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.950
All right.

78
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.080
Now it's just a waiting game.

79
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.980
Good job on the interview and hopefully everything went well.

80
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.290
I'll see you in the next one.

81
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.380
Bye bye.
