In the last lecture you got a basic introduction to components and components work pretty similar to

00:08.720 --> 00:09.740
view instances.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.750
You can also define method stair and other things.

00:12.770 --> 00:17.110
Views Chaiya supports but you can reuse them.

00:17.570 --> 00:24.740
Now it would also be interesting to be able to pass data to our own components right.

00:24.770 --> 00:29.600
And we can do this by adding a special property to our view component.

00:29.800 --> 00:36.900
I'll add it here to the top but the position doesn't matter which is called prop's now props is an array

00:37.490 --> 00:39.470
off properties.

00:39.560 --> 00:44.270
We want to make bind the bull from outside for example.

00:44.300 --> 00:48.110
That could be as a string username.

00:48.140 --> 00:52.920
This now allows me to comment out my user name here.

00:52.940 --> 00:55.690
So we could also remove the entire data function.

00:56.180 --> 01:02.720
And now we still have username you can access it just like a property defined in your data object or

01:02.720 --> 01:05.200
here in your data a function object.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.680
But now you can set it from outside.

01:08.690 --> 01:13.720
How do you set it very easy just with rebind.

01:13.850 --> 01:16.960
And then the property name username.

01:17.150 --> 01:24.300
This allows me to pass as a string Chris to the first usage of this component.

01:24.530 --> 01:31.170
And on the second one I'll simply bind and here on the string.

01:31.340 --> 01:37.830
If I now add control enter your secrets and Anna here but now and that is huge we're able to tell namak

01:37.920 --> 01:40.370
set this value from outside.
