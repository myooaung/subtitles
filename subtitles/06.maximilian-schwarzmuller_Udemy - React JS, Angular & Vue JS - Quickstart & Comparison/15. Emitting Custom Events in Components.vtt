In the last lecture we learned how we can pass data into your component.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.210
We're not limited to that though.

00:08.280 --> 00:13.280
We can also emit our own event to the outside world.

00:13.380 --> 00:19.680
So let's say that if we clicked this paragraph here we actually want to emit an event which we can handle

00:19.830 --> 00:23.760
in the U.S. instance where we use days component.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.000
Well we can simply use Villon here and then click.

00:28.260 --> 00:35.780
I told you you can use all the features you know and there you can simply call any method.

00:35.820 --> 00:42.570
So let's say user name clicked and this method of course has to be added to your component so let's

00:42.570 --> 00:47.330
add our methods object just like in a normal instance.

00:47.670 --> 00:52.140
We should name this method user name clicked because that's what we try to call.

00:52.140 --> 00:53.460
And here we can use days.

00:53.480 --> 00:59.300
And now a special function viewed as gets you dollar sign.

00:59.310 --> 01:05.160
You can tailor the functions provided by View chairs by the fact that it has a dollar sign if you use

01:05.160 --> 01:10.480
it inside of a component or instance dollar sign emit.

01:10.590 --> 01:15.800
This takes two arguments the first one is the name by which you can listen to this event.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.380
So we could named is user collect like name is totally up to you.

01:21.390 --> 01:26.410
The second argument can be any data object a string you want to pass.

01:26.460 --> 01:29.330
So here we could pass this username.

01:29.430 --> 01:32.470
Now with that we can listen to this event.

01:32.490 --> 01:37.260
Let's say here on the first component of course we can listen to it on both components I'm just splitting

01:37.260 --> 01:40.490
this over multiple lines here to make it a bit easier to read.

01:42.500 --> 01:47.730
By adding the on on our own component and now listening to our own event.

01:47.810 --> 01:53.960
So user clicked and in here we can now execute our code.

01:54.290 --> 02:04.040
So here I want to execute user was clicked and I will pass an argument dollar sign event I reserved

02:04.040 --> 02:09.570
the variable we can use here which will always hold the event data which was submitted.

02:09.620 --> 02:15.470
So Mujeres will give us this event data through this resurged variable name.

02:15.500 --> 02:19.840
Now user was clicked as a method of I of course have to ask therefore.

02:19.910 --> 02:27.800
So I will add it to my first instance here maybe below get color here I know that I get the event data

02:27.830 --> 02:31.440
and we know that the event data will be just a string right.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.900
The user name what we emit here.

02:34.550 --> 02:40.970
So therefore I know that this will just be the name and I can simply for example then alert the name

02:41.630 --> 02:45.170
if I now had control enter and click on Chris.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.790
Nothing happens.

02:46.790 --> 02:47.700
Why.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.530
Well that's something we'll have a look at in a second to make it work.

02:53.990 --> 03:04.030
We simply have to make sure that we rename our event here to user clicked lowercase and add in our template.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.990
We also listened to user clicked.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.730
Now Xvid control enter and click Chris we see that.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.400
But why did we have to make that change.
