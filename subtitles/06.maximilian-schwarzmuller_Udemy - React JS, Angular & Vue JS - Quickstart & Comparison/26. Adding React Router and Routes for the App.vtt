00:02.460 --> 00:07.290
So the last lecture we created our own component and our local setup and saw that this still worked

00:07.320 --> 00:09.050
as we learn it before.

00:09.060 --> 00:13.860
Now I want to add the reactor router to really make this a single page application.

00:13.890 --> 00:21.180
So staying on this single in this age team file but actually handling different view or else so acting

00:21.270 --> 00:24.400
like you were to do multiple pages.

00:24.540 --> 00:30.570
Now for that we need to install the reactor router and I will do this you're opening a terminal in my

00:30.630 --> 00:36.200
ideas so that's a normal terminal window and then you're navigating the project folder.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.460
I'll run and install dash dash save re-act router Dom.

00:41.460 --> 00:47.370
That's the package we need and that will add an entry to the package dodgiest and file and install this

00:47.370 --> 00:52.860
module in the node modules folder so that we can use it now to use that router.

00:52.950 --> 00:55.350
I'm going to go to my app touch js file.

00:55.380 --> 01:02.460
So into the file where I want to render some routes and want to add some links that could of course

01:02.460 --> 01:09.600
be a different file if you wanted to import a couple of things using E-6 import syntax from the re-act

01:09.600 --> 01:11.480
router Dohm package.

01:11.490 --> 01:16.560
So your what I do need and I use this index to only get some of the things dece package and this package

01:16.560 --> 01:22.590
provides I need the browser router I'll assign an alias for router so that they can just use router

01:22.590 --> 01:24.540
and use browser router.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.680
I'll need the router object and the link.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.540
Now how do we use the router here in the render Meffert.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.320
I no longer use a death here.

01:35.340 --> 01:44.520
Instead what I will do here is I will simply wrap this in my router object we need to set the history

01:44.520 --> 01:45.090
here.

01:45.150 --> 01:47.860
And it also shouldn't be self-closing.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.300
Instead this should now be my router should be closed like that now between the opening and closing

01:54.300 --> 01:54.690
tag.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.810
We can use routing features.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.310
So let's set up some routes.

01:59.430 --> 02:08.280
I will do this by adding the route component here which I imported and route is a self-closing tag where

02:08.310 --> 02:12.540
I do define the payoff like a slash for example.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.760
And then the component that I want to load the component to your however won't be a string.

02:17.820 --> 02:23.390
I will use a single Cauley braces here to reference a component but I don't have such components.

02:23.550 --> 02:26.190
So I will quickly add components here.

02:26.460 --> 02:34.170
I'll add three components an account component count the js file then maybe a block that js file and

02:34.190 --> 02:42.600
why don't we all add a user to a js file now and all these false I will simply export a default function

02:42.750 --> 02:46.370
which will be my stateless properties here.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.090
Am I state last component component's my dump components where it will simply returns.

02:51.090 --> 02:59.360
I'm js X so here in the user case I will simply wrap this in a death where I say the user page.

02:59.790 --> 03:00.900
WIPs like that.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.080
And I'm going to copy that into my blocked page here too.

03:04.200 --> 03:11.040
There I want to say the block page and I want to do that in the account page to here outside the account

03:11.040 --> 03:19.200
page and to mix it up all to take my info which right now import here in my apt or jazz file.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.940
I don't use it there anymore.

03:21.030 --> 03:26.040
All now Broder's import into my user dot js file of course.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.300
Need to adjust it because I'm already in the components folder.

03:29.560 --> 03:36.000
I don't want to use info in there so that is all these are all the components I want to use.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.200
Now back to the chapter jr's fault.

03:38.250 --> 03:45.390
I cannot sign them here and forward it at first day to import them so I will import user from dot slash

03:45.390 --> 03:53.940
components slash user and I will replicate this to also get the account and to also get the blog.

03:54.270 --> 04:00.450
With that I got all the components I want to set up as routes so my route route could be the user component

04:00.520 --> 04:08.570
and I assigned like dis just referencing does component name and I will then replicate this to all a

04:08.580 --> 04:14.190
set up account route and a blog route.

04:14.250 --> 04:20.770
And of course I want to know the respective components here so account without parentheses and log.

04:21.210 --> 04:26.110
This sets up some routes and if you wonder where do these routes get rendered.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.150
Well they're where we set them up.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.600
That is how do you react rather works.

04:30.870 --> 04:36.310
So nothing save this and keep in mind deep Rose says Endace terminal here is still running.

04:36.330 --> 04:42.180
We actually see an error and that's an important point which is not directly related to routing.

04:42.270 --> 04:45.010
We always need to import react.

04:45.210 --> 04:47.590
Even if we don't use it.

04:47.590 --> 04:54.630
So in our components here where I don't use react and I don't use component I still need to import re-act

04:54.720 --> 04:55.810
from react.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.990
Otherwise it will not work.

04:58.080 --> 05:04.820
So that shouldn't be too hard let's simply grab these import And it into all our files you're so into

05:04.820 --> 05:07.700
the block and into the account component.

05:07.700 --> 05:13.580
Now with that there's one thing we need to do and one thing you have to keep in mind your router here

05:13.790 --> 05:15.780
may only have one child.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.640
So we actually need a device here and wrap our routes in that.

05:19.640 --> 05:26.420
So that's simply just the same rule re-act imposes on us and that simply is the case because the router

05:26.420 --> 05:29.070
is just a wrapper around that.

05:29.090 --> 05:34.910
So in the end re-act still takes over and therefore everything within the router is the actual re-act

05:34.910 --> 05:37.070
component our app component here.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.330
So the rule of having one rude element still applies.

05:40.530 --> 05:46.430
If we now save this you'll see it gets reloaded and we're on the user page which makes sense because

05:46.430 --> 05:53.130
our route right now is just local Haast slash and nothing and slash nothing that would be the user.

05:53.150 --> 05:56.040
Now let's try out slash account.

05:56.040 --> 06:03.410
Now if I were AUPs account like that if I did that we see the account page but we also see the user

06:03.410 --> 06:04.520
page.

06:04.600 --> 06:10.400
Well the reason for that is that Slash is still part of the load loaded your l.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.430
We can fix this by adding exact here and just exact.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.930
We don't need to assign a value if we do that and it reloads.

06:17.930 --> 06:20.600
We see now we're just on the count page.

06:20.600 --> 06:26.840
If I it block we're on the block page and if I remove everything we're back on the starting.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.960
They used page.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.980
Now that's nice.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.430
What be nice to also have some links of though.

06:31.460 --> 06:34.140
So let's add some links in the next lecture.
