In the last lecture we created the basic to do application which allows us to add new elements.

00:08.170 --> 00:11.800
This is great but I also want to be able to remove them.

00:11.830 --> 00:19.690
So what I need to do is I need to add an event listener to the list item that when we click it we remove

00:19.690 --> 00:21.240
it basically.

00:21.310 --> 00:29.590
So what I'll do here where it created to do list item all gathered here and add an event listener as

00:29.620 --> 00:31.430
we already did before.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.800
I want to listen to the click event.

00:33.850 --> 00:39.010
So on this newly created list item and then I want to execute a function which I'll add here at the

00:39.010 --> 00:42.170
bottom which I'll name removed to do.

00:43.040 --> 00:50.120
Just like that and it will pass a reference to the function you're asked the second argument to my leave

00:50.120 --> 00:56.150
and listener remove to do now and remove to do I of course need to find out which element be clicked

00:56.210 --> 00:57.230
on.

00:57.230 --> 01:01.510
So here I will simply get the event object.

01:01.510 --> 01:04.970
You always get this by default passed by javascript.

01:04.970 --> 01:10.850
If we use event listener and there I can retrieve the list item we clicked on.

01:10.850 --> 01:15.770
So I'll create a new variable name it collect I.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.710
And that simply is my event.

01:17.750 --> 01:21.770
Target Target is a property we have on this event object by default.

01:21.770 --> 01:26.750
Again if that's new to you have a look at some tutorials focusing on Chalion trip to learn all these

01:26.750 --> 01:30.170
things about Dom access events and so on.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.360
So this is the element we clicked on.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.100
We now want to remove it and to remove it.

01:35.180 --> 01:43.070
I actually have to reach out to the parent node off the list item because on that note we can then call

01:43.220 --> 01:47.480
remove child and removed and remove the clicked.

01:47.590 --> 01:49.280
I like this.

01:49.280 --> 01:55.820
Now if I control enter open the console to see if we get any errors if I get buy milk and then if I

01:55.820 --> 02:00.870
also add answer questions maybe and I click on remove and by Molik it is removed.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.280
And here too.

02:02.770 --> 02:07.090
So dad is working but I'm still not 100 percent happy.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.380
We can improve this app a bit more.
