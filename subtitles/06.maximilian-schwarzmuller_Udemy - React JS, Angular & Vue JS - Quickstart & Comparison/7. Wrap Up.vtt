WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:09.120
In this module we had a detailed look at the web page workflow we used here why we use web page why

00:09.120 --> 00:18.510
we use node Yes and NPM how we can use features like ESX to make our developer's life easier and why

00:18.510 --> 00:20.500
we need a development server.

00:20.610 --> 00:24.930
Now the world of front and the workflow tools is bigger than that.

00:24.930 --> 00:30.300
There is good there are average task runners like Gollop or grunde which you could use alternatively

00:30.300 --> 00:31.180
to peg.

00:31.380 --> 00:35.010
But that again has enough content for a separate course on that.

00:35.040 --> 00:42.050
I hope that for you it is at least a bit easier now to understand why we use web pick why we use a setup

00:42.060 --> 00:43.050
like this.

00:43.050 --> 00:43.660
Why.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.560
Using features like the star view for us is interesting for us why we need no chairs and NPM and why

00:49.560 --> 00:51.470
we need a development server.

00:51.660 --> 00:56.250
And with that let's continue with our next framework which is re-act.
