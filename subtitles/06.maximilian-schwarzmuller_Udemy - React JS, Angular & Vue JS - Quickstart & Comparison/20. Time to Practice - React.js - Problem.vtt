00:02.500 --> 00:07.120
We'll learn a lot about react and especially after going for VHS.

00:07.130 --> 00:12.100
It can be confusing to stay in this javascript only world and see how reaction works.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.420
That is why we now need to practice it.

00:14.450 --> 00:19.550
You basically got the same task as any future section but now of course you should see all that with

00:19.550 --> 00:20.440
respect.

00:20.450 --> 00:26.840
So I want you to create a div for example with the idea app which is then controlled via react or to

00:26.840 --> 00:31.150
put it in better words where you then output a base component with react.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.050
So we're starting with a component right away.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.680
This app component maybe.

00:34.850 --> 00:41.810
And to give you a hint USD class syntax to iOS 6 syntax of creating to component not the function syntax

00:41.990 --> 00:45.550
because you will need to change something about this component then later.

00:45.590 --> 00:52.010
So that's the first part second part output an array of hobbies and this Def and you should provide

00:52.010 --> 00:58.340
some default hobby's third part add a new hobby button and put field where you can add that new hobby

00:58.760 --> 01:02.750
and make sure that this all works and that you can add new hobbies with the input button.

01:02.810 --> 01:07.640
You'll learn all the tools how to set up your own two way binding would react and how to output an array

01:07.640 --> 01:08.970
with this map method.

01:08.970 --> 01:15.050
And these things to remember forth part then is to make the hobby's clickable and remove them from the

01:15.050 --> 01:21.050
list once you collect them at a hobby delete that paragraph thereafter which is only shown if you delete

01:21.110 --> 01:21.920
the hobby.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.710
And again keep in mind you can delete hobbies by basically adding on click listener executing method

01:27.710 --> 01:32.430
which then changes your state and your hobbies array in that state to give you a hint.

01:32.870 --> 01:36.050
D6 part is to add a hobby counter.

01:36.050 --> 01:42.650
So basically a paragraph or above the list of hobbies which says hobby is coal and then well the number

01:42.650 --> 01:48.950
of elements in the array Basically I want you to dynamically style or and add classes to the hobby counter

01:49.250 --> 01:51.870
depending on whether you have three or more hobbies.

01:51.890 --> 01:58.490
So change the style in which every way you want and use either style or to class name property or both

01:58.670 --> 01:59.970
however you want.

02:00.500 --> 02:08.780
And then as a last step outsource to individual hobby element into component and here's the extra task

02:09.050 --> 02:11.460
make this a dumb component.

02:11.510 --> 02:17.570
So a component which only takes prompts to function form makes sure that you also create this connection

02:17.570 --> 02:21.750
to pass the click event to the parent component and execute a method there.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.980
You'll learn this in the last Electress too.

02:24.260 --> 02:30.740
So certainly challenging but doable only things you learned now in the solution you will see my solution

02:30.770 --> 02:33.230
and how you may go about solving this.
