In the last lecture we added links we added routes before and the routes in the Riak draw also define

00:09.360 --> 00:11.690
where the components will get loaded.

00:11.910 --> 00:17.040
Side note you could have multiple routes with the same pop and simply loads different components for

00:17.040 --> 00:17.670
the same path.

00:17.670 --> 00:19.430
That works too.

00:19.440 --> 00:26.140
Now of course one other thing we have to keep in mind is the server the same implications as for view

00:26.170 --> 00:28.040
Chase are important here.

00:28.620 --> 00:32.690
If we want to use the router with this style here.

00:32.730 --> 00:39.570
So where we have Slash accounts Flashblock our server needs to be configured in a way that it always

00:39.570 --> 00:48.070
returns the index h Kimmo file in case of 4 0 4 errors because these povs are first parsed by the server

00:48.570 --> 00:50.060
unlike the view router.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.660
This router doesn't use the hashtag mode by default which is great.

00:53.670 --> 00:58.440
We shouldn't use that mode of possible so therefore if you deploy you react.

00:58.530 --> 01:05.520
Using the re-act router you need to make sure that your server actually always returns to the next age

01:05.520 --> 01:09.950
Tim file so that the reactor router has a chance of taking over.

01:09.990 --> 01:16.140
In cases where your server doesn't recognize routes which probably the case for all your problems in

01:16.140 --> 01:17.670
a single page application.
