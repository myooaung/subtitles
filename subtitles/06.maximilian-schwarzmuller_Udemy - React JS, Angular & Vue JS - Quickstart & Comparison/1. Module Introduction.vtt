Welcome to this course module we just got started and we already had a look at why the future as in

00:08.780 --> 00:13.210
the example we used might be better than Ciccone for some tasks.

00:13.220 --> 00:18.380
Now in this module We'll take a closer look at these javascript frameworks and you will learn that there

00:18.380 --> 00:21.610
are actually two different ways of using them.

00:21.650 --> 00:27.790
You will learn how these two ways look and when you might choose which way and how frameworks can in

00:27.790 --> 00:30.560
general help you in your application.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.870
So let's get started.
