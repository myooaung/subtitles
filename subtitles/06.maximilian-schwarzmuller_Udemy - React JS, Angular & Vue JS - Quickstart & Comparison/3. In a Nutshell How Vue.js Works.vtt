00:02.650 --> 00:08.180
And The Last Lecture we create at this very basic view chess application we took control over this staff

00:08.180 --> 00:10.660
and output some of our data.

00:10.670 --> 00:18.920
Now when I say take control you could believe that in the actual dorm which is parsed by the browser

00:19.010 --> 00:24.360
we still have this HDMI code and view chaced dynamically exchange is this.

00:24.550 --> 00:25.850
This is not the case.

00:26.060 --> 00:32.980
If we open up the developer tools and we inspectors name your U.S. then we have Dave with the IDF but

00:32.990 --> 00:36.720
the curly braces part is gone entirely.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.030
Now that's important to understand.

00:39.250 --> 00:44.780
The just takes control over this part but then it can work to Javascript.

00:44.780 --> 00:52.190
So what happens is this page does HD page with this javascript code being part of it is served to the

00:52.190 --> 00:54.190
client on the client.

00:54.200 --> 01:01.190
Javascript now runs and the first thing which runs is our view Chesed code gets executed in this code

01:01.520 --> 01:07.400
view chess recognizes that we want to take this section of the H HTML code as a template.

01:07.610 --> 01:14.630
So what it does is it reads this part of D.H. G-mail page and turns it into javascript you could say

01:15.050 --> 01:18.060
it creates its own word should dawn.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.870
So Dawn which doesn't really exist in the browser but in javascript.

01:21.870 --> 01:28.410
Now the reason for this is that javascript is much faster to be accessed than the real dawn.

01:29.180 --> 01:35.230
As a nextstep you chase paresis does were chilled Dom for commands that recognizes like to double the

01:35.240 --> 01:41.720
braces syntax which simply is a syntax built into view chase and replaces it appropriately.

01:41.720 --> 01:49.150
So here it parses stairs sees that name as a valid data property and therefore outputs the actual name.

01:49.250 --> 01:57.260
It then renderers is updated word shilled on as our real Daun does is what happens in a.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.980
At the point of time as EPS starts.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.030
Which is why we just see the text your you chested everything behind the scenes.
