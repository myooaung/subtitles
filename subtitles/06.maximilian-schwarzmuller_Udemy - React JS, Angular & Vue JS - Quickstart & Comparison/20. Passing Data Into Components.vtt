00:02.520 --> 00:05.620
We want to have flexible and reusable components right.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.850
Right now this component is reusable.

00:07.860 --> 00:14.800
Yes we can add at multiple times by simply repeat repeating this task but we can set the data from outside.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.350
It would be nice if we could do.

00:16.620 --> 00:17.610
And we can do this.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.500
It's a core feature of angular.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.680
We can use a special decorator again.

00:22.710 --> 00:30.770
So if the sign but now not added to the class but to just property decorators can all be added to properties.

00:30.780 --> 00:35.810
The decorator we need here is to at input decorator and don't forget the parentheses.

00:35.850 --> 00:38.770
You need to execute that decorator.

00:38.890 --> 00:40.710
Now it's not known like this.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.040
We need to import it and we do imported from angular core.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.680
So here we simply add input without the sign here.

00:48.690 --> 00:52.700
Just like with component where we also didn't add the sign in the import.

00:52.830 --> 01:00.890
Now dishtowels angler this property is the input of this component which means we can set it from outside

01:02.090 --> 01:03.780
to set it from outside.

01:04.020 --> 01:12.360
I will go to my app component h I'll fall and now on my custom component I can use property binding

01:12.360 --> 01:16.530
again to bind to user name and now pass any data I want.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.590
Like a string with single quotation marks.

01:18.630 --> 01:25.040
Chris and on the second component we could therefore pass another like that.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.620
Now with that I can go back to the command.

01:27.630 --> 01:31.200
I could leave my default string but I will remove it instead.

01:31.220 --> 01:36.840
I will add a type definition again to inform typescript that this will eventually be a string.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.360
We only pass a string here.

01:39.360 --> 01:45.690
Now if I now safe to we go back to the app you see now we have Chris and Anna here because now that's

01:45.690 --> 01:52.680
the day that we set from outside and with input we can pass it into the component to compare it with

01:53.070 --> 01:55.480
view and a bit to react.

01:55.560 --> 01:59.890
That is basically what props were in these two frameworks here.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.680
It's called input you could say.
