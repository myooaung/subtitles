You'll learn a lot about the base and text view sheriff's office.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.830
Of course there is more to it.

00:07.930 --> 00:14.650
But this only is an introduction to it to give you first understanding on how you chess works and if

00:14.650 --> 00:17.890
you find it interesting to dive deeper into it.

00:17.890 --> 00:24.310
One important thing I want to note right now we always use this single def which holds our app here

00:24.650 --> 00:26.650
and we have this single instance.

00:27.010 --> 00:36.010
You're not limited to one instance you could have a second day of your with ID app to or any ID you

00:36.010 --> 00:36.860
like.

00:37.030 --> 00:45.460
And there we could have a paragraph second view instance and then maybe Whoops another paragraph below

00:45.460 --> 00:48.150
it where we output some message.

00:48.460 --> 00:52.000
And for this to work of course I'll add a new instance.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.230
So this is outside of the first one pass much scope object as set.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.300
Of course I want to control abt you.

00:59.470 --> 01:04.540
As a side note if you try to control app here well then only one of the two will get active.

01:04.540 --> 01:10.600
You can't control the same part of the code with the two different view instances.

01:10.600 --> 01:18.850
So let's control at 2 with a hash tag those who are selected by id and then data all set message since

01:18.950 --> 01:20.860
as well try to output here.

01:21.070 --> 01:22.420
Hello there.

01:22.540 --> 01:28.120
And if we now had control enter you see Hello there but that actually is part of our second viewing

01:28.120 --> 01:29.010
stands.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.490
So there is nothing wrong with that.

01:30.490 --> 01:37.550
That's actually not that uncommon that you control different parts in your app with different view instances.
