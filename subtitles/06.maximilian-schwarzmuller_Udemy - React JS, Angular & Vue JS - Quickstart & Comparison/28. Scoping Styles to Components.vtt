In the last lecture we recognized that the text here of our info component also is a Taluk.

00:09.350 --> 00:14.800
Now you could think that's the case because we included in the user component and dare we set the style

00:14.800 --> 00:19.220
to apply as a taluk style to all paragraphs that kind of is true.

00:19.330 --> 00:28.450
But if we were to add a style or a paragraph excuse me to our Aptos view fall like this is a test.

00:28.530 --> 00:36.180
So a couple of which definitely is not a child component of our user dog you file and we now save we

00:36.180 --> 00:37.080
see that here.

00:37.100 --> 00:44.110
This is also the Telic the reason for it is this by default all the styles are applied as Globalstar

00:44.160 --> 00:44.720
in our app.

00:44.730 --> 00:51.990
They're not scoped to a specific component but we can force this scoping by adding scopes as an attribute

00:52.140 --> 00:52.900
to the styles.

00:52.900 --> 01:00.750
Heck if we do this and save again and reload our page you will see that the user and the info components

01:00.840 --> 01:07.850
which are indeed in their relation still use the Telic styling but the app thought view file so a root

01:07.860 --> 01:13.260
component where we all have a paragraph does not use it because now the styling is really scoped to

01:13.260 --> 01:16.500
the component and it's shared components where we defined it in.
