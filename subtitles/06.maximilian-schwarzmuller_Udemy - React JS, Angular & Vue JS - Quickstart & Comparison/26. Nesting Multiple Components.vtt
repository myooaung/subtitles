00:02.710 --> 00:04.360
Noted we learned how we can use to.

00:04.420 --> 00:06.140
Let's create another component.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.030
All name and info.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.690
Now that will give us a new folder again info with all the files you solve before.

00:12.720 --> 00:17.310
Remove the test file maybe leave Oliveri on anything and here again we won't use it.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.130
It doesn't hurt us if it sits there though.

00:20.260 --> 00:26.100
Now what I want to do is I want to use this info component in my user component.

00:26.110 --> 00:32.290
Note that both have been added to the app module by the Selye so the info component has a selector of

00:32.410 --> 00:33.640
app info.

00:33.700 --> 00:41.800
I can simply go to my usual component and maybe output let's say age 3 tag at the top.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.030
The user and in the paragraph here I don't want to output.

00:46.030 --> 00:55.240
My username is and then username and I want to use app info below that now in my user component typescript

00:55.240 --> 00:56.280
file.

00:56.350 --> 01:02.550
I'll add the user name property which I output and assign a value of Max whatever name you like.

01:03.610 --> 01:05.290
And info.

01:05.380 --> 01:10.940
Well here I'll simply say angular is really awesome like that.

01:11.410 --> 01:17.300
If we now save us and Angi service still running make sure to rerun it if you quit the process.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.320
So now with that we only see AB works.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.320
Why.

01:21.880 --> 01:27.310
Well because we created new components but keep in mind we have to add them in our root component or

01:27.310 --> 01:28.450
at least one of the two.

01:28.510 --> 01:33.960
The user component in this case since the user component includes the info component in its template.

01:33.970 --> 01:41.340
So in my Achmad HMO fall I'll simply add app user which is the selector of the user component as defined

01:41.350 --> 01:42.090
here.

01:42.490 --> 01:48.070
Now if I save this and I go back as soon as this reloads we see day user My username is max angle.

01:48.100 --> 01:53.620
That's pretty awesome and that is how we can work with multiple components nece them into each other

01:53.670 --> 01:54.040
to.
