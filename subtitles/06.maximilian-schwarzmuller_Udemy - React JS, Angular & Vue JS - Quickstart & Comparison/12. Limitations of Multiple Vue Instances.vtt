00:02.360 --> 00:08.280
And The Last Lecture I told you that you can create multiple instances and control different parts on

00:08.280 --> 00:09.000
your page.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.840
And that is true and that is absolutely fine.

00:11.850 --> 00:19.610
This approach has one potential downside though what if you want to really use your view instance.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.580
Right now we take control of or discard it and that's it.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.930
All right we control that by idea and therefore we only control this part.

00:26.970 --> 00:36.540
Now we could try to be clever we could create a new device where we have a class which is username and

00:36.540 --> 00:45.350
then let's say I'll try to outpoured username here and on our copy this code added a second time and

00:45.360 --> 00:53.880
I'll add a third instance down there and in this new instance I'll pass an object I'll control element.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.010
Now select that with Dot username.

00:56.010 --> 01:08.160
So by class not not not by id and in the data property I now try to set user name equal to max noti

01:08.210 --> 01:15.240
hope would be to see Max twice here at the bottom of our page but if I hit Control enter We only see

01:15.240 --> 01:18.870
it once and the second time we see call the braces username.

01:18.870 --> 01:25.000
So the second day of year clearly it's not controlled by the future yes and that's the default and intend

01:25.020 --> 01:26.110
behavior.

01:26.250 --> 01:31.630
It will only select and control the first occurrence of this selector it finds.

01:31.680 --> 01:38.550
So the first day of which is class therefore the second one is simply ignored a view instance can only

01:38.550 --> 01:46.260
control one part of your code not multiple ones but there is a solution which actually allows us to

01:46.260 --> 01:49.610
achieve what we want using components.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.870
So let's take a look at components in the next lecture.
