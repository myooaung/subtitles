WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:06.340
So where are you successful let's solve this task to Gebre.

00:06.610 --> 00:12.610
I'll leave the instructions here and I'll start with the death which you all assigned an idea of app

00:12.740 --> 00:15.820
again app doesn't have to be the name you choose here.

00:15.860 --> 00:22.940
Let's then use the new View future as is already imported here and set L to hash tag and take control

00:22.970 --> 00:24.570
over the staff.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.150
That's already task one solved.

00:28.160 --> 00:33.590
Now let's add a list of hobbies and for that I need my data property a javascript object.

00:33.590 --> 00:39.530
And since we're not in a component business now not a function but just the object here I'll have my

00:39.530 --> 00:40.410
hobbies.

00:40.520 --> 00:48.240
That's an array and I'll add sports and cookies here cookies cooking all like cooking cookies too though

00:48.990 --> 00:54.020
I don't want your output desiré so add on or at least with a list item.

00:54.020 --> 00:59.000
And we learned we can use the for to loop through elements in a list.

00:59.030 --> 01:06.440
So here I can loop through all my hobbies in my hobbies array referring to dicere and it can output

01:06.470 --> 01:09.740
the individual hobby now like this.

01:09.740 --> 01:13.850
If I had control enter we see the two hobby's stare.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.250
Now that is nice.

01:15.290 --> 01:21.140
And that's also part 2 solved part 3 is to add a new hobby button.

01:21.140 --> 01:27.200
So above my on order list all at the input field where the user was able to enter something and a button

01:27.230 --> 01:30.340
where else a new hobby like dat.

01:30.410 --> 01:32.270
And then I wanted to add a click listener.

01:32.540 --> 01:36.200
And I Dudas with we on and then click.

01:36.200 --> 01:44.510
So now you're all named as at Hobby and I'll add my methods property to to the instance as you learn

01:44.580 --> 01:47.620
to register methods we can call from the template.

01:47.850 --> 01:55.080
So here at Hobby is the name of the function because that is what is set up here at Hobby function and

01:55.080 --> 01:58.100
I want to add my new hobby year for that.

01:58.110 --> 02:04.920
I need to add another property user hobby any name you like which is an empty string initially but more

02:04.920 --> 02:10.820
important which I now bind via the model as you learned it.

02:10.860 --> 02:14.840
Now a user hobby will be updated whenever I type something here.

02:15.030 --> 02:20.730
So once I click the button I can now fetch de-valued to user last entered so I can now reach out to

02:20.730 --> 02:27.430
Hobbes and push a new item on desiré and basically would push this user hobby.

02:27.540 --> 02:31.610
And you could add some code to check whether does an empty string or not.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.310
I'll just go with the simpler approach.

02:34.320 --> 02:40.680
Now if I had control enter and I enter reading here and hit you a hobby that is added Of course I can

02:40.680 --> 02:42.970
add it multiple times but that doesn't matter.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.400
Your disease task Freethought solved task 4 is a bit tricky.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.270
We want to make these hobby's clickable and therefore removable.

02:53.610 --> 02:57.220
I'll add this in a new line just to make it easier to read here.

02:57.350 --> 03:02.700
I'll add the on and click because I want to react to a click on this hobby and I want to execute.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.360
Remove Harbi in this case.

03:05.370 --> 03:07.530
Now here I need to pass to hobby.

03:07.530 --> 03:16.030
I want to remove as an argument and then I can go to my methods and add remove hobby year to a function.

03:16.170 --> 03:20.570
I noted I will receive the hobby I want to remove as an argument.

03:21.000 --> 03:30.100
And now I can find this hobby by getting the position so the position by reaching out to this hobby's

03:30.490 --> 03:37.180
index off that's a built in function javascript offers where you can search for an element in this array

03:37.540 --> 03:39.840
and then iterate through the set rate.

03:39.880 --> 03:45.340
The elements I have here are stored in Harbi will be taken from that array and therefore I can find

03:45.340 --> 03:46.510
them in the array.

03:47.360 --> 03:55.010
So now if the position found I can reach out to hobby's again called splice and splice the element at

03:55.010 --> 03:57.950
this position and only this element.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.440
So splice will now remove this element from the array.

04:01.730 --> 04:11.690
If we hit enter again and I add reading and maybe also party or whatever and I click on cooking it's

04:11.690 --> 04:17.540
removed reading is removed then if we open the console we see no errors here.

04:17.540 --> 04:19.770
So that's all working.

04:19.790 --> 04:27.200
So that is a number element removed or overtasked so that should say make the hobby's clickable and

04:27.200 --> 04:28.380
remove them.

04:28.430 --> 04:35.770
Now the next part is to conditionally show hubby delete that as soon as a hobby was deleted.

04:36.020 --> 04:39.150
Well conditions we learned about that.

04:39.200 --> 04:44.780
Let's add another paragraph above the on or the list Harbi was deleted.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.360
Something like that.

04:46.460 --> 04:52.700
And now we want to use the if you learned about that the IF allows you to control whether something

04:52.700 --> 04:59.750
should be shown or not actually whether something should be added to the dom or not.

04:59.750 --> 05:08.130
So let's set up we if here and I will refer to Harbi was delete it.

05:08.150 --> 05:09.750
Now what's that.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.950
That is a property I yet have to define and I will do what is in the data property where we store all

05:15.950 --> 05:18.050
the data we want to use.

05:18.050 --> 05:26.840
Hubby was deleted and initially this is fault because initially we didn't delete any hobby but and remove

05:26.840 --> 05:35.090
hobby which is called as soon as I do want to remove one I can now execute or I can now set this hobby

05:35.090 --> 05:36.980
was deleted.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.030
So there's property here.

05:40.230 --> 05:48.330
I can now set it to true and therefore if I had control enter we don't see this text but if I add something

05:48.390 --> 05:53.350
and I don't even have to add something for it to work and I remove any of the hobbies.

05:53.400 --> 05:59.310
Now the hobby was deleted and now this is going to stay here because we have no way of turning this

05:59.310 --> 06:00.770
back to false.

06:00.780 --> 06:05.870
This hobby was to leave the property if we were to turn it back to force hobby was to lead it would

06:05.880 --> 06:07.210
all disappear.

06:07.560 --> 06:16.480
But dead now is the next task sold showing Harbi deleted or maybe Wasil eat it here let's add a counter

06:16.720 --> 06:22.360
that shouldn't be too tough if we add another paragraph above the add on to list.

06:22.660 --> 06:24.590
And we have hobbies.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.950
Now we can use string interpellation to output a number or a text here.

06:29.950 --> 06:34.480
The question just is how do we know how many hobbies we have in the array.

06:34.690 --> 06:41.030
Well javascript gives us some built in tools we can't just use our hobby's array.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.120
The one we also use here in the loop.

06:43.420 --> 06:50.070
And then the built in length property to get the amount of elements in this array.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.440
If I had control Antar we already see two here.

06:53.620 --> 07:00.430
And if I add more while this clearly grows because again beauteous automatically keeps track about days

07:00.490 --> 07:08.130
and updates to Dom in this bought whenever required whenever anything we output here changes.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.080
So that is the next task already solved.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.070
Adding the hobby counter.

07:13.270 --> 07:18.610
Now we want a style this dynamically and it's totally up to you which styles and which approach you

07:18.610 --> 07:19.720
choose here.

07:19.900 --> 07:23.910
I'll show you both style binding and class binding.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.950
Let's start with style binding.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.440
I'll use the bind style here.

07:30.300 --> 07:37.980
To set my own style so here I'll pass a javascript object as we have to so that chess is able to understand

07:37.980 --> 07:41.090
this and I want to set a style.

07:41.100 --> 07:46.940
Let's say I want to set the color of the text and again choose whichever thing you want to style here

07:47.520 --> 07:51.250
I'll set the color of the text and I want to set it to red.

07:51.270 --> 07:58.150
If we have more than free hobby's So here we can check if hobby's length is greater than three.

07:58.290 --> 08:04.100
And you could outsource this into a method you call here as you saw it in the last lectures.

08:04.110 --> 08:10.440
I'll use internet expression so if hobby length is greater than free then color and does has to be a

08:10.440 --> 08:16.760
string otherwise view Chase would look for a data property which fits whatever you type here.

08:17.130 --> 08:23.760
So if it is greater than 3 then I want to set the color to let's say red and otherwise I want to set

08:23.760 --> 08:31.470
a black set to the default and I'll just make this a bit broader so that you can see this if I had control

08:31.470 --> 08:36.890
enter now and I enter reading added twice.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.050
Now Hobbes becomes red.

08:39.570 --> 08:40.740
So that is nice.

08:40.740 --> 08:43.420
And if I remove one it's black.

08:43.590 --> 08:55.090
So that dynamic styling works I'll now also add a class here and I'll name dishcloths multiple hobby's

08:55.090 --> 08:57.080
with a dash.

08:57.230 --> 09:04.490
And here I want to gift is a border let's say so a border of one pixel is solid and also red.

09:04.490 --> 09:08.280
If we have multiple mordent free hobbies.

09:08.750 --> 09:13.240
So here I'll bring this into a new line again to make it a bit easier to read.

09:13.250 --> 09:17.840
It's still on the same paragraph though I'll add another we bind statement.

09:17.900 --> 09:23.900
Now binding to a class here as you learned with all the paths and javascript object.

09:23.900 --> 09:28.010
And now we need to define the class name as the property.

09:28.010 --> 09:36.740
So here there will be multiple hobbies and Endace multiple hobbies or does multiple hobbies class I

09:36.740 --> 09:43.080
need to use single quotation marks is invalid character that dash does should be attached.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.470
Now if.

09:44.660 --> 09:50.920
Well if hobby length is greater than free and I don't need to return true or false because this already

09:50.920 --> 09:57.430
is a check here right so you could say if that is graded and free and this is true otherwise it is false

09:57.620 --> 09:59.160
but you don't have to do that.

09:59.210 --> 10:03.020
This already is a condition which will return true or false.

10:03.140 --> 10:09.130
If I hit Enter control enter now and I again add reading nothing happens.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.360
If I add it again.

10:10.430 --> 10:15.070
You see now we get this border which stems from this CSSA class.

10:15.110 --> 10:18.100
So this is how we can use an Amec styling and classes.

10:18.230 --> 10:29.700
As you learned it now we're already reaching the last task outsourcing these list items here into their

10:29.700 --> 10:31.020
own component.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.710
And that of course also means that we will have to make sure that the klick listens on still works.

10:36.150 --> 10:41.650
So I will add a new component with the new component as you learn it.

10:41.730 --> 10:47.520
Now we should use a selector and the selector of course has to be something which doesn't interfere

10:47.520 --> 10:54.600
with an existing HDMI element therefore it's a good idea to pick something which is 100 percent guaranteed

10:54.840 --> 11:02.880
or 99 percent guaranteed to be unique like app hobby prefixing it with app dash is a great way of ensuring

11:03.060 --> 11:09.230
that you're not overriding HVM l element which might exist in the future for example.

11:09.570 --> 11:12.050
And there we passed our object.

11:12.180 --> 11:18.740
We now want to get the hobby from outside because we will loop through this component and replicate

11:18.740 --> 11:23.940
it as Office need it and the array of hobbies is outside of this component.

11:23.940 --> 11:31.560
So I'll add props and I noted I will get my individual hobby here and now with this we can replace this

11:31.620 --> 11:40.560
list item your with app hobby like dead and pass the hobby.

11:40.730 --> 11:50.130
But first of all we need to set up we for it to still loop from our hobbies like debt and then let me

11:50.130 --> 11:56.890
bring this into one line then I'll bind with we bind to hobby.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.270
So to the hobby we find here.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.900
Let's maybe to make this easier.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.700
Let's rename this to HPI each.

12:04.950 --> 12:13.410
Why so HP Why is then passed to the hobby so to the property we're binding to in this component.

12:13.410 --> 12:17.180
If we do this well our app is broken.

12:17.190 --> 12:21.490
The reason for it is of course is that we need to find a template right.

12:21.570 --> 12:24.280
So let's add a template to our component.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.330
This template is a string.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.570
It should hold our a list item of course and then the list item.

12:30.600 --> 12:36.450
I'll use string a tribulation to output to hobby which again is set from outside.

12:36.450 --> 12:42.020
Now if we had control enter we see sports and cooking and we can add reading again.

12:42.240 --> 12:47.940
Dad all works but we need to make that click listener work because right now nothing happens because

12:47.940 --> 12:51.660
there is no click listener on this list item anymore.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.660
Let's reintroduce that.

12:53.670 --> 13:00.270
So with the on click we can listen to clicks in this component and I want to execute.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.550
Remove hobby then.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.300
And therefore I now need to have a method.

13:06.480 --> 13:14.950
So in the method property I'll add remove Harbi as a function and that by the way is iOS 6 syntax.

13:15.030 --> 13:19.120
The long form is five would be the one you saw before.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.590
Remove Hobley like dat.

13:21.730 --> 13:23.820
So remove hobby.

13:24.190 --> 13:28.280
And now here as you learn that we need to emit our own event.

13:28.300 --> 13:33.280
We can listen to the parent component or in the parent template.

13:33.280 --> 13:40.530
So where we used this hobby here so here I will therefore called this.

13:40.730 --> 13:48.350
Now give it any event name you want like Harbi remove and keep in mind this has to be case insensitive

13:48.380 --> 13:51.630
so don't try hobby removed right now.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.630
And here I have to pass the hobby which was removed so I'll simply pass Harbi the prop here.

14:00.860 --> 14:01.900
This hobby.

14:01.940 --> 14:11.160
Therefore now referring to our prop now with Ted we can listen to this event on our own component's

14:11.170 --> 14:11.720
here.

14:12.550 --> 14:18.540
So let's use the on and listen to Harbi remove the event we defined here.

14:19.640 --> 14:23.120
And they are we know we get this hobby as an argument.

14:23.240 --> 14:30.350
So now we can call remove Harbi the function we defined in this view instance which controls this template.

14:30.350 --> 14:37.550
Call remove hobby and past dollar sign event which just to bring this back into your memory will always

14:37.700 --> 14:41.200
automatically be populated with Event Data.

14:41.240 --> 14:51.500
You emit here this event data now with that our code should work again if I add reading here works and

14:51.500 --> 14:57.500
if I remove it it indeed is removed and we don't see any error here.

14:58.010 --> 15:02.250
So that is the basic set up here.

15:02.270 --> 15:04.160
Now there are things we can improve.

15:04.160 --> 15:11.160
There are a lot of things we can dive deeper into but for a first overview this is really great.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.380
We get all the tasks solved now.

15:13.580 --> 15:18.980
Time to have a look at how we can use view chips in a single page application because this code could

15:18.980 --> 15:25.550
have been dropped in any multi-page application to the individual pages of such application before we

15:25.550 --> 15:30.410
then leave that view chase after having a look at the single page application to also have a look at

15:30.410 --> 15:31.550
the other frameworks.
