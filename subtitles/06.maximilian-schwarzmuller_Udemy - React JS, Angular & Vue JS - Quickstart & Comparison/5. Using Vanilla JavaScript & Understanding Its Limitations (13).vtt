00:02.630 --> 00:08.510
So in this jazz full editor here I want to create a basic to do app.

00:08.510 --> 00:14.120
So let's add input and the nice thing on Chia's footless we can just type input and then hit enter to

00:14.120 --> 00:16.930
create the input element type text as OK.

00:17.270 --> 00:22.730
We also need a button so that we are able to submit this to add to to do so maybe let's give it a caption

00:22.750 --> 00:23.900
I'll at to do.

00:24.110 --> 00:29.690
And then we need someplace where we can render all these to do's in an ordered list probably.

00:29.860 --> 00:33.320
So that is all the HDL code I need for now.

00:33.320 --> 00:38.870
Now in javascript we need to get access to all these elements create new list items and add them to

00:38.870 --> 00:39.460
the list.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.980
So let's do so now.

00:41.220 --> 00:45.510
I'll trade a variable here which will name input al the name is up to you.

00:45.690 --> 00:52.760
Wearable use document queries selector Bouldon Methot javascript offers which allows me to select the

00:52.760 --> 00:59.230
element by its CSSA selector and I can just use input to select input element.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.070
Side note if this is brand new to you.

01:02.330 --> 01:07.340
Definitely make sure to dive into some cores dedicated to teaching you javascript.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.070
This is not the goal of this course.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.180
You won't learn Javascript in this course.

01:11.210 --> 01:13.730
I do expect you to ever know it already.

01:13.730 --> 01:17.300
Or as I just mentioned to have some courseware you follow along.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.190
Discourse is about helping you make the next step.

01:20.210 --> 01:24.570
Choosing the right framework for the job for Fronto development.

01:24.980 --> 01:27.240
So this selects the input element.

01:27.440 --> 01:35.600
Let's now add button Al-Q with document queries selector button to also get access to that Butland are

01:35.600 --> 01:37.160
done now.

01:37.160 --> 01:45.010
Finally I'll add u l l to also get X's cutis on or at least to quilt creese selector.

01:45.050 --> 01:47.470
You l will give us access to it.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.400
We got access to all these elements.

01:49.400 --> 01:54.800
Now we need to add an event listener to the button so that whenever we click it we do add a new to do

01:55.460 --> 02:04.550
so let's wrap this button element this variable here and use an event listener like this listener to

02:04.550 --> 02:07.600
add a new listener a click event.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.810
And here I want to execute a function which will create your own name this function.

02:11.810 --> 02:17.130
Add to do like this in normal javascript function your.

02:17.420 --> 02:22.790
And now we can pass a reference to the function to the event listener as a second argument ad to do

02:22.970 --> 02:25.710
and make sure to not add parentheses thereafter.

02:25.790 --> 02:32.300
I only want to store the link to this function so to say I don't want to execute it here.

02:32.540 --> 02:36.690
So in add to do we now want to create a new list item.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.220
So I will simply named as to do I.

02:40.250 --> 02:46.040
The name is up to you and hearable you stuck humand create element to create such a new element.

02:46.860 --> 02:51.540
And here we simply pass the tag DHC email tag off the element you want to create else.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.930
In this case list item.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.280
Now of course we all should add whatever the user entered.

02:57.620 --> 03:04.400
So we need to fetch dead and that will actually fetch that before we create this list item because maybe

03:04.400 --> 03:06.390
the user didn't enter anything.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.410
And in this case I don't want to create a new list item so I will check we're able retrieved to user

03:12.410 --> 03:19.310
input user input from our input element and then we can access the value property wups property not

03:19.310 --> 03:25.850
method which is a default property provided by chala script on input h t m l elements.

03:25.850 --> 03:29.660
Now this gives us the well value the user entered.

03:29.660 --> 03:36.280
Now I want to check whether this is empty so I can check user input and then maybe trim a built in javascript

03:36.290 --> 03:42.260
function to remove all leading or trailing whitespace so that we rule out the case that the user entered

03:42.350 --> 03:49.580
just a couple of whitespace as blanks so I will then compare to trim the value to an empty string.

03:49.870 --> 03:53.850
And if the string is empty so if the user didn't enter anything I just want to return.

03:53.850 --> 03:55.980
I don't want to continue execution.

03:56.560 --> 04:03.760
If we do have a valid input I want to create a list item though and then I can say to do list item text

04:03.760 --> 04:11.830
content to now set the text content of this newly created list item equal to the user input.

04:11.830 --> 04:17.470
Now finally with the list item created we just have to add it to the dorm to our unordered list.

04:17.620 --> 04:23.300
So I can use my u l l variable which holds a reference to this unordered list in the dawn.

04:23.410 --> 04:28.720
And there I can call append child to add this to do list item.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.280
Now that is our basic app beheading control enter in Chase fuddle.

04:33.430 --> 04:36.920
We do render it so we see that input element here.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.060
If I click add to do like this nothing happens.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.970
If we open up the console log we see no error.

04:42.970 --> 04:50.230
Besides this one which we may ignore but if I now say buy milk so if I enter something velvet it is

04:50.270 --> 04:51.070
at it.

04:51.210 --> 04:54.040
If I enter a couple of white spaces nothing happens.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.440
But if I enter.

04:55.590 --> 04:58.130
Answer questions here.

04:58.410 --> 05:00.000
We got this too.

05:00.030 --> 05:05.450
So that is our basic very basic to do application working.

05:05.520 --> 05:13.020
However I want to add more functionally to it before we dive into libraries to see why vanilla javascript

05:13.290 --> 05:15.510
might not be everything we need here.
