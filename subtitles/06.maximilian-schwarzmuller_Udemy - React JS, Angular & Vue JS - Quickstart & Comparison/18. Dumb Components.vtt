The Last Lecture we created our own username and we used this function syntax.

00:08.270 --> 00:13.520
Now on the first look decent X might look limited because we can't set the stage here.

00:13.850 --> 00:15.880
However that also is an advantage.

00:16.040 --> 00:19.600
We know that we can't set and change to state in there.

00:19.760 --> 00:26.500
So it's a immutable component it can change from within it's a dump component and therefore it actually

00:26.600 --> 00:32.750
is a good practice to only have a couple of components which have a state and which change to state

00:33.140 --> 00:39.980
and then have more components like this which only output stuff this component can still change but

00:39.980 --> 00:42.690
only if you change the prop's from outside.

00:42.980 --> 00:48.860
So if we were to store the user names in the state of the app component and change it does come on here

00:48.860 --> 00:50.720
would get updated in the dorm too.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.450
But this is very efficient.

00:52.490 --> 00:55.440
Since Riak knows to discard change from within.

00:55.580 --> 00:56.980
That's just a side note.

00:57.170 --> 00:59.500
And it's already a bit advanced to be honest.

00:59.660 --> 01:04.850
But I wanted to mention it here so that you don't think that this function form of creating components

01:04.880 --> 01:05.840
is bad.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.300
It's just a different tool.

01:07.370 --> 01:11.200
But if you don't need to change the state use that it's better.
