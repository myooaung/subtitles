00:02.470 --> 00:06.050
So in the last lecture we learned that we actually do have a component here.

00:06.070 --> 00:11.440
However this is kind of a special component since we use it to replace everything in our controlled

00:11.440 --> 00:11.790
day.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.370
And in this age team will fall.

00:13.720 --> 00:19.820
Let's simply create a new component and I'll do this in a subfolder which I'll name components here.

00:19.930 --> 00:27.440
I will create my user view file and in that user don't view file.

00:27.490 --> 00:36.070
I'll stick to the scheme of having a template a script section and then a style section in the template

00:36.100 --> 00:38.650
section there's one important thing to keep in mind.

00:38.740 --> 00:41.780
You must have one and only one root element.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.760
So like wrapping Dave year gives us an idea of user inside of the def.

00:47.830 --> 00:51.650
You may now have as many sibling elements as you want here.

00:51.670 --> 01:00.970
I will say the user in a paragraph where I say my user name is and I want to output user name

01:04.540 --> 01:07.300
so that is string interpolation being used here.

01:07.310 --> 01:10.090
But of course we don't have any data object.

01:10.210 --> 01:15.220
So in the script section I will export default objects.

01:15.220 --> 01:19.840
I will export my default object so that you can imported from Alber files.

01:20.170 --> 01:25.920
That is just exporting a javascript object and then export a javascript object.

01:25.930 --> 01:31.310
I will now set up my data method where I return an object as you learned for components.

01:31.540 --> 01:35.340
And here I will set username to Max.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.260
Now that's all.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.900
I'll also add some styles though.

01:39.100 --> 01:50.140
I'll get the paragraph a styling where I will simply set the font style to italic to make it Welker's

01:50.150 --> 01:51.770
of.

01:51.870 --> 01:56.780
Now with that if we save this nothing would happen.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.990
We have to import this user.

01:59.030 --> 02:01.640
You fought in the file we want to use it.

02:01.670 --> 02:04.340
That's this modular code I was referring to.

02:04.700 --> 02:11.180
So an apt view which is the file which now will host all our other components which is our root template.

02:11.180 --> 02:11.820
We now use.

02:11.870 --> 02:18.620
So to say I will get rid of all the boilerplate code code to template created.

02:18.980 --> 02:24.440
I will get rid of all the styling down there to course feel free to keep it but I don't need it.

02:24.620 --> 02:30.110
Get rid of the style text entirely We don't need them therefore And now I want to import or add my own

02:30.110 --> 02:31.180
component.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.270
Now to do so.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.260
We have two options.

02:34.460 --> 02:42.380
We can either register our user component here in the main dot js file as it learned with view component

02:42.920 --> 02:49.810
give it a selector app user maybe and then refer to that export to user object.

02:49.910 --> 02:59.330
So simply import user from dot slash components user dot view and assign it like this.

02:59.330 --> 03:03.840
Remember before we had an object here with template data and so on.

03:04.070 --> 03:06.280
Well that's just what we're exporting here now.

03:06.350 --> 03:10.880
An object and a template is automatically added as a template for this component.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.670
So with that we set up a component.

03:13.670 --> 03:17.160
We may now use in our entire app wherever we want.

03:17.210 --> 03:23.180
Not just in the update view file but here for example we can of course also use it and it will import

03:23.260 --> 03:24.130
AB user.

03:24.380 --> 03:30.730
If we now had save this should automatically recompile and reload our browser and therefore we did see

03:30.730 --> 03:36.340
it they user with my user name is Max and this is our own component being used.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.280
Now let's have a look at option 2 and some other things and the next lecture.
