End the last lecture we learn how we can use props and that's nice but distilled doesn't make our button

00:09.440 --> 00:09.950
work.

00:10.820 --> 00:16.820
To make this button work we need to write our component in a different way because now we want to use

00:16.880 --> 00:23.390
state art components should have its own state and state simply means whilst props are only set from

00:23.420 --> 00:30.740
outside and therefore not changeable inside of the component state is state can be set and changed from

00:30.800 --> 00:32.390
inside to component.

00:32.750 --> 00:36.360
So to you state we can't use this function for it.

00:36.520 --> 00:42.350
Instead we need to use the class keyword the iOS 6 Klasky were to create a new class which will name

00:42.380 --> 00:43.250
app.

00:43.400 --> 00:50.300
This class needs to extend our Riak package and their D component class which is provided by the package

00:50.750 --> 00:57.800
does component class provide some base functionality which you will need and then this class needs to

00:57.800 --> 01:02.100
have at least one function which is to render method here.

01:02.270 --> 01:09.620
Now render will be called bioreactor yes to render something to the dorm they have for the render method

01:09.620 --> 01:12.980
needs to do the same as our function here it needed to do.

01:12.980 --> 01:18.890
It needs to return to J as X code which is responsible for what this component should display.

01:18.890 --> 01:20.800
So let's return this year.

01:20.990 --> 01:22.800
I can remove my function now.

01:23.150 --> 01:29.440
And of course props like this won't work anymore because we don't have a prop's object in there anymore.

01:29.720 --> 01:35.760
But do you react Capone and give us a prop's property in that class.

01:35.960 --> 01:41.510
If that's totally new to you think about over Object Orientated languages you might know your classes

01:41.510 --> 01:43.460
may have properties and methods.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.430
We have to custom render method.

01:45.650 --> 01:52.670
But since he acts tente react component we also have access to a built in property so we can use this

01:52.670 --> 02:00.260
props to access as props property provided by re-act again a six course might be a good thing if you

02:00.260 --> 02:04.820
want to dive deeper into react and really fully understand what happened here.

02:04.820 --> 02:11.240
So with that we access this props property which is given to us by we act and react will also fill this

02:11.240 --> 02:12.180
property.

02:12.290 --> 02:17.910
Does props property with all the properties we set up on our component tag.

02:18.050 --> 02:26.300
So if I had control enter again we still see what we saw before but now with the ESX syntax we're very

02:26.300 --> 02:29.470
close to making this button work again in the next lecture.

02:29.510 --> 02:34.400
Let's dive into state and see how state helps us make this bottom work.
