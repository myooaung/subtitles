Welcome to this Marchal we already had a look at the UK US and we already had a look at re-act us and

00:09.330 --> 00:14.910
we will have a module where I compared them all and hopefully give you some help in deciding which one

00:14.910 --> 00:19.620
you choose if you don't know that already maybe because you feel that you like some more than yabber

00:20.280 --> 00:26.880
But before you make that decision let's have a look at angular the third framework I want to cover in

00:26.880 --> 00:33.150
this course because with it a singular react and view these are the three most popular and modern frameworks

00:33.150 --> 00:34.920
you can learn as of today.

00:35.340 --> 00:42.450
Angular probably is the most hyped one because it has Odigo strangely successful first part a singular

00:42.450 --> 00:50.310
one which was released 2012 and therefore angular as it is also backed by Google has a huge fan base

00:50.550 --> 00:52.700
and base of developers working with it.

00:52.770 --> 00:55.930
Nonetheless that doesn't automatically make it the right choice.

00:55.940 --> 01:01.540
Yabber friend books are great too but let's dive into the basics of a singular in this module.

01:01.590 --> 01:05.490
So did you see how it works and what you can do with it.
