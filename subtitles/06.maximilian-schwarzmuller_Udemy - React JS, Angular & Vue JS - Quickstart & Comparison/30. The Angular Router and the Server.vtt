00:02.760 --> 00:08.040
Now here's one thing I mentioned in the view Marchal and Andy re-act Marshall but it is important if

00:08.040 --> 00:12.440
you go to block you'll see the l is localhost four thousand two hundred.

00:12.450 --> 00:18.750
So your domain and that just Flashblock That's a nice view or else style in the style you want to use.

00:18.900 --> 00:25.620
However if you deploy this app to a real server this Eurail will get passed by the server forest all

00:25.620 --> 00:26.370
the time.

00:26.370 --> 00:27.670
That's just how the web works.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.580
And the same is true for our development server here.

00:29.580 --> 00:37.620
By the way now your server needs to be set up in a way anti-development sir is to always return the

00:37.620 --> 00:43.340
index HVM a file if it recognizes your l it doesn't understand.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.760
So if it basically froze 0 4 0 for error.

00:47.190 --> 00:54.780
This then allows a to take over NTIA angler router to kick in and to route to the correct component

00:54.990 --> 00:57.230
because the server of course doesn't know it.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.150
That's just something you have to keep in mind.

00:59.220 --> 01:06.750
If you deploy the app make sure your server returns to index HMO file in case of 4 0 4 errors.
