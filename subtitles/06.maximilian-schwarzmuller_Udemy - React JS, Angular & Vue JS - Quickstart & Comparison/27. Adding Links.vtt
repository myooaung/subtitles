00:02.760 --> 00:06.900
In the last lecture we set up routeing and we've got a route to work.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.730
We learned that we load the component in the place where we define the route and therefore we could

00:11.730 --> 00:15.000
use that router in Avro components too of course.

00:14.990 --> 00:22.170
Now I want to set up some links for that or add a horizontal line above that line a number def which

00:22.170 --> 00:23.840
will hold Rieslings.

00:23.940 --> 00:30.130
I'm already importing link so I can simply used the link component and set the two parameter.

00:30.240 --> 00:34.910
Here I could say link to slash should be like that.

00:34.920 --> 00:40.530
It shouldn't be a self-closing component here though because in between the link I want to say.

00:40.530 --> 00:41.820
Home for example.

00:42.040 --> 00:47.000
Now duplicators to also create a link to slash account and to slash block.

00:47.100 --> 00:54.480
So basically to the pauvres as set up down there and then I could say a count here and block here and

00:54.480 --> 00:55.530
now if I saved as.

00:55.530 --> 01:00.100
Again with does NPM start process still running.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.360
We see we got a couple of links there.

01:02.420 --> 01:08.560
Not really nicely separated but working to click on them we can navigate around.

01:08.660 --> 01:14.480
So what it will do here is I will add some pipe symbols ofter the links to have some separation in there

01:14.960 --> 01:21.710
so that we don't have all these links directly on or next to each other and with that it's a bit easier

01:21.710 --> 01:22.570
to read.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.120
Well doesn't win a stalled prize here but that's not the purpose of this exercise.

01:27.470 --> 01:34.070
And we get a working basic router with links with places to load routes and the definition of which

01:34.070 --> 01:41.000
road should be loaded in this place and that is the starting point of creating a single page application

01:41.000 --> 01:44.360
which still allows the user to switch between multiple routes.
