WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:09.710
So we built a basic app and we're putting data in our controlled defuser just as a side note if you

00:09.710 --> 00:16.340
add curly braces name outside of the Stiv you see just call the braces name here because this part here

00:16.400 --> 00:18.640
is not controlled by Eugenia's.

00:18.890 --> 00:27.770
Of course we don't only want to output things we also want to react to input so we could have this name

00:27.980 --> 00:30.140
be wrapped into a paragraph

00:34.170 --> 00:37.620
like this and also have a button.

00:37.710 --> 00:43.390
And here we could say change name and now we want to react to a change in name.

00:43.650 --> 00:50.280
For this we need to listen to an event and view chess gives us a directive instruction we can place

00:50.340 --> 00:53.960
in the template here which is named V on.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.870
That's just a command view chess recognises which tells you chess.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.630
OK I want to listen to some event.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.300
If you want to listen to.

01:02.430 --> 01:08.360
Then has to be passed as an argument which is done by adding colon and then the name of the event.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.040
And here all medieval javascript events are supported like mouse enter mouse leave.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.520
And of course also click then between the quotation marks.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.050
We assign a value here.

01:19.200 --> 01:26.020
We have to tell you Chez What's the name of the method you want to execute and we don't have any methods

01:26.030 --> 01:26.860
here.

01:26.930 --> 01:36.840
Now important Methot does not mean any javascript function here like change name this function can't

01:36.840 --> 01:42.180
be targeted from within view Chia's or from within the template at least.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.420
Instead we have to stay in the view chess world.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.050
We have to stay in that beauteous instance.

01:48.180 --> 01:52.050
And besides having data which we can output or manipulate.

01:52.050 --> 01:58.440
I also want to have a methods object where we register all the functions we basically want to execute

01:58.440 --> 02:01.140
from within our view Chia's world.

02:01.140 --> 02:07.800
So here we could have changed name and that's normal javascript code again just a property and our methods

02:07.830 --> 02:11.370
object which is or which holds a function as a value.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.830
And in this function we now want to change this name.

02:15.930 --> 02:22.230
And as I mentioned in the Getting Started section you chase gives us a magical way of accessing any

02:22.230 --> 02:26.950
data or method or whatever we have in our view instance.

02:27.030 --> 02:35.010
Normally if you were to write this name this would fail because this would not refer to our view instance

02:35.010 --> 02:42.840
to our view instance object and even if it would the name is part of the state object but upon creation

02:42.960 --> 02:50.790
view Che's merge has all our data properties all methods and some other things into a global instance

02:50.790 --> 02:55.690
object and it gives us easy access to this object with this.

02:55.860 --> 03:03.960
So this name will actually refer to the data name here and we can simply change name to Anna here and

03:03.960 --> 03:07.060
if we do so and we had control enter.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.280
If I click Change name.

03:09.300 --> 03:16.140
Of course nothing happens because we now have to connect our created method here to our click listener.

03:16.140 --> 03:22.510
So here we simply pass change name without parentheses just a reference to this function.

03:22.640 --> 03:28.280
And if I had control enter now and I now click Change name you see this change to.

03:28.650 --> 03:31.950
And that happens because Mujeres executed this method.

03:31.950 --> 03:39.780
The method changed name viewed as a recognized that name was changed and it recognized that the output

03:39.810 --> 03:43.200
name so it changed disp part of the dorm.

03:43.200 --> 03:50.460
Only this part not the whole Dom only this part and I updated it to deaders how we can listen to user

03:50.460 --> 03:54.620
input and how view chaced then reacts to changes like DS.
