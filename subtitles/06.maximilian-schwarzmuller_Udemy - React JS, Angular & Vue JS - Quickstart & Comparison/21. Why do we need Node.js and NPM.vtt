00:02.360 --> 00:07.000
For the next lecture where we will use the views Seelye we will need note.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.210
J.S. No no chases of course is a server side language so you might ask why do we need that.

00:13.250 --> 00:19.820
We're not going to write any service side code but no what yes happens to be used as a development server

00:20.230 --> 00:21.760
by the U.S. ally.

00:21.770 --> 00:27.150
More on that in this module on local workflows web peg and so on.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.630
And it's only needed so that we have a little development test server running on our local machine which

00:32.630 --> 00:34.370
will host our application.

00:34.580 --> 00:40.340
We need such a server instead of just double clicking the HD mail file because if we DoubleClick it

00:40.400 --> 00:43.980
we're going to use the file protocol if we have a development server.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.380
We're using the HTP protocol which you want.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.870
That's the more realistic testing environment because if you reach out to a real web page you're going

00:50.870 --> 00:59.960
to use HTP to additionally know Chase ships with NPM nodes package manager and it has this to NPM which

00:59.960 --> 01:05.850
you will use to install the Selye and also to manage all the dependencies of the project.

01:05.870 --> 01:09.770
So Overpeck is the project needs to run correctly.

01:09.950 --> 01:15.920
It will get installed automatically NPM will get installed automatically if you install no chairs so

01:15.950 --> 01:16.250
on.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.560
Note JSL org.

01:17.660 --> 01:23.300
Make sure to pick the latest Worsham here and then simply walk through the installer and that will do

01:23.300 --> 01:28.640
everything you need and thereafter you will have no checks and NPM installed and you are going to continue

01:28.640 --> 01:29.670
with the next lecture.
