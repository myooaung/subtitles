In the last lecture we implemented the routing the routes the router module and ultra ultra low drought's.

00:09.850 --> 00:16.640
But probably we also want to navigate for that in app component or add a def which should hold some

00:16.640 --> 00:23.330
router links and for that we use normal anger or attacks but I remove the ref attribute instead instead

00:23.430 --> 00:30.640
at the router link directive and here I don't set up square brackets because I simply pass a string

00:30.940 --> 00:35.160
and a shortcut for that simply using a string like this.

00:35.170 --> 00:41.350
Now you could wrap it in square brackets though and then simply pass a string between single quotation

00:41.350 --> 00:46.160
marks since whatever you have between the double quotation marks will now be interpreted that dynamically.

00:46.180 --> 00:51.110
So it would look for a property named bulldog instead was the string you entered.

00:51.100 --> 00:56.860
So I will admit the square Bechet sort of Them am able to use a shorter style of just having blague

00:56.860 --> 00:57.640
here.

00:57.670 --> 00:59.830
However the first round should just be slash.

00:59.830 --> 01:03.200
My route route and here I want to go home.

01:04.160 --> 01:11.380
Here of course I want to go to the blog and for the last one slash account I want to go to account.

01:11.540 --> 01:17.990
Of course the paths you define here have to match the paths you set up here just with a slash in front

01:17.990 --> 01:23.090
of them to make them absolute pauvres so that they replace the existing pot completely each time you

01:23.090 --> 01:25.390
click on one of these links.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.200
Now with that if we save this you'll see we have links at the top.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.140
Not super pretty but a trip to the chart.

01:32.150 --> 01:39.530
If you click on them we can switch between our pages just nice and that is how we can implement a very

01:39.530 --> 01:41.750
very basic routing functionality.

01:41.750 --> 01:47.170
Of course the router just like all the regular package just has to offer a lot more.

01:47.240 --> 01:53.540
But for this basic first introduction this should give you a nice impression of what you can do with

01:53.540 --> 01:54.010
it.
