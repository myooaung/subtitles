In the last lecture you learned what a genius X is.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.990
But right now we have a very static content here.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.390
Now what if we want to change named anemically.

00:12.520 --> 00:19.060
Let's say we have a constant name which has a string Max and we want to output this constant in this

00:19.060 --> 00:19.880
element.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.230
Nothing easier than that we can do this.

00:22.630 --> 00:31.240
But unlike view chess you don't use double curly braces but single Akali braces that's shust how it

00:31.240 --> 00:37.210
is and react and that is all of course connected to the fact that we already are in javascript code

00:37.210 --> 00:38.190
here.

00:38.410 --> 00:41.550
Here we can simply reference name like this.

00:41.560 --> 00:46.460
We could also call a method which returns a string here just like you do it in beauteous.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.620
And now for your control enter.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.290
We still see Max.

00:50.290 --> 00:52.340
But now that is a bit more dynamic.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.650
It's not hard coded into the element.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.880
Instead we're referring to a variable in this case which holds the stator.

01:00.260 --> 01:06.060
However we will quickly hit a wall if we try to change this dynamically.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.590
Well let's have a look at this in the next lecture.

01:08.590 --> 01:16.000
And let's then see how real Actually as actually works with the Dom and works with the content with

01:16.430 --> 01:18.160
X you output there.
