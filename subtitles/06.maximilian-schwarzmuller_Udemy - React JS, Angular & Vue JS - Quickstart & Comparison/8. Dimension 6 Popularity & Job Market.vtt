WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:04.480
Of course it's difficult.

00:04.540 --> 00:08.720
How do you measure popularity of frameworks.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.790
There are a lot of things you could have a look at.

00:10.840 --> 00:18.670
He could look at Google Trends You could look at posts and questions on Stack Overflow an hour our things.

00:18.670 --> 00:25.660
Now I decided to take the good herb statistics like stars and contra Buderus into account to measure

00:25.660 --> 00:27.670
how popular the project.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.550
All of these frameworks are open source projects.

00:30.610 --> 00:33.500
So how popular the projects are.

00:33.620 --> 00:36.910
I'll also have a look at who is backing the project.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.480
So which company is standing behind each framework.

00:40.480 --> 00:46.330
That of course also is important to get a feeling on how the future of this framework will look.

00:46.360 --> 00:53.080
We'll have a look at what is being built with this framework and finally how does the job market look

00:53.080 --> 00:53.590
like.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.640
So let's start with get help.

00:55.770 --> 00:57.720
Here is the angle or get half page.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.770
And if we have a look at it but there are a lot of things we could dive into but we can see that we

01:02.770 --> 01:10.420
have 23000 276 stars and 428 contributors.

01:10.420 --> 01:16.140
So there are a lot of contributors working on that framework and a lot of people are liking it.

01:16.330 --> 01:22.870
But let's now see how that is for viewed shares and react on The View Chaske get up page we can see

01:22.870 --> 01:24.580
something very interesting.

01:24.610 --> 01:29.070
We get to way more stars more than double the amount angler has.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.380
Here we get fifty thousand seven hundred eighty seven stars at the point of time I'm recording this.

01:34.390 --> 01:36.120
So WAY more stars.

01:36.190 --> 01:38.900
However we get only 90 free contributions.

01:38.950 --> 01:41.350
So which sense does this make.

01:41.350 --> 01:43.330
Why is chess so much popular.

01:43.330 --> 01:48.270
Is it bad or is it so much more hyped than anger.

01:48.370 --> 01:55.540
What well may be hyped is the correct word but that is kind of negative too deep project itself is extremely

01:55.540 --> 01:56.280
popular.

01:56.290 --> 02:01.110
That is true but we see that not that many people are contributing to it.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.760
So it's a smaller base of developers working on it.

02:04.840 --> 02:10.340
I think it's certainly safe to say that Engler is more popular overall.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.320
You can also check Google Trends to see the way more people are searching for Angle or tube or Ingela

02:15.340 --> 02:24.690
for then for view chess but chess is liked by developers developers following open source projects.

02:24.820 --> 02:29.430
So it might have a great future and it already is used a lot too.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.150
Don't get me wrong but get all stars are in everything.

02:33.250 --> 02:37.210
However we do see few chance certainly is liked by people.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.750
How about react now if the wizard reacts.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.520
Get her page here at Facebook react.

02:43.540 --> 02:48.240
We see that more people are storing it than view chess.

02:48.460 --> 02:55.580
Sixty four thousand seven hundred ninety and that we get a lot of contributions 984.

02:55.840 --> 03:00.230
So if you were to only look at dead re-act would be our clear winner.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.450
More stars more contribution.

03:02.500 --> 03:09.010
So a very active community and a lot of people liking it and that kind of is also the theme of react.

03:09.010 --> 03:16.020
It's developed by the community a lot whereas angler has its own team and community members and VTES

03:16.130 --> 03:19.730
simply isn't that big it's pretty new too.

03:20.200 --> 03:26.640
So again this is not the only thing we should look at but we can see that reactor's really popular here.

03:26.860 --> 03:29.560
So let's compare these results.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.770
Here are the numbers we just saw next to each other.

03:32.770 --> 03:34.670
And again let me point this out.

03:34.690 --> 03:36.220
This is not everything you should look at.

03:36.220 --> 03:41.980
It's not like re-access the winner and then view chess as the next best and no one is liking angler.

03:42.130 --> 03:48.190
It just shows how trending that is and that a lot of people which are involved in the open source community

03:48.370 --> 03:51.960
seem to be very interested in these projects of course.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.500
Again we also have to look at some other measures.

03:54.700 --> 04:00.510
For example how often is the framework used in real projects.

04:00.790 --> 04:06.720
Now I'd love to show you more here but it's not that easy to find out which page uses which frame work

04:06.980 --> 04:14.470
and all that we have to keep in mind that a single or two and now four and the chairs are pretty new.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.350
So we don't have that many web pages already using these.

04:18.400 --> 04:27.380
I can tell you however that for England for example the NBA is building its league pass its season pass.

04:27.460 --> 04:35.110
You can view any game online portal with Engler and I can tell you that Google is migrating pretty much

04:35.170 --> 04:43.000
all of its services like add words or all the Abra services they have to angler which is a big thing.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.430
So really a lot of big applications.

04:45.490 --> 04:53.590
Switching to Engler for you I can also point you to an official blocked post by the creator of the future.

04:53.590 --> 04:58.590
Yes and yes this is mostly one person so that's pretty amazing no big team.

04:58.660 --> 05:04.990
And in this blog post which of course has to be read with care because it's the creator of view he mentions

05:05.140 --> 05:06.940
which companies are using View.

05:06.940 --> 05:13.750
And here we get some big companies Asian companies mostly as of now which are switching to you you can

05:13.750 --> 05:21.460
see some here and I'm pretty sure we will see more companies using View in the future but we don't have

05:21.460 --> 05:24.450
the same traction angler will soon have.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.510
And as you will see in a second reaction has already has.

05:28.510 --> 05:35.470
If you're searching for a site spelled with React J.S. you'll find this entry on the official re-act

05:35.470 --> 05:40.360
wiki on get habbe which lists a lot of pages using a re-act chase.

05:40.360 --> 05:49.720
Now this is ordered in random order but here you will see for example of course Facebook because Facebook

05:49.720 --> 05:55.330
is the creator of re-act that they are using it on their page I guess is a pretty good proof of that

05:55.330 --> 05:57.320
it works on big pages.

05:57.370 --> 06:04.870
We also can see that Instagram also uses chairs and feel free to scroll through the list to see that

06:04.870 --> 06:11.470
a lot of pages are using actually has to well to work.

06:11.470 --> 06:15.160
Now again keep in mind angler two and four and Mujeres are pretty new.

06:15.160 --> 06:21.110
If you were to include a or one into this you would see that a lot of pages are using annular or one

06:21.190 --> 06:27.760
for example out of Google pages but also a lot of our pages and therefore Englert you or now for alls

06:27.770 --> 06:33.280
is pretty likely to become popular in the future and that it will be used on a lot of pages.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.700
So right now reaction is the winner here.

06:35.710 --> 06:38.190
But again the Framus are pretty new.

06:38.260 --> 06:41.940
And if we have a look at Anglo one to angler it doesn't look that bad.

06:42.760 --> 06:48.460
Now who's backing these frameworks who's developing them for angler this is Google.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.050
Oh that's not too bad.

06:50.050 --> 06:53.490
I guess this tells us something about the future of this framework.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.880
It's getting used by Google of course and we get a decent sized team working on it.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.900
We've probably got some people who know what they're doing.

07:01.120 --> 07:06.780
And overall I guess that's a strong reason to go with Angel or having Google in the back.

07:06.850 --> 07:09.490
That's not too bad for you.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.990
It's mostly one person.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.380
This guy even you.

07:12.430 --> 07:13.960
And he's done an amazing job.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.070
Now he's not doing it alone.

07:15.070 --> 07:17.400
There are other contributions as you saw.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.940
But still it's no big company standing behind view chairs.

07:21.970 --> 07:25.890
It's worth noting that even you worked at Google in the past though.

07:25.930 --> 07:30.670
So certainly a talented guy and I guess he more proof that with VHS.

07:30.820 --> 07:37.930
But the downside for you just might be that we don't have a big company standing behind it at least

07:37.930 --> 07:43.720
not now it's gaining traction however however we saw some big Chinese companies ends on are working

07:43.720 --> 07:50.640
with it and for example also legible APHC framework is strongly advocating view.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.290
So it's getting traction.

07:52.290 --> 07:57.650
It's just not there yet and it certainly doesn't have Google behind it for react.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.070
Will they get Facebook all not too bad.

08:00.070 --> 08:07.540
I guess so re-act an angler clear winners here have the biggest backers view has a strong community

08:07.630 --> 08:10.210
talented guy working on it talented team.

08:10.210 --> 08:16.840
Now I should say and it's gaining traction but doesn't have the same support Diablo to framework's have.

08:17.080 --> 08:23.050
Now how does the job perspective look like there are a thousand ways of measuring the jobs which are

08:23.050 --> 08:27.150
available for a frame work and I don't have a single source of truth here.

08:27.160 --> 08:34.180
What it did do is I went to India dot com and did search for some keywords there to find out how many

08:34.180 --> 08:37.770
jobs for a given framework were listed there.

08:37.780 --> 08:42.900
Now as of the end of April for Engler two or four.

08:42.910 --> 08:44.600
These were the search terms I used.

08:44.710 --> 08:53.520
I have found 674 jobs which were kind of referring to that for future as for searching for view.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.480
Jails or just view chairs.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.000
I found one hundred and eighty three and four.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.880
Yet searching for yakked dot chase or react.

09:02.890 --> 09:07.080
J.S. I found more than three thousand jobs.

09:07.090 --> 09:14.440
It's also worth mentioning that if I were to search for angler K-S or angler dot JSE which mostly refers

09:14.440 --> 09:20.770
to angler one I found more than 12000 chops so angler very popular.

09:20.770 --> 09:27.910
Again the difference to react to difference between angular Q4 and re-act probably related to the fact

09:27.910 --> 09:35.290
that angler's is still pretty new view or as does have a nice number of chops but certainly there is

09:35.290 --> 09:41.900
a big gap between the frameworks so that vantage could be that if you know chess you're filling in the

09:41.910 --> 09:42.390
ish.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.130
Not that many jobs but all is not the people who know huge areas.

09:47.140 --> 09:50.740
On the other hand the pool of jobs is smaller.

09:50.740 --> 09:57.700
Now we will see how that develops and I personally strongly believe that view chess has a great future

09:57.760 --> 10:00.490
because the framework is just very nice.

10:00.640 --> 10:06.640
Has some nice design decisions but as of now react is the winner.

10:06.850 --> 10:09.880
And if you including a one angler doesn't look too bad.

10:09.880 --> 10:18.190
And again angler probably due to the backing and the popular first part of it and the one also has a

10:18.190 --> 10:20.440
bright future for view.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.770
It's less clear but probably also not that bad.

10:23.980 --> 10:29.860
So this is the popularity of the framework and the impression on how easy or tough it might be to get

10:29.860 --> 10:30.840
a job.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.090
And then again it's up to you to use that information.

10:34.090 --> 10:35.920
Does it matter to you.

10:35.980 --> 10:41.720
Do you believe that filling the view knish might be a big chance it might be.

10:41.950 --> 10:45.590
Or is it important for you that you have a lot of jobs right now.

10:45.670 --> 10:48.270
Well that strongly speaks for it.

10:48.640 --> 10:54.850
So use that information to make your decision and use it to gather with all the ABA aspects.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.000
We did have a look at.

10:56.170 --> 11:02.870
Well speaking of that let's fill out the table so we had a look at some measures of popularity and the

11:02.890 --> 11:04.850
job market for the framework's.

11:04.900 --> 11:07.620
Let's now complete our big picture here.

11:07.630 --> 11:08.920
How about Engler.

11:09.220 --> 11:10.700
Well it's a plus.

11:10.700 --> 11:17.650
However it's not super awesome right now but I'm sure we will see more jobs in the future and popularity

11:17.650 --> 11:19.090
is going to get stronger.

11:19.090 --> 11:27.100
It already is gaining a lot of traction and I'm sure it will surpass its very popular first part Anglo

11:27.130 --> 11:28.830
one in the future.

11:28.870 --> 11:30.720
Not there yet though.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.030
Now how about you.

11:32.170 --> 11:37.630
Well it's going to be an equal sign here for me and if the chopper is back that is super super important

11:37.630 --> 11:45.160
to you and you need a big pool of jobs that might even a minus because that's the big disadvantage of

11:45.220 --> 11:45.780
you.

11:45.910 --> 11:47.060
It's very popular.

11:47.080 --> 11:52.570
It's very trending and it's gaining a lot of traction more and more companies are using it.

11:52.570 --> 11:58.450
But it doesn't have the same amount of backing and of jobs as the average two frameworks have.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.550
So it might become better in the future.

12:01.570 --> 12:07.780
And again I strongly believe that if you Chess has a big future but at the point of time really looking

12:07.780 --> 12:18.880
at it right now Matt 2017 probably also early 2018 does might not be the place it should be.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.850
How about react.

12:19.870 --> 12:22.060
Well that's a clear plus lots of jobs.

12:22.120 --> 12:27.140
Very popular certainly backed by a big company Facebook.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.620
So that's looking great.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.320
Daises the fold out table.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.540
What's the final word 9:54.
