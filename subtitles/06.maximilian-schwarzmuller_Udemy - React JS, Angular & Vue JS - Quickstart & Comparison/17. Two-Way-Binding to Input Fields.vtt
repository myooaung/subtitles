We're almost done with the first part of the section and I can imagine that your head is almost exploding

00:09.540 --> 00:15.180
before coming to a practice section so that you can practice the things you learned.

00:15.360 --> 00:20.850
There's one thing we haven't covered yet and that is how we can actually fetch user input.

00:20.880 --> 00:26.880
We can listen to events but there is something we already did in the Getting Started section which we

00:26.880 --> 00:32.640
didn't have a look at in this section yet and that is what if we have an input field and we want to

00:32.640 --> 00:34.890
react to what the user enters.

00:34.950 --> 00:40.860
Let's do that in our second instance here let's say with input and we want to allow the user to dynamically

00:40.860 --> 00:42.960
change the message here.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.090
Well that's super easy to do.

00:45.090 --> 00:52.800
We can use a number directive re model and the model allows us to set up two way binding and that simply

00:52.800 --> 01:00.440
means it outputs whatever we bind here has as a value as the value of this input.

01:00.630 --> 01:05.040
But whenever we change it it will also updated in our data.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.940
So here we have the message.

01:07.050 --> 01:10.640
If were buying the Model 2 message and I had control enter.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.540
You see Hello there.

01:12.610 --> 01:15.110
Here to this input field.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.320
That's the one direction of winding.

01:17.610 --> 01:22.520
But if I change this you'll see that it updates below the input field too.

01:22.620 --> 01:29.410
That's the direction of binding it recognizes this change and then automatically updates to updates

01:29.420 --> 01:36.120
the data property and also every place in this template where we used this property where we output

01:36.210 --> 01:39.120
this property like here with the Cauley braces.

01:39.210 --> 01:42.380
So we model two way data binding.

01:42.420 --> 01:48.960
Great if you have input fields where you want to react to whatever the user changes or what the user

01:49.050 --> 01:53.250
inputs and then dynamically update your data property to.
