00:02.390 --> 00:07.360
And The Last Lecture we create our first basic components you're using the function form.

00:07.420 --> 00:12.040
Now we don't really use the computer to its fullest potential.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.510
We want to output a name here.

00:13.570 --> 00:16.870
And right now the name is still stored and is variable.

00:16.870 --> 00:19.940
Now that is not really how you should use re-act components.

00:20.050 --> 00:25.570
If there is something in the component you want to set from outside like the name you should use a special

00:25.570 --> 00:34.540
construct prop's does function actually receives one argument passed into it by reject and I'll name

00:34.540 --> 00:39.640
this argument perhaps the name is up to you but that is the best description because it is object of

00:39.640 --> 00:42.340
properties set from outside.

00:42.340 --> 00:46.590
You may recall the concept of props from the view Chia's section.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.120
Well they're using the same here basically.

00:49.360 --> 00:56.890
I can now remove the name here and instead provide some properties on my components tacked on there

00:57.400 --> 01:04.090
so I could set name equal to a string Max and I could also use single Akali braces if you want to use

01:04.090 --> 01:09.250
something dynamic like call a function or anything like that which then returns the string in the end.

01:09.250 --> 01:09.900
So you're.

01:09.930 --> 01:11.250
That's Max.

01:11.260 --> 01:16.840
You could also pass two like this in single call braces if you want to pass something which is not a

01:16.840 --> 01:17.630
string.

01:17.830 --> 01:21.230
But again here I need a string so it's max for now.

01:21.610 --> 01:27.430
And now to use that of course here where an output name I should output Perhaps name.

01:27.590 --> 01:30.390
Andrew yes yes we'll do the mapping for us.

01:30.400 --> 01:37.720
We'll map this name property into this perhaps object so that we can access it with the name property

01:37.840 --> 01:39.350
on the prop's object.

01:39.520 --> 01:45.070
Fanout control ENTRAR we see the same as before but now using the component the way we should use it

01:45.280 --> 01:46.430
with props.

01:46.530 --> 01:49.100
However the button still doesn't work.
