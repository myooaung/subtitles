00:02.330 --> 00:07.940
Remembered a lecture where I told you to install note James because we needed for our local development

00:07.940 --> 00:14.780
server and because we need NPM both reasons are very important for many front end development workflows

00:14.810 --> 00:20.390
and actually know chairs is a must have if you're a front end developer even if you're never writing

00:20.390 --> 00:22.870
any note as server side code.

00:23.090 --> 00:28.760
You will still need no chairs because of the fact that you can host develop and service with it.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.700
More on this in the next lecture.

00:30.710 --> 00:37.010
And because of the fact that you get NPM notes package manager which is the de-facto package manager

00:37.160 --> 00:42.460
for managing dependencies off your projects let's have a look at these dependencies.

00:42.590 --> 00:46.240
They are always stored in the package started Jason File.

00:46.330 --> 00:48.530
And here we have some meta data about the project.

00:48.620 --> 00:55.480
But the two most important pieces here are the dependencies and the def dependencies dependencies managers

00:55.510 --> 00:58.900
all the penances we need for our app to run in the browser.

00:58.910 --> 01:04.710
So in our case your view into view router development dependencies are only needed during development.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.830
So here it would be web spec to build tool web.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.670
Def server does development server I will talk about in the next lecture at a couple of other Lowder's

01:13.670 --> 01:21.470
and configuration packages which are used by web peg so that we are able to use ESX babe who would be

01:21.470 --> 01:28.340
responsible for the compilation here that we are able to put SEUS code into our script files that you

01:28.430 --> 01:35.360
are able to use images and load them and that we are able to use these Dadda view files and it will

01:35.360 --> 01:37.070
come back to the Wepa configuration.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.620
One of the next lectures too.

01:38.870 --> 01:45.800
But daises what NPM does for us and NPM will then always install these packages in the node modules

01:45.800 --> 01:46.690
folder.

01:46.700 --> 01:54.740
The nice thing is if we share our project on get up for example we dont need to send this node modules

01:54.740 --> 01:55.670
folder to get up.

01:55.670 --> 02:00.840
We dont need to share that folder if we share the package touchiest and file.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.840
I can actually delete the node modules folder.

02:03.860 --> 02:12.520
So now all our dependencies are gone and therefore if I now run on Def we will get an error because

02:12.610 --> 02:17.530
view chases and found the view routers and phone WePay itself isnt found.

02:17.530 --> 02:23.260
But what I can now do is since I have this package truck chase file which clearly lists what I need

02:23.260 --> 02:30.730
and which weren't I needed I can run an install inside of this project without Dashti without anything

02:30.730 --> 02:31.370
else.

02:31.690 --> 02:37.600
And now it will automatically analyze as package just chase and file and download all the packet just

02:37.600 --> 02:44.020
mentioned there and put them in the node modules folder so that as soon as this is finished I can again

02:44.020 --> 02:51.110
run NPM or on dev or NPM or unbilled and successfully both my project dad has the advantage of the package

02:51.120 --> 02:58.200
Dutchesse and fall and of NPM a great way of managing your dependencies of being transparent which worsens

02:58.210 --> 03:02.330
you use and making sharing the project very very easy.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.310
NPM also allows you to define scripts as DS too.

03:06.350 --> 03:11.410
These are simple scripts which you can always execute with NPM run and then your script name like death

03:11.440 --> 03:12.640
or build.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.860
And this allows you to trigger some web workflow steps basically.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.570
For example NPM run death with spinup test.

03:19.570 --> 03:24.880
This development server to which I will come into next lecture and NPM run build will not spin up that

03:24.880 --> 03:30.940
server but only well run the normal build process to which I will come back once we have a closer look

03:30.940 --> 03:33.260
at the Wetpaint conflict file.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.100
So that is A.P.M. and no chairs.

03:35.110 --> 03:36.340
And why this really awesome.
