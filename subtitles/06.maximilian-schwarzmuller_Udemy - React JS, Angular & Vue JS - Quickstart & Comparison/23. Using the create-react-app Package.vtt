I'm on the isolation page and the official docs here and if we scroll to the very top we see this point

00:07.440 --> 00:10.200
creating a single page application.

00:10.200 --> 00:16.080
As a side note below that we see how we can add to an existing application which steps we have to follow

00:16.080 --> 00:18.170
and which tools we will need.

00:18.360 --> 00:25.650
And then it tells us how we can install these packages we need and how we can enable ESX and jazz acts

00:25.770 --> 00:26.810
with baseball.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.040
And that is something you will have to do to install baseball and to set up a workflow which runs your

00:32.040 --> 00:34.010
javascript code for cable.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.510
So I will go with the first approach which will enable us to quickly create a Riak project and that

00:39.510 --> 00:42.240
will simply execute the steps we see here.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.860
So first we will install a package globally on our machine just like we installed the views Seelye.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.790
So here at the command line I'll run sudo and that's only required on Mac and Linux and B.M. install

00:55.820 --> 01:04.460
that she'd to install it globally and then we create re-act app package create re-act app.

01:04.480 --> 01:11.760
Now I'm prompted to enter my password and once I did enter this correctly it installs this might take

01:11.760 --> 01:14.900
a bit longer for you because I already had it installed.

01:15.150 --> 01:20.640
With that you should navigate into the folder where you want to create your new re-act project and then

01:20.640 --> 01:25.320
you run create re-act app and then the name of your project which will also be the name of the folder

01:25.320 --> 01:26.510
which gets created.

01:26.550 --> 01:34.170
So create re-act app and now I'm going to name this re-act framework intro.

01:34.310 --> 01:40.040
This will now create a folder with some basic set up with the dependencies you need with the workflow

01:40.040 --> 01:47.690
the payable compiler everything you need so that you can get started building your single page re-act

01:47.690 --> 01:48.160
app.

01:48.170 --> 01:55.600
Now I will be back once this finishes Sodhi set up process just finished here and it also shows us the

01:55.610 --> 01:57.850
where little commands and how to continue.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.520
So we shall navigate into this folder next.

02:01.970 --> 02:08.810
So I just did this and now I can run NPM start in there to start the development server which will build

02:08.840 --> 02:12.420
our project and run it on this address here.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.690
It should open automatically.

02:14.690 --> 02:15.640
Here it is.

02:15.770 --> 02:17.230
And that is the basic app.

02:17.250 --> 02:19.710
This package created for us there.

02:19.730 --> 02:24.110
Now in the next lecture we'll have a look at what actually did get created for us.

02:24.350 --> 02:25.930
And then how we can work with that.

02:25.970 --> 02:32.450
And finally how we may add the router to make this a real single page application with multiple pages.
