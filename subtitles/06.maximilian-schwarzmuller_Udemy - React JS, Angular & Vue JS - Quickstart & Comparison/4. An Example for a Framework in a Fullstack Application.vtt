00:02.590 --> 00:08.410
Let's take you to me dot com as an X example every wisit this page here you'd have been dot com and

00:08.420 --> 00:11.110
I'm forwarded to slash courses.

00:11.110 --> 00:18.370
This is essentially a multi-page application because if I for example now search for Cingular here and

00:18.370 --> 00:20.780
hit enter you see the page refreshes.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.400
And we did load a new page.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.890
You could see that by the spinning refresh icon up there.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.950
So this now is the new page.

00:28.960 --> 00:36.820
We got back and if I were to click on browse development web development watchlist I can again we again

00:36.820 --> 00:42.820
we loaded a new page and we can confirm this by opening up the developer tools in our browser going

00:42.820 --> 00:44.300
to the network tap.

00:44.590 --> 00:51.640
And now if we click on browse development or mobile apps for example you will see we sent a couple of

00:51.640 --> 00:57.640
requests and we basically got back a new web page with a lot of assets in it.

00:57.670 --> 01:06.260
Now if I were to search for English again and hit enter again we download a brand new page and this

01:06.270 --> 01:09.640
is what happens all the time if we switch page this year.

01:09.790 --> 01:14.510
So that is the page we downloaded for example that's th HTML code we got back.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.680
That's a different page than the one we were at before.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.140
Now this is a normal web app.

01:20.140 --> 01:25.360
How do I know that it uses some framework because that's the point I'm trying to make that we can use

01:25.360 --> 01:30.230
a framework like view for example in such a multi-page application.

01:30.610 --> 01:35.980
Well obviously all these pages have some elements which are controlled by Javascript.

01:35.980 --> 01:43.600
So for example here on the search page where I searched for Cingular I can set a filter like the level

01:43.600 --> 01:45.500
I want to set to begin.

01:45.670 --> 01:50.160
Now if I click this it will update the page without reloading it.

01:50.170 --> 01:55.630
You can tell by that I can hear if I uncheck that you see it updates it but we don't get back on you

01:55.630 --> 02:02.110
page that's done by javascript because javascript is the only thing which can and at our page at runtime

02:02.920 --> 02:09.760
we can confirm that they use a framework for this by again going back to the network tab and reloading

02:09.760 --> 02:10.650
this page.

02:10.810 --> 02:14.430
Now isn't it a reload or that I download all the assets again.

02:14.530 --> 02:22.360
For that you might want to disable caching here so that you force the browser to read download all assets.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.690
Why did I want to read download everything.

02:24.850 --> 02:30.890
Because if we scroll up here in the Network tab we see something interesting relatively at the top here.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.350
This entry Wender file.

02:33.370 --> 02:39.090
You see it's a javascript file and it has this strange file name but that is just how de well-named

02:39.130 --> 02:40.820
during their build workflow.

02:41.110 --> 02:48.190
If we clicked this or by the way always implies that it is some framework some library not code written

02:48.190 --> 02:49.370
by them.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.090
If you click this we see something interesting in this file.

02:53.140 --> 03:00.080
Right at the top we see a license agreement angular 1.5 so angular one basically.

03:00.490 --> 03:06.700
Well that means they are using angular as a framework on this page and it makes sense because updating

03:06.720 --> 03:12.280
this list of results and all the things you can do on this page which are driven by javascript would

03:12.280 --> 03:16.850
be very cumbersome to be written by hand with vanilla javascript.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.750
But here again this angular app is only part of this search page.

03:21.760 --> 03:27.910
If I switch to here to finance courses for example I don't have to filter here.

03:27.910 --> 03:32.980
Maybe we have some angular appere maybe we have some shared functionalities to the previous one but

03:33.070 --> 03:35.310
we have a new angle app on this page.

03:35.310 --> 03:40.900
We have a different file here or a different code which will run in the end and that is what I mean

03:41.140 --> 03:47.430
we have an alert being added to our multi-page application with each new page I get here.

03:47.440 --> 03:54.730
I read download dangler code or my browser might cashiered for performance but generally it is served

03:54.730 --> 04:00.470
by each new page and therefore this is not a single page application.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.730
What is a single page application done.

04:03.110 --> 04:08.710
Well if I switch to my courses and you probably also have at least one course the when you are viewing

04:08.710 --> 04:09.630
right now.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.150
There you can see here are a couple of courses I'm enrolled in do.

04:13.390 --> 04:21.310
Now if I take one of these courses maybe the ruby course here and I click on it.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.070
Now we will basically enter a different type of app.

04:25.130 --> 04:27.110
Let's see which app in the next lecture.
