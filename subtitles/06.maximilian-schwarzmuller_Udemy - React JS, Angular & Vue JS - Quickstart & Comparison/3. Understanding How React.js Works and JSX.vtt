00:02.060 --> 00:05.750
In the last lecture we created our first basic re-act app.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.440
But that certainly looks strange.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.250
What is dead were in the script.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.260
Partir What does the HMS Echo do there.

00:13.770 --> 00:21.880
That's that special feature I was talking about J.S. X extension to javascript introduced by re-act

00:22.060 --> 00:29.000
which is enabled by the baseball tranced piler which allows us to write HTL ish code.

00:29.050 --> 00:35.510
It's not exactly T.M. as you will learn in javascript behind the scenes.

00:35.530 --> 00:41.580
This will be transported to something else and we can actually write this something else on our own.

00:41.860 --> 00:46.220
So I will just copy that and then comment that out for the moment.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.800
And added in there and now a ride.

00:50.830 --> 00:53.140
All right just differently.

00:53.140 --> 01:00.960
I will write this or I'll put it into a new element I'll add cons to your conses iOS 6 feature to define

01:00.970 --> 01:04.240
a variable which doesn't change if you don't feel confident using this.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.330
Just use var.

01:05.350 --> 01:10.180
But I recommend diving into iOS 6 if you want to go with react.

01:10.180 --> 01:16.930
So will create a new variable basically here which will name element the element of one output and this

01:17.020 --> 01:22.400
element now uses react and there create element.

01:22.420 --> 01:24.120
Notice we're not using react on.

01:24.130 --> 01:26.090
We're using this first inboard now.

01:26.170 --> 01:32.920
And they are the target element method which is provided to us by this package and create element takes

01:33.030 --> 01:35.000
three or more arguments.

01:35.020 --> 01:40.390
The first argument is the wrapping element and that is only one.

01:40.390 --> 01:46.080
You may have only one wrapping element but you may nest as many elements as you want inside of it.

01:46.360 --> 01:52.570
So here that would be p r paragraphed tag without lower than the greater than sign just a tag name.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.610
The second argument.

01:53.650 --> 01:58.300
Are the props we want to pass to this argument and it will come back to prop's later.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.650
Let's say now for now the first or all our arguments.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.510
You may have as many as you want.

02:04.600 --> 02:10.420
Are the children of this paragraph so your debts shust Max.

02:10.570 --> 02:12.220
Just a name.

02:12.370 --> 02:16.280
Now with this we can use element in here.

02:16.630 --> 02:20.740
So this constant and hit Control enter and see Max again.

02:21.040 --> 02:27.070
That is what this jazz X code gets transposed to this re-act create element method.

02:27.280 --> 02:33.690
But since this is not very intuitive to right and gets even more complex if you have more complex HVM

02:33.690 --> 02:38.040
all the code with nested elements inside of the paragraph and so on.

02:38.170 --> 02:45.040
I will use shape's X in this course and I strongly recommend that you do so to deciles is a key difference

02:45.040 --> 02:46.900
to view chaos there.

02:46.930 --> 02:53.610
We wrote our HMO code in the HCM out section and we only added some dynamic parts to it.

02:53.620 --> 02:56.350
Something will come back to in the next lectures here too.

02:56.770 --> 02:59.860
And then we were able to use debt in react.

02:59.890 --> 03:02.840
We write everything in javascript.

03:02.980 --> 03:06.860
We won't touched his aged female part for our re-act code anymore.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.150
We will stick to javascript and put our age.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.760
Tim L. X code in there too.

03:13.930 --> 03:14.920
That's the key difference.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.690
That's chest x and that's what I'll use.

03:17.890 --> 03:24.050
So I will simply comment this out comment does however change it also.

03:24.250 --> 03:33.070
I will instead say Konst aliment equals this paragraph which had an output down there with react on

03:33.080 --> 03:33.670
render.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.490
But if I had control enter this still works.

03:36.490 --> 03:42.610
Now let's see how we can also make this a bit more dynamic so that we don't have to hard code mix in

03:42.610 --> 03:43.090
there.
