It's time to practice all the things to learn about futures so that the basics of you chase are really

00:10.120 --> 00:11.530
set.

00:11.530 --> 00:17.240
Here are a couple of exercises prepared for you only things you'll learn thus far.

00:17.470 --> 00:23.260
I want you to start easy and create a death over which you then take control with a new instance.

00:23.360 --> 00:30.820
Learned all about dead as a second step I want you to output an array of hobbies as a list or an ordered

00:30.820 --> 00:31.090
list.

00:31.090 --> 00:39.610
Probably in this death and you might want to pre-populated your hobbies of some starting values.

00:40.120 --> 00:46.960
Then I want to add a new hobby button and the input field above this list where you fetch the value

00:46.960 --> 00:51.240
of the input list and add a new hobby with that value.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.860
Whenever desperateness clicked you can add validation to check whether the input is empty or not but

00:56.860 --> 00:58.630
that's purely optional.

00:59.140 --> 01:06.880
Then I want you to make these hobby's clickable so that once you did click one hobby is actually removed

01:06.880 --> 01:08.140
from the array.

01:08.950 --> 01:11.630
And then I want you to add a paragraph.

01:11.630 --> 01:18.760
Hubby delete it below the list maybe which is only shown once at least one hobby has been deleted.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.790
Be creative on how you may tractor's.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.780
Maybe you have some Boullion hobbie deleted which is falls initially and which you then set to Drewett

01:25.780 --> 01:29.080
some point of time thereafter.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.530
Add a hobby counter above the list of hobbies.

01:32.690 --> 01:37.900
This is simply a paragraph where you use string interpolation to output the number of hobbies you have

01:37.900 --> 01:38.940
in your array.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.510
And as a next step I want you to dynamically styled this counter.

01:43.510 --> 01:47.060
For example with dynamic styling and or dynamic.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.910
As class attachments to for example change to look of this paragraph.

01:51.910 --> 02:00.400
Whenever you have more or less and free hobby's finally take that Harbi code and put it into its own

02:00.400 --> 02:06.790
component so only the individual list items you loop through and make sure that everything still works.

02:06.790 --> 02:10.250
That's probably the most challenging step but you can do it.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.880
And the solution with you.

02:11.950 --> 02:17.710
I will show you my approach and hopefully then clear up some of the confusion if you are stuck at some

02:17.710 --> 02:18.650
of these points.
