Thus far in this all we always used.

00:05.560 --> 00:12.520
James Fedele simply because it's easy to use and we use this Cdn or DS CDN links here.

00:12.840 --> 00:18.810
There we kind of simulate the multi-page approach because even though we only used one just Fidele a

00:18.810 --> 00:26.580
window it's easy to imagine that this was one page off our web app which might have multiple pages I

00:26.580 --> 00:27.810
guess.

00:27.810 --> 00:36.390
Now I want to show you how to quickly set up a local re-act workflow which is also suited to create

00:36.390 --> 00:38.430
single page applications.

00:38.430 --> 00:45.930
Now of course you can also create multi-page applications with your local development workflow but there

00:46.170 --> 00:53.040
you typically need to have the integrated workflow with the project you're creating your back in with.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.730
So for example if you have a node.

00:54.750 --> 01:01.150
JS re-act application and you're creating a full stack multi-page application with no to chase.

01:01.410 --> 01:07.870
Well then you need to integrate that react part into your no Chia's views rendering anyways.

01:08.040 --> 01:13.260
So that is what I mean with integrated approach and that is something you will have to dive deeper into

01:13.380 --> 01:20.010
if you plan to learn reactivates when which is probably something you should get taught in a reaction

01:20.140 --> 01:20.990
of course.
