00:02.410 --> 00:06.340
In the last lecture we learned how we can dynamically set styles.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.190
You're with the bind style.

00:09.190 --> 00:12.840
We can also dynamically said C-s as classes.

00:13.300 --> 00:20.710
So what we can do here is we can define a new C S S class here and there could be updated and I want

00:20.710 --> 00:23.330
to attach this class to my name here.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.910
If we did change it.

00:25.270 --> 00:28.030
So that's a normal C S S class definition.

00:28.030 --> 00:34.910
And here I simply want to set the color to white boobs like this.

00:35.170 --> 00:39.010
And the background color again normalcy is as code here.

00:39.090 --> 00:46.770
Maybe two yellow now and one to attach just updated the class to this paragraph but only if we did update

00:46.770 --> 00:47.620
it.

00:47.620 --> 00:54.760
So I can again use the bind and Nele class and here just like we bind style.

00:54.760 --> 00:58.940
This takes a javascript object on does object.

00:59.080 --> 01:06.550
We now define as a property name which C has as Class B 1 to append so updated in this case.

01:06.550 --> 01:11.080
You could also put this into single quotation marks if you were using forbidden characters like the

01:11.080 --> 01:13.440
dash in the C S S name.

01:13.660 --> 01:17.980
And then as a value we have a condition which should be true or false.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.570
Deciding whether this is added or not.

01:20.830 --> 01:26.080
So here I'll just use the same condition as here where I showed this paragraph checking if the name

01:26.080 --> 01:27.400
has been changed.

01:27.490 --> 01:29.980
So this gives you back false or true.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.190
If I couldn't hit Control enter and then click Change name.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.500
Now it's yellow and white.

01:34.510 --> 01:37.240
So not very readable I guess.

01:37.240 --> 01:43.000
But you can clearly see that it did change this just because we updated the name.
