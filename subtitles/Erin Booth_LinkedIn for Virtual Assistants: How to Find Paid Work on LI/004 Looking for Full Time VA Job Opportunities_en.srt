1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:09,130
There are other ways to look for job listings, so if pitching a client like we just went through the

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:17,290
search bar lesson about using key phrases to find people who are hiring VAS, and if that is not your

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,880
cup of tea, I got you covered.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,100
Maybe instead of working with a client, you're interested in working as a VA for a company.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,220
That could mean you're hired as a contractor for a company, or maybe they even hire you as a full time

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,300
remote employee.

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,120
That would be cool, too, because you get benefits.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,690
Anything you choose is fine for your own company, but if a if a job listing or working with a company

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,770
sounds intriguing.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,180
Here's what we're going to do.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,110
We're going to navigate at the top of the page over two jobs.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,280
Now see here.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,120
LinkedIn smartly already knows that I am a virtual assistant, and they've recommended jobs for me,

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,050
which is cool.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,410
But just in case they don't do that, you can search for virtual assistant at the top bar.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,110
Then, of course, like everything else in LinkedIn, we can drill down into specific locations, even

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,930
by state.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,290
Oh my goodness, but I was thinking more country.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,720
So if you're based in the UK, for example, you can search for V jobs that are posted in the UK for

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,680
PlayStation.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,510
Oh my god, that is cool.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,850
OK, so a couple more things I want to do.

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,530
I want to dial down on recent job postings.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,110
Twenty thousand, I want to select my level.

25
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:40,060
If your brand new entry level is not about it here, I want to especially pay attention to on site,

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,960
remote or hybrid.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,920
So as a VA, you're likely going to want a fully remote job.

28
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:53,830
So LinkedIn will actually help by completing the jobs that are fully remote and that were recently posted.

29
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:01,150
So I can see here there's over 1100 jobs for a virtual assistant with companies that I can apply for.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,280
So if you do see something that you're interested in, you're like, Oh, OK, tell talent to fi and

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,100
you're looking through here and here.

32
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,480
It aligns with the time zone and you like everything that they're listing out and you're feeling good

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,480
about the administrative duties that they're listing for you.

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,480
You can go ahead and click Apply.

35
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,620
It really is as simple as that will want to make sure that we have this toggled on.

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,360
So make sure again, before you even get to this point in the course that you've really gone through

37
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,390
early on in the course and you've put a banner up there, put a nice profile photo out of the video,

38
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:41,680
you've got your title down to a really concise and clear tagline and you're about your summary is great,

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,470
which I want to make sure that the basics are there so that when we apply your profile, it will be

40
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,770
shared automatically with the recruiter and then we go through the process of actually applying for

41
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,190
the job.

42
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,070
Something else I want to point out, by the way, that if you scroll down and you see basic requirements

43
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,350
or education requirements, I'm going to let you in on a much needed secret that we all frankly need

44
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,730
to be talking about a lot more.

45
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,040
If, for example, you are looking at the requirements and you're like, You know what?

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,920
I don't quite fit all the requirements.

47
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,060
Forget about it.

48
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,870
Don't worry about it.

49
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,430
I want you to apply anyway.

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,600
I don't want you to tell yourself, no, that you're not qualified for my job.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,140
I want the recruiter to tell you that you might not be qualified for a job.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,920
So if you're interested in a job that you're like, I know I can do this, I might not be able to provide

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,230
marketing assistant experience, but everything else I've got, I want you to apply for it anyway.

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,960
Worst case scenario, they say, No, you're not qualified.

55
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,140
Best case scenario, they speak to you anyway.

56
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,790
Better case scenario.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,070
They have another job opportunity for you in mind, but it is a great idea to use this job section to

58
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,560
also hone in and kind of package your work as a virtual assistant to so freelance clients are great.

59
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,540
Job listings with companies are great, both are great, and you can find both of those options here

60
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,110
on LinkedIn.

61
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,810
So your homework at the end of this video, which is just about wrapping up, is to look through the

62
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,960
jobs section on your own profile and see if anything sticks out.

63
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,810
See if there's anything that you're interested in.

64
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,790
See if there's anything that you could apply for today, and why not apply for it right now?

65
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,140
What do you have to lose?

66
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,490
Absolutely nothing.
