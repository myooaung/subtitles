1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,640
Now's the time to talk about one of my most favorite features of LinkedIn, and that is prospecting

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,230
for clients.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,760
So unbeknownst to many, I think LinkedIn is actually a fantastic place to look for clients and we can

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,190
get a specific or general as we want.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,500
But for this example, I'm going to keep it fairly specific so I can show you how it works.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,820
There are two main ways that we can look for clients.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,690
Let's start with the easier of the two, and that would be to search for people who are already actively

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,130
looking for assistance.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,800
So this search bar up here is a lot like Google search, and I think not a lot of people realize that,

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
but this thing is a goldmine.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,230
And the more specific you are in your search terms, the better.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,880
So I'm going to start off by searching for seeking help, seeking help.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,330
That's not what I'm seeking.

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,260
Seeking virtual assistant.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,830
OK.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:16,230
So I'm have typed in this phrase and you'll see me right here, but I want to get a little more specific

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,220
with my search results.

18
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,050
By the way, if you've noticed right off the bat, there are people who have posted six hours ago,

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,910
two days ago that are seeking virtual assistants, so I already am winning.

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,780
But I want to get a little more specific so we can look up here.

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:41,010
These are our filters and these are going to help us really drill down and to find specifics that kind

22
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,590
of coincide with what exactly we're looking for.

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,690
All right.

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,270
So I can simply look for posts that are seeking virtual assistants.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,180
So as we scroll down, we'll see all these people are looking for VAS, which is awesome because there

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,410
are endless job opportunities right here in and of itself.

27
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:09,270
What we can do is posted by posted by a first connection is somebody that you are directly connected

28
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,539
with.

29
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,890
So if you and I are connected on LinkedIn as friends, you and I will be first connections if your mom

30
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,850
joins LinkedIn.

31
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,870
Your mother would be a second connection to me.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,380
It's because she has a connection to you.

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,640
But your mom and I aren't necessarily friends on LinkedIn and so on and so forth.

34
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,700
So I like to keep this net open when I'm searching for job opportunities.

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,120
I don't keep it limited to my first connections because I want to cast a wider net.

36
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,550
And more often than not, it's people that I'm not already connected with who are seeking assistance

37
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,200
like this person.

38
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,940
We are not connected.

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,730
Deep posted it a really good one because if you don't want to waste your time pitching people who have

40
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,600
posted for a job opportunity in the last month, we can do the past week.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,480
We can even do the past.

42
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,480
And so I'm going to shuffle this so it's a little more streamlined.

43
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,620
So there we go.

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,750
We have people who are seeking assistance in the past week, which is great.

45
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,080
Now these two things, if you were looking to work with a specific company, you could type this in

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,350
here.

47
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,070
But chances are if you had your sights on a company actually doesn't make sense because like if you

48
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:28,380
wanted to work with Instagram, for example, they're probably not typing anything in.

49
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,760
Yeah, so they're not seeking a virtual assistant, which we could have figured.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,960
So I'm going to get rid of that and go back here.

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,280
OK.

52
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,610
So hands free setup.

53
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:48,360
So something I want to point out, by the way, is that if you find a post that you're interested in,

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,260
so you're looking at this person's profile and you're like, OK, they're looking for a part time VA.

55
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,270
Now I wish.

56
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,940
And in a perfect world, this person would have included the skills that they're looking for any potential

57
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,920
time zone, maybe even a budget.

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,960
But we don't live in a perfect world.

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,310
I know it's awful.

60
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,490
So whilst I wish that clients would get really specific on their job search, here's what you and I

61
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:14,880
can do.

62
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,010
You can simply click on their profile.

63
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,529
Take a look up there in San Francisco.

64
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,730
Fantastic.

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,390
Take a look at the things that, oh, they've got a featured section.

66
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,260
That's even better.

67
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,370
You can look at their CV, you can look at their YouTube videos.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,620
This activity is great, too.

69
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,960
You can get a better sense for the type of things that they're posting for articles that they're writing

70
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,390
for, posts that they're making for interactions that they're having on LinkedIn.

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,690
So this all activity is also a fantastic way to get a better sense for who this person is.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,900
And if they look like somebody who you are interested in working with and it's actually time to send

73
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,810
them a pitch, which is so exciting because we just started this search.

74
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,900
So let's see what this person wrote.

75
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,950
Hire someone with message you with details.

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,930
OK.

77
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,290
This, to me, means absolutely nothing.

78
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,370
What is this person supposed to do with this response?

79
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,140
Nothing.

80
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,140
There's nothing actionable.

81
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:22,090
If there's one thing you take away from this whole course as a VA, it is this when you are starting

82
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,530
to pitch clients who you're interested with, I want you to be specific.

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,680
Don't you dare ever respond with?

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm interested if you type in, I'm interested to a job opportunity.

85
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,730
I want you to throw yourself on the floor and keep yourself there as punishment for at least 20 minutes.

86
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,670
Don't do that because simply saying I'm interested leaves the client.

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,280
The potential client leaves them with doing all the legwork like they have to reach out to you.

88
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,840
Do they send you an email?

89
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,920
Do they send you a DM?

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,210
You've given them zero information about your skills or what it is you do, or how you can help them?

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,200
That stinks.

92
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,980
And let's just assume that they have 30 other Vas who are also commenting like, I'm interested, and

93
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,030
here's how you contact me.

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,390
You're all going to get lost in a sea of the I'm interested.

95
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,620
So I've got a script, several scripts, but I have a script for you in the next section that will help

96
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,890
you spell out exactly how to pitch somebody like this.

97
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,420
But essentially, what you'll want to do is say, Hi client name.

98
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,100
You know, I'm I'm doing this on the fly.

99
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,910
There is a script for you in the next section, but I want to get a point across the point that you're

100
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,830
like, I'm I'm Aaron, I want you to introduce yourself and I assist.

101
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,090
Uh, what is she a coach?

102
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:54,730
I say I assist coaches like your self with, and then you're going to list out with invoices with website

103
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,720
design, you know?

104
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,560
Again, I'm just spitballing here, you're going to list out your services boom, boom, boom.

105
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,840
And then you're going to say, I would love to connect with you.

106
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,660
I already checked out well.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,120
Your oh, my god, your profile and I love what you're doing with X.

108
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,620
So the point here is that you want to make it a little more relevant to them, like you never wanted

109
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,990
to send a carte blanche like, hey, I assist with.

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,190
Call me.

111
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,330
You want to actually get the point across that you looked at their profile.

112
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,030
You're like, Yep, I actually love neurobiology.

113
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,740
I love what you're doing in this company.

114
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm really interested to hear more about how you're doing x y z with epigenetics.

115
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I don't even know what that is.

116
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:52,960
And then I'm going to say I will send you a direct message so we can continue our conversation offline.

117
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,730
Haha.

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,570
The reason that I like to say I want to continue this offline.

119
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,150
Oh, and then you're going to post that.

120
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,840
I'm not actually going to post this because I I don't want to work with this person, but I'm going

121
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:04,900
to.

122
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,730
So post, you're done.

123
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,960
You post it once you have posted it, I want you to message this person.

124
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,050
If you remember from an earlier lecture, if this is locked, if this message was locked like this person

125
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,710
is, you're going to connect with her and LinkedIn gives you the option to send a message.

126
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,670
So when you hit Connect, you can say, Hey, I'm Aaron, I left you a comment on your job search.

127
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,640
Looking forward to speaking with you further.

128
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,679
It's as simple as that, but I want to bring your attention back here.

129
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:38,980
This right here so we can continue our conversation offline is a gold mine.

130
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:45,160
Be sure to say that because the best thing that we can do is Vas is make sure that we're giving a potential

131
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:52,480
client a timeframe that we are intending to follow up with them, that we are especially attending to

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,710
either email with them getting to their inbox, get a phone number because the more involved and active

133
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,090
you can get a potential client with you, the more likely they are to sign you.

134
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,560
Think back again.

135
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,150
I can't tell you how many people I see on job opportunities.

136
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,110
Only comment with.

137
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm interested.

138
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,060
I can do this.

139
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,050
Let's talk.

140
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,840
That is not going to get you noticed, my friends.

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,470
What's going to get you noticed is your skills.

142
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,080
You reiterating how you can help this person.

143
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,080
You're getting in touch with them and you're getting on the phone or in their inbox and emailing them.

144
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,890
So if there's one thing you take away from this course is this be specific, be precise, be active,

145
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,330
be interesting.

146
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,300
Be interested in the work that they're doing and get them on the phone or get them emailing with you.

147
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,990
That alone is an invaluable tip that I don't think enough people do when they talk about LinkedIn.

148
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,080
So, yes, LinkedIn is great for finding these people, but the real magic happens when you actually

149
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,250
start the conversation.

150
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,690
OK, well, oops.

151
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,100
Oops.

152
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,380
Oh, so that was long.

153
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
OK, so that is just one way that you can start.

154
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,300
That was just one half of this video search bar looking for seeking virtual assistant looking for a

155
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,990
virtual assistant.

156
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,230
You can try all sorts of different phrases and see what comes up in your search results.

157
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,350
The next thing we can do, however, is we can hone in on your ideal client.

158
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,160
So part two of this video is I'm going to pretend that let's say for you, for your sake, that you

159
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,920
really want to work with freelance writers.

160
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,690
Maybe that's your your thing.

161
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,760
Maybe you're really good at copy editing.

162
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,130
So what we're going to do is type in freelance writer and we're going to hit enter.

163
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:54,070
So from here, we're actually going to go back to the people and you'll see here we already have seven

164
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:01,300
hundred and twenty five thousand results, so I want to get us a little more dialed in on the kind of

165
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,030
person we want to work with so we can look for certain locations you can enter.

166
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,570
Different countries certainly doesn't need to be just the US.

167
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,450
I'm going to go ahead and toggle the US on.

168
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,390
I've already narrowed it down by half.

169
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,490
I want to work with somebody who is self-employed.

170
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,830
OK, so now we're down to three thousand people, we're getting there, and maybe even I want to do

171
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,180
first or second connections.

172
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,450
You can also keep this open if you want to cast a wider net.

173
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:42,790
If we go over to this all filters, we can even start to winnow down based on languages based on the

174
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,720
industry.

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,150
So.

176
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,720
Oh ho.

177
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:53,140
So I work in film and I am a copywriter, and I really want to work for self-employed freelance writers

178
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,820
who work in the entertainment industry.

179
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,420
And all the sudden, I'm down to one hundred and fifty eight results.

180
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,640
So the more specific you can be about your ideal client and what this person looks like, the better.

181
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,220
So from this point on, what I would do is simply look through this list of people and I might come

182
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:18,580
down and say, You know, OK, I'm interested in this person or I'm interested in this scriptwriter,

183
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,520
so I would simply click on their file, take a look at their profile.

184
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,480
This guy is not super active, but he's got a couple of links, which is great.

185
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,620
Get a better sense for what exactly this person does.

186
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,490
Particularly helpful if they have a website, but anything that you can do to glean more information

187
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,470
from those people, this person, the better.

188
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,620
And then if they end up being something that you're interested in working with, you get to know them.

189
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,370
You connect.

190
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:49,720
Wow.

191
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,810
So so you connect with them first, you introduce yourself and again in the next section, I'm going

192
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,810
to have scripts for you, but you send them a connection request.

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
You're like, Hey, I'm so-and-so, I'm a virtual assistant.

194
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,560
I work with free freelance creative writers like yourself.

195
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,650
I just wanted to see what kind of work you were up to get to know you a little better.

196
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,550
And I look forward to seeing you on LinkedIn a little more.

197
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,850
Don't usually recommend that right off the bat, you pitch somebody that you don't know.

198
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,720
Like in the first section of this video, people were seeking virtual assistants.

199
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,720
That makes sense for you to appropriately pitch them.

200
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,290
But for example, in this in this example, I've honed in on my ideal client, but Hannah Nielsen has

201
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,970
no freaking clue who I am.

202
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,140
So if I reached out out of the blue and was like, Hey, I'm a virtual assistant and I really want to

203
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,880
work with you, that doesn't make much sense because a I don't know if she's looking for an assistant

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,560
B.

205
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,040
She might just ignore us.

206
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,290
C Think about it this way.

207
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,070
Think about LinkedIn as if you were sitting next to this person.

208
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,600
Hanna at a bus stop.

209
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,940
If you guys were in real life, sitting side by side and you sat down next to Hanna and you turn to

210
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,620
her and you said, Hey, I'm a virtual assistant, I can't wait for work with you or like, Hey, maybe

211
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,550
you're going to hire me.

212
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,160
She'd be like, What?

213
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,340
She's like, Who are you?

214
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,560
So I don't want you to lose your sense of humanity and how we actually interact with people.

215
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,230
So at this point, when you meet your potentially ideal client that you're like, Hmm, I could be pretty

216
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,880
interested in working with somebody like Hanna.

217
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,450
All you're going to do is connect with this person.

218
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,140
You're going to send them a message and you're going to just say something like, Hey, I work with

219
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,060
freelance writers.

220
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,360
I was looking at your profile.

221
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,770
I see that you do x y z in the entertainment business.

222
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,510
I also used to work in film.

223
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,430
Looking forward to getting to know you better.

224
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,680
So just something that's relevant to them.

225
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:52,600
Super simple doesn't take a lot of effort on your part, but the point is LinkedIn works better.

226
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,570
When you have more connections, the more connections you have, the better.

227
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,630
The more you can be a helpful resource to the people, the better.

228
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,760
You are basically starting a relationship with these people remotely.

229
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,160
So don't go overboard.

230
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,420
Don't be too pushy.

231
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,280
If you're messaging people who you think are your ideal client?

232
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,440
Don't pitch them right away.

233
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,850
We'll get there eventually, and we'll talk about that later in the course.

234
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,490
But the point here is I want you to get started and get familiar with searching.

235
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,940
A search bar is a gold mine on LinkedIn.

236
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,800
So don't be afraid to use it.

237
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,500
Don't be afraid to use specific language.

238
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:35,500
Don't be afraid to message people to connect with people to if you see somebody that's seeking virtual

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,060
assistants and you're a perfect fit.

240
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,770
Comment on their post.

241
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,160
So, yeah, this was a very long lecture to, I guess in summation, say that the search bar is awesome.

242
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,440
I definitely want you to practice using it.

243
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:55,270
And before you go to the next lecture, I would love if you took just five minutes to to do some searching.

244
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,220
See what kind of jobs are out there?

245
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,870
What are people looking for?

246
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,600
Look for other phrases and see what other stuff comes up.

247
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,080
Yeah, those.

248
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,010
I just clicked on a searching virtual assistant in seeking the searching.

249
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,730
And there's another hiring thing a whole company is hiring a virtual assistant, so the opportunities

250
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,510
are out there.

251
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,560
Don't be afraid to get in on that search bar and get dirty.

252
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,560
All right, I'll see you in the next section.

253
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,470
In four scripts to help you pitch, and then we're going to look for other ways to search for jobs.

254
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,450
Very exciting.

255
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,420
There are endless opportunities on LinkedIn.
