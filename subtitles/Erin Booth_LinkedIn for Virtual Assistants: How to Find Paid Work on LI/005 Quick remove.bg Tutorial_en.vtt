00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.890
So I want you to go to remove Dot B G, it's basically removed up background.

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.040
All we're going to do is hit enter and then this tool is simple, simple, simple and free, free free.

3
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.040
So if you've watched the previous lecture, you know, I was trying to work with this photo and already

4
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.870
had some circles around me had some background that I probably could have removed and then use that

5
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.500
on the banner.

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.310
Well, how fast was that before I was even done talking?

7
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.470
Removed RPG removed the background for me, which is exactly what I wanted.

8
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.510
It's really quick.

9
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
Once you drop a photo in the air, I will automatically detect what's in the background and it will

10
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.610
take away if you notice that it misses the mark on a couple of items.

11
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.890
All we're going to do is hit, edit and look for a race restore.

12
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.640
Here is, if we wanted to restore, it would restore the background and we're going to undo that.

13
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.520
If we wanted to erase the background will simply hit erase.

14
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.670
This is your brush size, so I could make it as large or small as I wanted to.

15
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.380
And it definitely takes a steady hand, steadier hand than I am right now.

16
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:22.480
But it does take a bit of a steady hand and a little bit of patience to smooth out some of this extra

17
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.020
stuff.

18
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.770
OK.

19
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.880
All right.

20
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.260
So if I'm happy with this photo, all I want to do is download it.

21
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.350
This will get saved to your file and then you can then upload this face, which will be your face or

22
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.490
your logo or whatever.

23
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.590
Upload that to Canva and then edit until your heart's content.

24
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.780
Couple of other things that I want to point out that you can do, which I love, by the way, is you

25
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.830
can blur background.

26
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.220
I do think the blurred background is a pretty cool feature, because if you're trying to make an iPhone

27
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.140
or an Android photo look like a little more like a headshot, you could blur the background that definitely

28
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.750
makes it look a little more professional.

29
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.310
You can also add I've actually never use these, but you do have the option to add some backgrounds.

30
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.200
So if a color background is your jam or maybe a light gray light blue, then maybe this is something

31
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.910
that you entertain using as well.

32
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.330
And I like the light blue makes me feel like we're doing middle school yearbook photos, but it's an

33
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.750
option.

34
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.020
So play around with this tool.

35
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.250
It's fun, it's free.

36
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.570
It's super fast.

37
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.040
And it's definitely a way to make your headshot look a little more professional, especially if you

38
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.000
are using this to add a little pizzazz to your Canva background.
