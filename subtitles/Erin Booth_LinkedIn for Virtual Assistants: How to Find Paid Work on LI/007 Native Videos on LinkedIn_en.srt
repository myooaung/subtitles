1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,969
So why is video on LinkedIn so powerful?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,810
Well, by now, you've probably heard that 80 percent of all content consumed online is VIDEO.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,960
And in this video, I'm going to talk a little bit more about native video on LinkedIn and what makes

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,610
it such a powerful tool.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,310
Now, besides the fact that 80 percent of people are already interacting with VIDEO More Did you know

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,350
that 90 percent are using those videos to make purchasing decisions?

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,050
I mean, just think about that for a minute.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,000
I hope your mind was just blown over.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,960
The people who are on LinkedIn, these are CEOs, C-suite level CEOs, VIPs.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,110
These are the decision makers who are in charge of finding and hiring people like you.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,040
They are making purchasing decisions based on a video.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,120
So if you're a virtual assistant and you start setting out weekly videos that educate people about your

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,099
your skill set or educate people about something that you're a master in, like if you are masterful

14
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:12,210
at SEO or web type website design and that's your jam and you're not making videos about how good you

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,080
are or you're not making videos about tips or tools or things people should be doing for their own business

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,420
and using SEO as a major missed opportunity.

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,490
So hopefully now you're ready to upload videos on LinkedIn, and there are two ways that you can go

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,060
about doing it.

19
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,390
One.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,630
You can upload a link from YouTube.

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,820
So let's say you film a video about your niche and you upload it on YouTube, but then you take that

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,110
YouTube link and you put that on LinkedIn with a little blurb about what it is that the person is going

23
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,530
to watch.

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,910
That's good.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,340
I mean, that gets a lot of engagement, but you know what's better?

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,310
Native VIDEO And what that means is that you're uploading the same video that you put on YouTube.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,290
You just upload it as a native.

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,180
VIDEO No link.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,610
You're just uploading it straight up to LinkedIn.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,670
And the reason that works so much better is because social media platforms really like to promote their

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,470
own platform the same way that other algorithms work, like on Facebook.

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,280
Facebook doesn't like to promote links that take other people away from Facebook, so if you are constantly

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,930
linking to other websites, Facebook is not going to promote you as much.

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,570
But if you're doing live video that's native to the content if you're doing native videos that you're

35
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,690
uploading straight to Facebook.

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,340
Facebook likes that they're going to reward you by promoting you more.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,900
OK, so hopefully by now you guys are like my phone, I'm ready to film and upload it to LinkedIn.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,430
And if you are ready to do that, then my job here is done.
