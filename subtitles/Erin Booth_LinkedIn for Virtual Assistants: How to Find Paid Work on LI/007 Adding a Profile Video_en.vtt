00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.290
All right, everybody, in this lecture, we're going to take our profile photo and make it a little

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.310
more interactive.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.780
That's because as of 2022, you can now add a video to your profile so that when someone clicks on the

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.080
photo, it actually plays about a 15 second video.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.600
So unfortunately, you need to have the LinkedIn app on your phone.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.960
So if you don't already have either your Apple or Android LinkedIn downloaded on either one of those

7
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.480
do so now, please, because we're going to be working on this when you get to your profile on the phone.

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.060
You'll notice that there's a plus sign on your profile photo now.

9
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.860
You can't see that plus sign when you're on your computer using LinkedIn.

10
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.120
This is only through the phone.

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.880
And what we're going to do is click on that and an option will come up that says add profile.

12
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.320
VIDEO LinkedIn will give you a little run through about how to make a video, which is cute, so you

13
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.019
can also watch this little 15 second tutorial.

14
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.850
I'm going to zoom out of that.

15
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.810
Now here I am.

16
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.260
Oh, this is a really good angle from both angles.

17
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.490
So here I am.

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.930
You can see that my phone is going to be recording my self.

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.070
So essentially what we're going to do is just record a quick video.

20
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.080
Now my recommendation when you're recording are to do the following things.

21
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.760
One, make sure you're in a well-lit area.

22
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.470
Now, as you can see here, I've got some light boxes in my office.

23
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.070
You don't have to have a light box to film.

24
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.550
You can actually just use a really, well, sunlit window to if you've got windows on a sunny day,

25
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.000
use that natural light to your advantage if you've got bright lamps.

26
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.680
Simply move towards that light.

27
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.270
But the point is you want to have front facing light so that your face is well lit.

28
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.280
You don't want to have light behind you.

29
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.080
That will make the background brighter than your face and will have a hard time seeing you.

30
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.039
You don't have to have any fancy microphone equipment.

31
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.680
Just make sure you're holding the phone relatively close to your face and you're speaking into the camera

32
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.990
and you're enunciating well.

33
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.740
Next, I recommend that you have a 10 to 15 second introduction prepared before you start filming.

34
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.280
So if you want to save yourself a couple of minutes of cuts and awkward starts and false starts, have

35
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.240
your tagline written down have just a little bit something about you, even if you wanted to pull heavily

36
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.640
from your title on your LinkedIn.

37
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.450
So that would be.

38
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.280
I'm a virtual assistant.

39
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.030
I assist small and medium startups in California, and if you are starting your business and you want

40
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.140
to blah blah blah, the point is write that down.

41
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.040
Make sure you have a really specific, concise tagline written out before you start filming.

42
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.000
So I've got my tagline ready to go and I'm going to film for you.

43
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.470
I'm going to show you what this looks like and how to upload it to your profile.

44
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.820
So here we go.

45
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.920
Hi, I'm Erin.

46
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.780
I help virtual assistants.

47
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.540
You guys.

48
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.940
I forgot to hit the recording button.

49
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.440
Hi, I'm Erin.

50
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.520
I hope virtual assistants like you discover your niche, work with your dream clients and create a profitable

51
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.750
business from day one.

52
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.800
And I have virtual assistants like you just.

53
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.250
It's fine.

54
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.450
So there are a couple of things that we can do from here as well.

55
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.500
You'll see in the bottom there's a little circle indentation.

56
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.900
I'm going to click on that and we can add kind of little stickers and gifs.

57
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.150
It's not too dissimilar from something like Instagram is doing nowadays.

58
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.590
So we can we can add, you know, a contact me that could be a little sticker or a little contact me

59
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.040
right there.

60
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.980
We can also add our own text.

61
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.300
So if you wanted to include your email, we could just do something like, you know, I'm sorry.

62
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.770
Yes, we could do something like your email.

63
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.589
We could do your website.

64
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.890
OK?

65
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.040
So it could look simply something like your website, your email, maybe a call to action like, you

66
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.160
know, DM me or email me at.

67
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.920
So I'm making this very, very simple.

68
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.850
You can make yours as beautiful and complicated or as simple as you want.

69
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.910
I think the most important thing to remember about creating a video for your LinkedIn profile is that

70
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.260
again, it should be well lit.

71
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.940
You should be well-versed.

72
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.600
You should know exactly what it is that you want to say and not too dissimilar from your title.

73
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.430
I think it's best if you if you reiterate who you are, what you do.

74
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.320
Virtual assistant who you serve.

75
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.790
I serve my partners.

76
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.750
I serve writers.

77
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.270
I work with coaches and how you help them.

78
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.030
So just a little bit of like who I am.

79
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.890
This is how I'm going to help you.

80
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.820
This is who you are.

81
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.190
If you are this person, contact me all you're going to do when you're happy with your video.

82
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.020
Oh, I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.170
If you're not happy with your video, hit the back arrow that will erase the content and you can rerecord

84
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.650
yourself.

85
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.070
But if you are in fact happy with it, we're going to hit next.

86
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.380
This is the preview of what your face looks like in the circle.

87
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.310
We can zoom in, we can zoom out.

88
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.830
I can drag this down a little bit.

89
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.830
And then if you're happy and ready to go, shared your profile.

90
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.480
When a potential client or another virtual assistant gets to your page, they'll be able to click on

91
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.060
this photo and actually it will auto play.

92
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.300
The reason that we're not seeing this is because I am logged in as myself, but I will show you what

93
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.890
this looks like on another person.

94
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.320
Once again, you'll see the blue ring around this person's photo, and if I were to click on it, her

95
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.190
video automatically plays making a mental note myself to do exactly what tiny did and add some music.

96
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.930
I just want to wrap up that even though a video isn't mandatory by any means.

97
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.660
It is a good idea to give people an introduction to yourself, self, your services, your personality,

98
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.340
or you can even do what Tanya did and advertise some sort of a product or a website.

99
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.640
I like that she didn't even use her face.

100
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.040
And yet let me turn that off to the sound off.

101
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.200
I like that she didn't use her face, and yet we get some vital info from her.

102
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.310
We get her website where we can sign up for a free e-book.

103
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.100
We get a snapshot of what her website looks like.

104
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.410
I think it's actually a really cool and pretty effective way to use this 15 seconds as well.

105
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.420
So think through how you want to use a video for your own profile and go wild with it.

106
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.020
You certainly don't have to do what I did for Batum at the end of the day.

107
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.910
However, keep in mind that the best way to utilize any info on your LinkedIn is to reiterate who you

108
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:09.570
are, who you service, and how you are going to be the best virtual assistant for potential clients.
