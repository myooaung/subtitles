00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.340
Next, we're looking at a section called the featured section when somebody visits your LinkedIn profile.

2
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.330
I just want to point out that the analytics and resources that you and I see on our own profile cannot

3
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.010
be seen by other people.

4
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.060
So when a potential client or another virtual assistant comes to your LinkedIn page, what will happen

5
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.630
is they'll see this first section with your name, your title.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.190
And when they scroll down, they will see the featured section.

7
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.460
This is one of my absolute most favorite sections of LinkedIn, because the featured section allows

8
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.340
you to really showcase work that you're proud of, work that showcases your best skills, your talent.

9
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120
It helps people get to know you a little better, and basically, it can be a portfolio of your work.

10
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.970
If you don't already have the featured section enabled, scroll up to the top of your profile and look

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.410
for Add Profile section.

12
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.370
Under the recommended subheading, you will see ad featured.

13
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.650
It's going to click on that, and LinkedIn will automatically add a blank featured section for you.

14
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.480
You'll see here I already have a couple of links loaded on mine.

15
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.140
I'd like to recommend that you have anywhere from three to five pieces of content that you're most proud

16
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.900
of and that best showcases your work.

17
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.750
And if you are, or when you are rather ready to upload your own content, you're simply going to hit

18
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.590
this plus sign.

19
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.710
Here we can add a native post an article, we can add a link as you'll see all of minor links.

20
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.250
All that means is that this content links out to a different website.

21
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.830
These so happen to link to my YouTube.

22
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.410
You can add media like photos.

23
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.350
Let's say you are interested in graphic design, and that's where you hope to take your virtual assistant

24
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.800
business.

25
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.440
You can head to Canva and create mockups that you think showcase your best work.

26
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.440
Or if you've already done work for clients, that's related.

27
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.610
Ask them if you can upload some of the work that you've done for them onto your LinkedIn to help spread

28
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.560
the word about how amazing you are.

29
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.730
Once you have certain things uploaded and you decide, let's just say, three six months down the road

30
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.500
that some of the content you uploaded today no longer serves a purpose.

31
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.350
Maybe you changed your skills, maybe you changed your niche.

32
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.290
Maybe you've just gotten better and you want to upload better work or more recent or more relevant work.

33
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.680
We're going to click the pencil icon, and this is where we can either delete certain things that you've

34
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680
already linked to or we can edit them.

35
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.140
We can change the title, the descriptions, or if you hit this arrow right here, we can even reorder

36
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.920
the content.

37
00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.370
So for example, if I wanted people to get to my website first, I can click on these little bars on

38
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.990
the right hand side and I can simply drag that content up to the top.

39
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.960
So that means the next time somebody looks at my featured section, the website is now the first thing

40
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.160
that they're going to see.

41
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.270
So many, many different things you can do with this section.

42
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.060
I do think and your homework, should you choose to accept it before you move on to the next section,

43
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.330
which is all about your about section, that's your summary.

44
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.420
I want you to choose at least one piece of content that you can upload it to the featured section.

45
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.720
It can be something that you've pre-written in the past.

46
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.530
It can be a video that you've linked to that you've created for YouTube or, heck, even your Instagram.

47
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.030
If you are already creating content about the benefits of a virtual assistant or you've already done

48
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.160
work for other clients in the past, take ownership and pride in that work and share it.

49
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.400
Seriously, I want you to take just 15 minute tops.

50
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.810
Set yourself a timer and think through just one piece of content that you can share if you're really

51
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.180
scrambling and you don't have anything to share right now.

52
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.740
Then I want you to do this.

53
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.180
Look through your list of skills that you intend to offer.

54
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.540
Now, if you're a brand new VA and you know that you want to offer graphic design, I think I mentioned

55
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.330
this earlier in the video, but head to Canva create a free design.

56
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.920
Perhaps it's a mockup of a website.

57
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.790
Perhaps it's a mockup of what you envision for a flyer, for certain services, for your client, sky's

58
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.290
the limit because you're making this up.

59
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.740
The point is, I want you to choose something that showcases your skills, specifically the skills that

60
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.720
you are trying to sell so that when clients get to your LinkedIn page, they'll have a better sense

61
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.250
for your type of work.

62
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.150
All right, so it's homework time.

63
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.240
Remember, if you don't have a featured section, add it to the profile and hit that plus sign and get

64
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.990
to creating.

65
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.960
Once you are done creating one piece of content for this featured section, I want you to send me a

66
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.860
note on LinkedIn.

67
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.050
Show me what you're building, and I cannot wait to see the type of stuff that you guys are coming up

68
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.290
with.
