00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.070
Searching for online clients or jobs is scary enough, and the last thing you need whilst you're searching

2
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.940
for income is to be duped by a job posting that's actually a scam.

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.850
The bad news job scams are out there.

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.910
The good news with the tips that we're going to talk about in this video, you can avoid them altogether.

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.640
Number one, you never applied in the first place.

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.520
If you get a message that says something like, Want your resume and I can't wait to hire you, that's

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.150
not real.

8
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.620
It is very rare for recruiters or clients to to find you in a way that makes it sound like they have

9
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.430
your resume or they've looked at info or you've submitted info and some link.

10
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.570
That doesn't happen.

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.200
Well, it's not to say that clients won't reach out and say something more human and realistic, like,

12
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.680
Hi Erin, I'm looking for a virtual assistant and I came across your profile.

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.290
Are you open to work like that?

14
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.070
That's normal.

15
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.930
But somebody who says, I found your resume or thanks for submitting for this job when you didn't at

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.320
all.

17
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.550
This is definitely a scam.

18
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.520
Number two, the pay is way too good to be true.

19
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.200
Now sometimes you'll see a job listing that says something inane, like $100 an hour for virtual assistants.

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.590
And you might be thinking, that sounds great.

21
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.280
I would love to make one hundred dollars an hour.

22
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.210
Wouldn't we all?

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.080
But I want you to keep in mind that if it's something that's way outside of the realm of reality, like,

24
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.230
for example, most North American virtual assistants charge anywhere from 15 to 20 dollars.

25
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.840
If you're getting started, you can even charge 30 to 40 dollars if you're in a high demand, well-paying

26
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.230
niche.

27
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.700
So keep that in mind, because if you were somewhere in the 20 to 25 to 30 dollar range as an assistant

28
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.710
and then a job is offering you some stupid amount of money, it's probably not real.

29
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.660
Number three, your research isn't coming up with any results.

30
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.110
So if somebody reaches out to you claiming to be from some company and you Google their name you Google,

31
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.810
perhaps their email or you google their title or you Google the website and you're not really finding

32
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.950
a lot of results, or at least none of the websites really look that legit.

33
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.300
It's probably not.

34
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.940
Fortunately, nowadays, most companies and people have their own social media channels, their own

35
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.040
brands, their own websites.

36
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.010
So if your results aren't really coming up with anything viable, I want you to consider that a major

37
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.880
warning sign.

38
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.020
Number four, it's a very poorly written correspondence, so if you get a message from somebody and

39
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.690
it's riddled with mistakes, grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes, it's awkwardly worded or something

40
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.800
doesn't quite make sense.

41
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.140
That's a major major red flag as well.

42
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.620
That's because companies how we just went through the list and looked for job listings from companies.

43
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.520
Companies have people on their team that they pay writers H.R., people who are able to put together

44
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.530
a professional job posting.

45
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.350
And that posting is going to get run up the flagpole.

46
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.240
It's going to get approval from the bosses, from the CEO to make sure that it makes sense and that

47
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.660
they're trying to capture the right client.

48
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.200
So if you're if you're finding job posts that are not easy to understand or easy to read, or there's

49
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.030
just way too many awkward, unprofessional mistakes.

50
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.500
Major major red flag that this is not a legitimate listing.

51
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.540
Number five, super vague job description.

52
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.850
This has actually happened to me before.

53
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.020
You think you're talking to somebody real and then you ask, but they're looking for and they give you

54
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.360
a really vague job description.

55
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.110
Jobs, especially virtual assistants, should not be hard to understand.

56
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.760
A client should know what kind of work they're seeking.

57
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.060
But if you get somebody who says to you something like, Oh, well, you know, I just need you to do

58
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.980
admin work and you're like, OK, like what?

59
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.080
And they're like, you know, admin work and you're like, OK, but what specifically?

60
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.780
And they're like just the help of the CEO.

61
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.530
I know you can go in circles and circles in circles, but if they're not able to tell you specifically

62
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.830
the skills that they're looking for, the niche that they're in, the the the types of duties that they're

63
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.310
probably going to be giving to you major red flag that it's actually fake because they haven't actually

64
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.959
because they don't actually have a job to offer.

65
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.760
Number six, if a client or a recruiter from a job send you to a really weird looking website.

66
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.990
So most websites are legit.

67
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.940
You can tell that they're legit because they'll be a little luck icon in the upper hand corner that

68
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.080
already tells you that this is a secure, safe, real website.

69
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.900
If you're getting websites that are misspelled or just a little bit off, it might not be real or they

70
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.760
look kind of perfect, but they're not quite like, let's say, for example, somebody from Amazon wants

71
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.000
you to work for them as a virtual assistant, and they send you to a website that's like Amazon's assistant

72
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.660
dot com.

73
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.000
It's probably not real, or if they send you to something like Amazon a z dot com.

74
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.710
That's not Amazon's website.

75
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.090
So if it's a little bit off, if the website looks like it could be legit, but it's just a little bit

76
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.800
off, I want you to trust your gut and stay away from that particular link and job posting.

77
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.480
If number seven, this person has a generic email to, most clients will send you a message from their

78
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.260
branded email.

79
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.450
So if they have a website, if they have their own business, they're going to be sending you an email

80
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.370
that's like John at Apple.com.

81
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.280
It's rare nowadays that somebody will send you something from Gmail or Yahoo or AOL.

82
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:49.240
So if you are getting emails from potential clients or recruiters that are like one two three at yahoo.com,

83
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:56.050
probably not real major red flag particularly true if you're talking to a potential client and then

84
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.300
they're like, Hey, send me an email at Simpsons. Forever at AOL dot com.

85
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.190
No, just no.

86
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.360
Number eight, if a client asks you for an interview over a messaging service, I want you to run for

87
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.870
the hills.

88
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.820
That's so unprofessional.

89
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.920
No client in their right mind is not going to get on the phone or a video call with you.

90
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:25.840
Clients will never, almost never ask you to do an interview over WhatsApp over text messages over Gchat.

91
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.980
Can't even imagine doing an interview over text, but if somebody asks you to get on a messaging service

92
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.510
and wants to bypass some sort of chat software, this is so unprofessional.

93
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.140
No legitimate company or person is going to ask you to g chat your interview.

94
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.790
Number nine, if you send an application in or you send a pitch to a freelance client and they offer

95
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.440
you a job immediately, like there's no interview process, they just respond and they're like, Who?

96
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.070
You're hired?

97
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.290
Probably not real.

98
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.090
And that's because legitimate people and legitimate companies want to make sure that you're a good fit

99
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.810
for their company.

100
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.810
They'll want to get on the phone with you.

101
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.800
They want to discuss things like pay the job duties, your hours of operation.

102
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.170
No one, especially nowadays, is going to offer you a job sight unseen and right away.

103
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:24.400
If a potential client asks for anything like your Social Security number, your bank account details

104
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.910
any of your personal information, your address if they're asking for any of that in email or in the

105
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.690
very early stages of your interview process, that is a major, major red flag that this person is clearly

106
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.600
just fishing for your details or your bank account details.

107
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:49.090
So for example, if you meet Adam today on LinkedIn and Adam says, let's hop on a call and you do a

108
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.190
full interview with Adam and you guys decide that yes, you're a great fit and you would love to move

109
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.150
forward with one another.

110
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.350
And it is legit.

111
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:02.680
Adam, at some point will have to send you something like a W9 so that you can fill out your tax info

112
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.810
that's so that he can legally pay you.

113
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.410
I realize that what I just said is all relevant just to the United States.

114
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:16.090
But if you meet fake Adam and fake Adam gets on the phone with you, and before you even say, like,

115
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.510
Hey Adam, these are the services I offer and and this is how much I charge.

116
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.210
And he just says to you, really excited to work with you.

117
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.670
I need you to send me your bank account details so that I can.

118
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:31.750
To set up an autopay, probably not real, I need you to absolutely protect those details very closely

119
00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.929
until you are assured that this is a real job, so nobody's going to ask you for your Social Security

120
00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:38.710
number right away.

121
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.809
Nobody's going to ask you for banking details because no one needs those items whilst you're doing this

122
00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.130
initial interview part.

123
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.900
So anything more than that is absolutely a job and by scam, by the way.

124
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.840
And if anything, that somebody is asking you makes you uncomfortable.

125
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.920
Don't feel pressured to give up any details if you're unsure.

126
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.980
Last but not least, and this is a really big one, you are asked to pay for something.

127
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:13.940
If anybody asks you to pay for equipment or they ask you to like, let's say you find a job like, let's

128
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:19.820
say a client says, I really want to send you a laptop, but I'm going to need you to pay for shipping

129
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.230
so I can actually get it to you.

130
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.880
That is a simple scam that is a simple cash grab and run away scam.

131
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:33.890
No reputable company or person is going to ask you to send money to mail something in fact on that vein

132
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.250
of thought.

133
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.790
No person is going to give you a laptop like you as a virtual assistant are definitely expected to have

134
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.640
your own laptop and phone and money to pay for your bills.

135
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:50.060
These are things that you, as a business owner, bring to the client to the company.

136
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.920
So if anybody's asking you to pay for something upfront, that is not real.

137
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.910
No, sir, no man.

138
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.520
Likewise, if anybody just says to you, Hey, really want to send you a phone so we can work together?

139
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.450
Probably not real, either.

140
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.380
So the simplest way to protect yourself is just to do your research.

141
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.330
If you find a client or a client, if a client reaches out to you about a job opportunity, Google their

142
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.760
name, Google, their company, Google, everything you can possibly Google, Google, their email find

143
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.110
anything that you can find about this person to make sure that they look like a legitimate and real

144
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.470
person and then get on the phone with them again on a video chat.

145
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.350
If they're not willing to do that, it's probably a scam.

146
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.920
If you do happen to come across a scam or heaven forbid, you fall for a scam and it happens.

147
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.670
Scammers are getting pretty, pretty smart nowadays.

148
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:44.000
Don't fret, I'm actually linking in this lecture and the Resource tab to three different websites where

149
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.350
you can report job scams.

150
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.410
You can report them to the Internet Crime Center.

151
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.130
The Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission.

152
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.800
So all three of these industries will want to know what scam is going on.

153
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.390
So definitely report it, then block that person on LinkedIn.

154
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.220
Don't even give them another thought.

155
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:08.330
Fortunately, like I said before, most jobs nowadays are legit on the internet, but it helps to know

156
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.420
the red flags to look for for scams to keep your eyes open.
