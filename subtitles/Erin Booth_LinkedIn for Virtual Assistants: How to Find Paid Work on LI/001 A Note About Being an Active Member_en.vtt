00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.770
I hope you guys enjoyed the first section of the course, which was all about building your profile

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.120
up and making sure that you've got your skills and content to showcase.

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.880
It's basically setting you up for awesomeness.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.260
But the next part of this course is all about content creation, because like any social media platform,

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.580
you will get out the more effort you put in.

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.480
Meaning like any social media platform like Facebook, like Instagram, like Twitter, like Tik Tok,

7
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.050
if you are in the background, if you're not posting actively, if you aren't interacting with other

8
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.100
people, your audience is not going to grow.

9
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.000
You are not going to get any feedback.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800
People aren't going to come to your profile.

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.300
So like any of those, LinkedIn is a social media profile at its core, and so you need to treat it

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.870
like such.

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.100
So over the next few lectures, we are going to talk about liking posts, commenting on posts, writing

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.030
your own posts, sharing articles that are related to virtual assistants and why all of that matters.

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.580
But I wanted to come here face to face and drilled this into your head.

16
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
The more effort you put into this platform, the better your results will be.

17
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.100
Part of the reason why we are going through lectures about liking posts and commenting and interacting

18
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.610
with people.

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.110
Part of it is because we need the algorithm to favor you just like anything else on the internet.

20
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.170
Nowadays, it is run by an algorithm and the more active of a participant you are, the more likely

21
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.630
the algorithm is going to pay attention to you.

22
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.270
And honestly, algorithm aside, who wants to post and ghost who ever interacts with somebody who doesn't

23
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.230
interact back with you?

24
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.610
Do you have any friends that only talk about themselves?

25
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.220
If so, how does that make you feel?

26
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.270
Do you hate it?

27
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.300
Nobody and I would really argue this.

28
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.490
Nobody actually likes a person that only talks about themselves.

29
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.440
Me, me, me, me, me.

30
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.250
And asks no questions and has zero interest in you.

31
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.900
That sucks.

32
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.110
Social media is the exact same way.

33
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.450
If you get onto this platform and you're constantly talking about me, me, me, me, me, I'm doing

34
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.450
this and I'm doing that and I'm going to help you do this.

35
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.240
That's OK.

36
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.170
But it's like, you're that friend that's only talking about yourself.

37
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.860
What's better is sure for you to get on LinkedIn and share interesting articles that are related to

38
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.080
your skills, your niche virtual assistants.

39
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.840
What is helpful, though, is for you to be a friend, be a human being.

40
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.960
Be an actual friend.

41
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.610
Meet other virtual assistants and like their posts, comment on them.

42
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.070
Meet them virtually.

43
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.510
Get to know what kind of skills they offer.

44
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.720
Tell them about your skills or your ideal clients.

45
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.840
Become a known and helpful resource.

46
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.010
If you see people asking questions on LinkedIn that you can answer, answer them because the more you

47
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.370
can be a helpful resource, the more likely you are to stick out in somebody's mind.

48
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.890
And the next time somebody needs a client, they'll be like, How do I know anyone who can help me with

49
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.610
X y z?

50
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.640
And if you've been that interactive, helpful resource on LinkedIn, you will come to mind first.

51
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.150
So being an active participant is really twofold.

52
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.070
It's to help the algorithm pick you up.

53
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.390
It's to help disseminate your profile more often, but it's also to help you become a more expert,

54
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.470
experienced, helpful know and resource.

55
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.410
All those things are going to help you attract people to your profile, and that is exactly what we

56
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.740
want.

57
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.210
So if you are thinking in this course that you're simply going to set up your profile and then forget

58
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.570
about it forever, sorry, I have awful news for you.

59
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.400
That is not how this profile works.

60
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.280
The good news is we are going to break down over the next few sections how you can become interactive

61
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.200
in just minutes a day.

62
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.930
Because I do think the benefit of LinkedIn is that you can get up over the morning with a cup of coffee,

63
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.600
wake up and in 10 minutes, scroll through your feed, either through through the phone or on your computer.

64
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.680
And like a couple of posts, answer a couple of people.

65
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.270
Introduce yourself to somebody.

66
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.900
It really is that simple, and it can be done in just minutes per day.

67
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.550
Hopefully, you're excited.

68
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.650
Hopefully, you're excited.

69
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.870
Just give me the benefit of the doubt and for the next few months, post every day and see what happens.

70
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.510
I think you will be delighted by the results.

71
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.690
So, OK, that was enough of my talking head.

72
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.050
Now let's get into the section and then after this next content section, by the way, we are talking

73
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.780
about connections and job opportunities.

74
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.910
And this lecture definitely plays into the next one as well.

75
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.110
So remember this one?

76
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.880
We're also talking about making connections.

77
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.350
With other voices or pitching for jobs, you need to make sure that you have a profile that's active.

78
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.070
That's helpful.

79
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.520
Your you're an active member or an engaged member because all that's going to affect your connections

80
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.940
as well.

81
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.800
So I am pumped.

82
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.300
Let's go on to the next section where we're going to start liking posts.
