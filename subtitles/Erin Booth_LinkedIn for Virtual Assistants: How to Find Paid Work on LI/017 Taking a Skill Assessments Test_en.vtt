00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.690
Adding skills on LinkedIn is another great way to help showcase the work that you do and the work that

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.580
you think will serve your clients best.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.160
The nice thing about the skills section is that under the plus sign, you can add as many skills as

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.290
you want to, which I love.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.710
They will suggest, or LinkedIn will pull some of the verbiage that you've written on your profile,

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.740
and they'll suggest some of these things.

7
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.590
So yes, if you see skills that they're listing, like, yeah, you're like, I do social media management,

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.860
I do content strategy, I do LinkedIn advertising, whatever.

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.920
If you don't see something, add it here.

10
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.570
Once you start typing in a field, it will auto populate with some of the more common skills.

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.880
And once you're done, simply hit save, and you might notice some numbers next to skills like research.

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.570
This just simply means that thirty nine other people that I've interacted with on LinkedIn have endorsed

13
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.709
me for this skill.

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.310
That means they've come to my profile.

15
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.390
They've looked at my skills and they've given me a little like plus one next to certain skills that

16
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.570
I've either worked with them on or that they know I can do well.

17
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.240
So endorsing skills is just another way for people to come see your profile.

18
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.220
And you know, if a client were looking at my profile, as is now, they'll get a really good sense

19
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.880
that I do a lot of social media, management, marketing, event planning, and then I have some experience

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.530
in the entertainment industry.

21
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.680
So Skillz is a pretty good one.

22
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.070
Again, it's just another way for you to be able to communicate to potential clients your skills and

23
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.890
what you can do without actually telling them.

24
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.600
So I like the skill section a lot too, but the real benefit I think of having a skill section is the

25
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.280
skills assessment quiz.

26
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.110
So the skills quiz used to be called assessment testing on LinkedIn, and we are going to take one together.

27
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.759
Now I will tell you that the skills quizzes are pretty limited.

28
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.860
In fact, there's not a ton of overlap for virtual assistants.

29
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.180
A lot of it tends to be pretty specific, like you'll see here HTML the fundamentals all about coding

30
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.470
programming languages.

31
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.440
But there are certainly a few that I think we could take as virtual assistants.

32
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.970
So if you are familiar with working with PowerPoint Excel Outlook, then these might be skill quizzes

33
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.230
that you would like to test.

34
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.500
Same here.

35
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.210
If you're really handy at design, if you are a graphics virtual assistant, then Illustrator and Photoshop

36
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.010
might be the thing that you want to look at.

37
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.380
You can also search for your own quizzes, but again, the things that we do as virtual assistants don't

38
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.850
come up that often.

39
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.490
So I'm just thinking off the top of my head.

40
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.430
There's no research.

41
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.590
There's definitely no email management.

42
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.950
There's probably no calendar.

43
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.060
Nope, no travel.

44
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.480
No.

45
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.970
So the skills assessment, I think it's good if you want to take one of these because at least you can

46
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.250
showcase that you've got the basics down like at a fundamental level.

47
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.370
Clients want to know that you know how to use Word, Excel, Microsoft, PowerPoint, and so you might

48
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.870
want to take one of these when you find a subject that you want to take and you click on it, you'll

49
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.560
see that you have 15 questions, so they're pretty short.

50
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190
It actually should take you if you take the full one and a half minutes per question will take you about

51
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.390
15 minutes.

52
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.670
That's nuts, not method.

53
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.230
All math is not my strong suit.

54
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.740
But anyway, it'll take you just a few moments.

55
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.590
And obviously, if you know the answer, it'll take you even faster.

56
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.340
You can look at a question for seconds and answer it and then hear.

57
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.000
It clearly indicates that the top 30 percent so you basically need a passing grade in order for the

58
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.920
skills assessment to show up on your profile.

59
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.170
What I would like you to do right now is take a skills assessment test.

60
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.840
In fact, the next part of this course is an assignment, and it is to pick and take a skills assessment

61
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.080
test.

62
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.810
It doesn't even matter if you don't pass it.

63
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.090
I just want you to get used to this thing.

64
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.670
And if, for example, you take these skills assessment test for word and you're thinking to yourself,

65
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.800
I use word documents all the time.

66
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.510
You take the quiz and then you fail.

67
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.010
It's actually a good indication that you might want to brush up on some of the features that they're

68
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.910
asking you about.

69
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.620
So I'm going to take a quiz real quick, and when I'm done, I'm going to show you what it looks like

70
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.370
on your profile.

71
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.150
Here we go.

72
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.610
You can hold them.

73
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.190
So I'm in the top five percent, which basically means I passed, and if I wanted to, I could show

74
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.910
the badge.

75
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.010
Oops.

76
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.010
Well, actually.

77
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.680
OK.

78
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.970
Yes, I do want to show the badge.

79
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.020
Great.

80
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.820
And then I'm going to scroll down and hit them.

81
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.290
So now that I've taken the quiz and I've passed them back on my profile and I want to see this bad boy.

82
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.880
Something I should have noted earlier is that if you take a quiz, it has to be related to a skill that's

83
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.080
already on your profile.

84
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:27.300
So when I scroll down, Ellington automatically adds the past the skill assessment underneath a skill

85
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.740
point Microsoft PowerPoint.

86
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:36.390
So if you've taken a quiz from Microsoft Word or Excel, you will want to come up here and add Excel.

87
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.370
If I could spell that.

88
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.730
Boom.

89
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.870
And then once that is added to your profile, you take the assessment quiz.

90
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.950
If you've passed, then if you've passed, then LinkedIn will automatically give you a badge next to

91
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.360
your name.

92
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.240
And again, this just adds something else I've mentioned again and again.

93
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:04.280
It adds trust and transparency because again, you could tell your client that you are an absolute pro

94
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.180
at PowerPoint.

95
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.200
You could be lying.

96
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.120
You could have never touched PowerPoint in your life.

97
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.080
So your client doesn't know whether to trust you or not.

98
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.870
So if you say it back, your words up with a little bit extra in the skills assessment test is a great

99
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.890
place to start.

100
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.150
So your homework and the next section is to choose a skills assessment test and remember if you want

101
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.590
or if you don't already have the section, you're going to have to add a skills section.

102
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:38.210
Initially, you're going to add skills that you want to showcase, and then you're going to take a script

103
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.820
squeals quiz skills quiz.

104
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.170
I wish you luck.

105
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.500
I think your quiz will take you about 10 to 15 minutes.

106
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.410
Make sure if you don't pass it the first time, don't fret it's no big deal.

107
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.210
You can actually retake it again.

108
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.680
You get two chances to try a skills quiz per topic.

109
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.800
So if you take two Excel quizzes and you fail, don't worry it won't show up on your profile.

110
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.500
Like, Oh, this person failed and they don't know what you're talking about.

111
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.180
I just won't show up at all.

112
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.240
And it's another indicator that maybe you should brush up on your Excel, Quit, Excel skills.

113
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.340
Oh my god, so many letters on say, Good luck you got this.

114
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.800
I'm very excited to see what quizzes you take.
