00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,670
I want to thank you guys for spending your invaluable time with me, and I know there was a lot of reading

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,280
on this course, it's very content heavy and I hope you found a lot of value from it.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,920
You have this course in perpetuity.

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,410
So feel free to come back and access this course at any time or if there's a section that you want to

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,910
brush up upon at a later point.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,420
Come back to it.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,220
I will be sure to update this section this course accordingly.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Thank you again.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,820
I'm seriously so proud for the work that you guys have put into your profile, and I hope that by the

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,730
end of this course, you have a really sharp profile that you feel proud about, that showcases your

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,330
skills, your expertise that gets you involved on the platform.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,870
The more involved you are, the more of an investment you make into this platform, the better it will

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,430
do for you in the long run.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,380
So be consistent.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,590
Definitely don't come away from this course thinking that if you just spruce up your profile a little

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,240
bit, but don't add more people.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,410
Like if you're like, Well, I have 20 connections and then you never post anything ever again, it's

18
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,430
not going to do much for you.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,520
Being an active participant, being a known resource, being a helpful advocate, being somebody who's

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,670
involved in the platform who posts often is definitely going to help your chances of success increase

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,450
greatly.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,530
Because the more involved you are, the more the algorithm is going to pick you up, the more likely

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,490
clients potential clients will see your profile click on your profile.

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,080
It's exactly what we want.

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,720
So thank you again.

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,470

27
