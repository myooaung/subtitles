1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,860
Let's talk about certifications and skills.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,880
In fact, over the next few lectures, we're going to talk about each of those things individually.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,210
Once again, if you don't have a section that's for certificates or skills, I want you to scroll to

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,140
the top of your page.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,010
We're going to add that profile section.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,790
Skills are under your core section.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,700
This means LinkedIn thinks that you should be absolutely no questions asked, including your skills.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,689
In fact, they even say that filling this out will help you get discovered.

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,220
So skills is a definite.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,410
And then other the recommended you can do things like add courses.

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,280
Perhaps this one, you can add licenses and certifications.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,450
Certificates like this are also given out at the end of this course, of which you can certainly add

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,320
to your LinkedIn.

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,200
In fact, if you've noticed right off the bat, I have a couple of licenses too that I did years and

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,330
years ago under project management.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,610
And if I had additional certifications, then I would also add them here.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,650
I do want to note, by the way, that some of these fields will be irrelevant to you and I as Vas.

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,700
That's because certain fields like Credential ID credential, you are ill.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:25,970
This is from a credentialed school, for example, is different than something like Udemy, like Skillshare.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,060
In fact, all you need is a name of the course or certificate that you've taken, as well as the issuing

21
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,810
organization.

22
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,970
So if you were watching this on Udemy, you could enter the name of this LinkedIn skills.

23
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,830
Twenty two and then you could do Udemy as the issuing organization.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,310
The reason that I think adding certificates like this is so helpful is because it helps give potential

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,040
clients a better idea for what kind of work you've done.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,390
This is especially helpful if you're a new VA and you don't yet have any testimonials or a lot of work

27
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,930
to share with them.

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,470
They can actually come down to the section where you can direct them to this section and let them know

29
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:13,370
that you've worked on certain skills, that you've taken online courses for certain niches that basically

30
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,640
that you working on your own and proactively to make sure that you can provide the best services possible

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,370
in the next section, we're going to talk about skills, why they matter and even a skills assessment

32
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:25,730
test.
