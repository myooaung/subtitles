00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.270
If you don't already have an account, it's simple to sign up.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.530
You only need to enter your email and you can continue this for free.

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.490
Once you're logged into your account, you can type LinkedIn into the search bar here and scroll down

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.540
to LinkedIn banner.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.970
Take a look at some of their pre created templates.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.300
Anything you see with the Crown is pro.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.610
This means that you have to upgrade from a free account to the paid account, which is now at the time

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.800
of this filming about 30 dollars per month.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.590
One of my favorite things about Canva is that they do give you so many options that are free.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
So before you dive in and buy Canva, give it some time.

11
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.590
Make sure it's actually a tool that you're using regularly before you pay for it.

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.240
Once you find a template that you like and you're ready to make it a little more tailored to yourself.

13
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.370
Just click on the photo and the pre-loaded graphics will load here.

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.100
Quick note If you select a template that you end up hating, you can also just scroll down the side

15
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.290
here and choose a new one.

16
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:10.110
I will show you very briefly how you'll start making this a little more accustomed to yourself.

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.430
Anything on their template can be edited in terms of text, you can choose an entirely new font.

18
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460
You can change the size.

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.060
You can change the color.

20
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.370
You can even add effects.

21
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.790
You can do things like add a bit of a shadow, add a lift.

22
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.880
These are just a couple of things that you might want to consider to make your content stand out a little

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.240
more.

24
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.450
Now, if you do want to actually edit the text, all you're going to do is double click and then you're

25
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.440
going to type in your name.

26
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.420
Everything that you're clicking on is highlighted by a blue bar, and you'll notice that when I move,

27
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.100
some of the text around it automatically shows me what this text is in alignment with.

28
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.910
So right now, the text that I have highlighted is in alignment with the.

29
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.140
Here we go with the one two three anywhere street.

30
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.790
So consider this your easy way to design and make sure that everything is aligned with one another.

31
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.740
All right.

32
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.180
So for the sake of this video, I'm going to make it short and sweet.

33
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.550
Because in previous lessons, we've talked about the importance of having some kind of calling card

34
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.240
as a banner.

35
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.520
So I'm going to just show you how you can make a banner that's effective in just minutes.

36
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.400
So I've already selected my template, I've written my name and I'm going to put Virtue, my title virtual

37
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.910
assistant.

38
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.680
Maybe we even want to go a little further assisting with who?

39
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.030
Small to medium.

40
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.340
Start ups, OK?

41
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.680
I'm just totally making this up.

42
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.620
You could theoretically add exactly what it is that you do, who you service, your skills.

43
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.710
Really, sky's the limit when it comes to what you want to add up here.

44
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.390
Kind of like that.

45
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.320
They love this contact.

46
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.890
You could definitely leave your phone number, your email.

47
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.630
Probably not going to give your address if your remote, somebody's going to remove that so we can see

48
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.290
what that looks like.

49
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.090
OK.

50
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.330
And here too, if you want to change the picture or even add a photo of yourself, it's pretty simple

51
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.270
to simply upload a photo of yourself.

52
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.420
What you can even do is if you already have a picture of yourself that you want to use or a logo for

53
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.050
your business.

54
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.250
Whatever it is, you can actually drag from your desktop.

55
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.580
Just drag your content into this bar over here on the on the left hand side.

56
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.940
Once you drop it in your photo, upload automatically and then we've got a couple more options.

57
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.760
I can drag this over here, so you'll see it kind of snaps into one of these like egg things over the

58
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.340
guy, or I can actually delete this guy.

59
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.200
And it's not what I want to do if I click instead of drag, the photo will appear exactly where I want

60
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.570
it to appear from here.

61
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.940
If you're wondering what we can do, then we have a couple more options with this image.

62
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.530
So let's go up to edit image.

63
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.620
This is where you can adjust to kind of some simple, simple things like a brightness contrast that

64
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.910
color, the saturation.

65
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.730
There are a couple more things that Canva does for free that I think is really cool.

66
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.600
You can do a face retouch.

67
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.089
This kind of smooths out your skin to ever go smooth skin.

68
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.290
We're all living in the era of Snapchat, and we're also used to smooth skin.

69
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.630
I know it's crazy you.

70
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.040
I don't recommend doing any of these other kind of funky filters because none of these are professional,

71
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.670
but you could definitely do some, some light editing.

72
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.000
OK, so see up here they do have an option for a background remover.

73
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.630
This would remove the black and everything behind my head right here.

74
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.810
This is only available for a pro account.

75
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.560
That's a paid account.

76
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.940
But in the next lecture, I'm actually going to show you how to remove backgrounds for free, so hang

77
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.240
tight.

78
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.040
Other things that you can do with this image, you can crop it.

79
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.680
So if you simply move these squares, it's kind of an interesting way for you to crop.

80
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.740
You can resize things by clicking on position.

81
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.510
You can actually send the photo backwards behind these other elements.

82
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.700
These design elements we're going to pretend like this is wonderful and excellent, and we love it.

83
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.760
So here is what we can do next.

84
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.370
You'll notice this published on LinkedIn.

85
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.820
You couldn't do that, but that's more like it'll publish it to your feed.

86
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.350
What you'll want to do is look for this down arrow and hit download page is usually the best option

87
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.060
because it's going to be your highest quality.

88
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.940
Once that image is downloaded, I want you to go on to your LinkedIn and look for this pencil icon in

89
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.020
the upper right hand corner.

90
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.670
From here, we can go to change photo and we're going to upload a photo.

91
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.570
Here's the one that I've just created, and we're simply going to click Upload.

92
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.650
Now we can drag to reposition.

93
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.520
We can even zoom in if we wanted to.

94
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.660
Not a lot of leeway here, but definitely a couple of things to fuss around with if you wanted to.

95
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.720
And then you want to do hit apply.

96
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.150
And there's the new background right behind your photo.

97
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.750
I do recommend that you play around a little bit with positioning.

98
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.680
As you can see here, the contact info that I put right over my head is cut off.

99
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.180
I would likely move all of this info over here.

100
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.210
Maybe move the full you know you, you do you.

101
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.000
This is your creative endeavor, but just wanted to show you how you could theoretically take something

102
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.470
very, very simple and tweak it so that it's a little more your own.

103
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.910
Like I said, any of these things are editable.

104
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.510
You can add photos.

105
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.140
You can even keep a template if you like this background pencil with a cup of coffee, you could seriously

106
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.950
keep your template.

107
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.160
As simple as this one was just your name, your title and your email.

108
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.740
I think that's an awesome, awesome option because it tells people right when they go to your LinkedIn,

109
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.280
who you are, what your title is and how they can contact you.

110
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.000
So in under five to 10 minutes tops, I think you two could create a really snazzy background using

111
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.140
something like Canva.
