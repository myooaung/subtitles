00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,300
Now that we have our video profile uploaded, there are a couple other interesting things that you might

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,290
want to consider doing.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,000
We're going to click on this pencil icon to the right of your name.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,450
Here's where we can fill out first name, last name.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,510
But there are two things that I want to bring your attention to.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,250
The first is pronouns.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,360
You can now add your gender pronouns to LinkedIn.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
Personally, I like doing this because you're simply informing people how they can refer to you.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,960
And by doing this, it also allows others not to make assumptions about one's gender.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,750
I think it's a really nice thing to do nowadays, but again, this is completely optional to you.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,310
The second thing you might want to do is add a name pronunciation.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,070
If you have a name that perhaps has unique spelling or it's pronounced or it's pronounced in a way that

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,690
people typically get wrong.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,280
You can add your pronunciation simply by clicking on that blue option.

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,880
All we'll do now is click and hold on this blue button and you'll say your name.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,570
Slowly, and perhaps several times, so I'll go first.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,730
Aaron Booth.

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,050
Hi, my name is Aaron.

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,750
Let's stop playing and make sure we like it.

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,980
Hit apply and then you'll see that you have an audio recording active hitting the pencil icon allows

21
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,190
you to either delete or record an entirely new one.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,470
I'm going to go back to my profile, oops.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,520
Oh, and of course, hit save now that I'm back on my profile.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,340
You can see next to my name a new microphone icon or a megaphone.

25
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,540
I guess whatever that is, you can see a sound icon.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,570
It's a good indication that you and or somebody else on LinkedIn has added a pronunciation.

27
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,960
And when you want to hear yours, you simply tap on that button and it will play your name.
