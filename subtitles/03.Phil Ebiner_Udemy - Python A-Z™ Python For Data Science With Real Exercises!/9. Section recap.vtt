00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:08.570
Hello and welcome back to the course on Python programming.

2

00:00:08.670  -->  00:00:12.260
In today's tutorial we're going to quickly recap on what we learned in the section.

3

00:00:12.270  -->  00:00:18.570
So in this section we learned number one types of variables so we talked about the four main types I

4

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:20.670
would be working with in Python.

5

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:26.130
And those were the integer the float the boolean and the string.

6

00:00:26.130  -->  00:00:31.530
Now the integer float are important because they allow us to conduct mathematic operations and do numeration

7

00:00:31.890  -->  00:00:38.970
and the string variable is also an important tie because it allows us to store textual data and any

8

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:42.010
kind of information in the form of text.

9

00:00:42.060  -->  00:00:48.930
And of course the boolean variables are also very important because they allow us to work with things

10

00:00:48.930  -->  00:00:55.140
like loops and conditional statements and basically evaluate logical expressions.

11

00:00:55.140  -->  00:00:55.530
All right.

12

00:00:55.560  -->  00:01:00.650
Then we talked about using variables we had a look at a few examples how we can perform some of the

13

00:01:00.660  -->  00:01:08.220
mathematic operations how we can concatenate strings and do some basic operations where boolean or logical

14

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:09.050
variables.

15

00:01:09.120  -->  00:01:12.850
Then we talked about the logical variables and operators in a bit more depth.

16

00:01:12.870  -->  00:01:17.640
We looked at the different types of operators that exist in Python and how they're different to other

17

00:01:17.640  -->  00:01:18.690
programming languages.

18

00:01:18.690  -->  00:01:27.480
So remember their THAT AND OR and NOT are actually spelt out as words and rather than as the ampersands

19

00:01:27.480  -->  00:01:30.190
or the vertical pipe symbols.

20

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:36.510
And also we had some EQ we perform some experiments with the logical variables and so how they work

21

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:38.420
how they are applied in practice.

22

00:01:38.520  -->  00:01:42.320
Then we talked about the while loop that which was our first introduction to loops.

23

00:01:42.450  -->  00:01:47.750
Also in this tutorial we compared how the while loop looks in Python in other programming languages

24

00:01:47.910  -->  00:01:54.180
and we discussed the differences between Python and are that Python is not a vectorize programming language

25

00:01:54.180  -->  00:02:00.150
and therefore there will be quite a heavy load on loops and you might find yourself working with them

26

00:02:00.150  -->  00:02:00.870
quite a lot.

27

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:03.750
So it's important to know how they are structured.

28

00:02:04.020  -->  00:02:11.060
They talked about the for loop and we saw how we can use the range function to create ranges for us

29

00:02:11.050  -->  00:02:16.680
for loops and also in both these tutorials we notice that the syntax in Python is different to other

30

00:02:16.980  -->  00:02:20.940
languages in the sense that indentation is important.

31

00:02:20.940  -->  00:02:26.400
We talked about the if elif and else statements we looked at how to nest them how to chain them.

32

00:02:26.460  -->  00:02:29.150
So it was quite involved and we learned quite a bit.

33

00:02:29.370  -->  00:02:35.640
And finally we learned how to generate random variables using the rand function from the number pi package

34

00:02:35.650  -->  00:02:35.840
.

35

00:02:36.030  -->  00:02:40.940
So there was quite a large section and those were the basics of programming.

36

00:02:41.070  -->  00:02:47.010
And wherever you go from here even if you decide to move to a different approach or expand your expertise

37

00:02:47.010  -->  00:02:50.950
by learning another programming language a lot of these things are going to be very very similar.

38

00:02:51.060  -->  00:02:55.610
So it is very useful that we have covered them off and don't forget to do the quiz.

39

00:02:55.620  -->  00:03:00.340
It will help you solidify the knowledge that you gained in the section of course.

40

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:01.370
Elop next.

41

00:03:01.530  -->  00:03:02.970
Until then I'd be coding
