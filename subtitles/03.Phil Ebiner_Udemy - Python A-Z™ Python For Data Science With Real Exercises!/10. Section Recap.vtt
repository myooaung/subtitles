00:00:05.560  -->  00:00:08.700
Hello and welcome back to the Python programming course.

2

00:00:08.700  -->  00:00:09.190
All right.

3

00:00:09.210  -->  00:00:10.320
Section recap.

4

00:00:10.320  -->  00:00:13.050
So what did we learn in this section in this section.

5

00:00:13.050  -->  00:00:15.750
We learned first of all what is IList.

6

00:00:15.780  -->  00:00:19.620
We talked about lists and we also compared them to vectors in our.

7

00:00:19.620  -->  00:00:26.520
If you've learned our programming before and we kind of got comfortable with that whole concept in general

8

00:00:27.030  -->  00:00:33.450
then we created some lists we use two methods we used square brackets just to specify each individual

9

00:00:33.450  -->  00:00:38.550
element of a list and we use the range function we talked about how the range function is different

10

00:00:38.560  -->  00:00:40.920
Python 3 versus Python 2.

11

00:00:40.920  -->  00:00:44.910
Then we use the square brackets to actually access our lists.

12

00:00:44.910  -->  00:00:50.610
We also learned about slicing lists and we learn how to use the colon operator to slice lists.

13

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:56.670
We had some very interesting tutorials on that topic that we're talking about tuples a bit because tuples

14

00:00:56.670  -->  00:01:02.100
are like lists they're just immutable you can't really change the values of tuples can change at all

15

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:06.320
and they're just use for other purposes in Python.

16

00:01:06.390  -->  00:01:12.260
And we will be coming across them as we program in Python throughout the score so it was a good idea

17

00:01:12.270  -->  00:01:14.660
just to quickly get introduced to tuples.

18

00:01:14.730  -->  00:01:21.030
Then we spoke about functions and our and we had that interesting analogy of a function being a blender

19

00:01:21.040  -->  00:01:27.470
or somehow you just as you put delicious fruits and berries into a blender yet a smoothie on the output

20

00:01:27.480  -->  00:01:27.520
.

21

00:01:27.540  -->  00:01:29.290
Same thing of functions.

22

00:01:29.520  -->  00:01:35.880
You give it some inputs and then you get some outputs and also package's we talked our packages and

23

00:01:35.880  -->  00:01:44.700
our and how they are just sets of functions to increase the capabilities of ply them depending on what

24

00:01:44.700  -->  00:01:49.130
you need in your specific project and your specific circumstances.

25

00:01:49.350  -->  00:01:52.620
And then we also talked about Nam pie and arrays.

26

00:01:52.710  -->  00:01:58.860
So non-payers is a package that you'll probably be using quite a lot if not all the time being a data

27

00:01:58.860  -->  00:02:02.160
scientist using Python and arrays is.

28

00:02:02.250  -->  00:02:07.500
So we talked about different types of arrays that you can have one dimensional and two dimensional arrays

29

00:02:07.500  -->  00:02:07.680
.

30

00:02:07.830  -->  00:02:14.160
And we'll be talking more about those when we're moving onto matrices for the down of course.

31

00:02:14.250  -->  00:02:20.190
And finally we talked about slicing arrays that you can slice them in a very small matter as you can

32

00:02:20.280  -->  00:02:21.930
with lists.

33

00:02:21.930  -->  00:02:28.140
All right so hopefully enjoyed this section of the course and you got a lot of value out of these tutorials

34

00:02:28.140  -->  00:02:28.300
.

35

00:02:28.350  -->  00:02:33.570
And definitely if there's something that's unclear then it's a very good idea to go back and revise

36

00:02:33.570  -->  00:02:38.460
that specific tutorial before proceeding to the next section because this course of action a way that

37

00:02:38.520  -->  00:02:44.940
it builds on previous knowledge and we're going to be revising this also even if some things are clear

38

00:02:44.940  -->  00:02:48.900
and you understand them but at the same time you feel that you don't have enough practice at this stage

39

00:02:48.900  -->  00:02:49.150
.

40

00:02:49.290  -->  00:02:54.090
Don't worry about it too much because further down in the next section of the course we'll be practicing

41

00:02:54.110  -->  00:02:54.140
.

42

00:02:54.150  -->  00:02:56.140
Most of these topics anyway.

43

00:02:56.400  -->  00:02:59.130
And I look forward to seeing you throughout the course.

44

00:02:59.130  -->  00:03:00.750
Until next time happy coding

45

00:03:03.060  -->  00:03:06.230
.
