00:00:05,190  -->  00:00:09,930
Hello and welcome back to the course of the python program and I hope you're enjoying creating this

2

00:00:09,930  -->  00:00:11,070
first function.

3

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:12,780
I know it's quite tedious.

4

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:18,550
I know it's been quite a while that we've been working with this code to finally move from just create

5

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:23,850
a plot to create different players on that plot and then started to create a function.

6

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:30,600
It has been a lengthy process but in the end it's definitely worthwhile and we'll see that we'll witness

7

00:00:30,600  -->  00:00:34,920
that in the final tutorial for the section with where we are deriving the insights.

8

00:00:34,920  -->  00:00:39,640
It'll be obvious how easy it is to derive insights once everything is prepared.

9

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:44,880
But for now we still need to finalize our function and that's why this tutorial is called advanced function

10

00:00:44,880  -->  00:00:48,650
design because we need to take our function to the next level.

11

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:53,920
And it has to be able to assign different colors and markers to different players.

12

00:00:54,150  -->  00:00:56,010
So let's go ahead and get started on that.

13

00:00:56,220  -->  00:01:01,050
There's our code which is going to create a new line here a new cell.

14

00:01:01,050  -->  00:01:02,430
So basically what do we after.

15

00:01:02,430  -->  00:01:09,930
Well we can see that the data the information changes so if every iteration as we pass this player list

16

00:01:09,960  -->  00:01:16,860
maybe let's copy that as well as a process player list the data changes it just takes the name of the

17

00:01:16,860  -->  00:01:22,140
player into account and picks the right data right and then the label also changes what doesn't change

18

00:01:22,140  -->  00:01:25,500
is the marker and the color we want them to change.

19

00:01:25,770  -->  00:01:28,410
But at the same time we don't have somewhere to look them up.

20

00:01:28,410  -->  00:01:32,990
We don't have a place where we could look up the colors that correspond to different players.

21

00:01:33,180  -->  00:01:34,570
So how about we create that.

22

00:01:34,740  -->  00:01:35,860
And what would we create.

23

00:01:35,910  -->  00:01:39,540
Well you'd create a dictionary would say color equals.

24

00:01:39,660  -->  00:01:46,170
And then here as we learn about dictionaries in these rackets we need to specify combinations so pairs

25

00:01:46,170  -->  00:01:50,160
we need to specify key one and value one.

26

00:01:50,160  -->  00:01:54,970
Remember that and then key to value 2 and so on.

27

00:01:54,990  -->  00:01:57,340
So here it's actually key and so on.

28

00:01:57,450  -->  00:01:59,530
So where do we get these keys and mallees.

29

00:01:59,580  -->  00:02:05,550
Well we can get them from the code that we already have here so they just copy that temporarily we'll

30

00:02:05,550  -->  00:02:11,150
place it here and you can kind of see what I mean when I said that we have quite a lot of code for this

31

00:02:11,150  -->  00:02:11,900
section.

32

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:15,240
So let's actually try to zoom in maybe or work.

33

00:02:15,240  -->  00:02:18,890
All right so what we want is we want the players here right.

34

00:02:18,900  -->  00:02:24,850
So we a list of players let's go ahead and get one from the very top all our code is on the way here

35

00:02:24,860  -->  00:02:25,040
.

36

00:02:25,200  -->  00:02:28,440
Oh in fact we can actually just copy this save some time.

37

00:02:28,440  -->  00:02:32,090
Already has the list of players so let's go ahead and copy that.

38

00:02:32,140  -->  00:02:35,270
Put it in here instead of the numbers.

39

00:02:35,280  -->  00:02:40,040
We're just going to specify the colors black goes here red.

40

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:45,330
So I'll just cut the video up to where I've done it and you can just follow along and then we'll have

41

00:02:45,330  -->  00:02:47,750
the final result and we can compare that.

42

00:02:47,790  -->  00:02:48,090
All right.

43

00:02:48,090  -->  00:02:54,180
So there it's done so you can see Kobe Bryant Black Joe Johnson red LeBron James Green.

44

00:02:54,250  -->  00:02:56,010
Just make sure that they're the same.

45

00:02:56,010  -->  00:03:01,800
So that we get the same results then Carmelo Anthony blude Dwight Howard Mike Jantar Chris Bosh black

46

00:03:01,800  -->  00:03:02,710
Chris Paul red.

47

00:03:02,720  -->  00:03:06,970
Kevin Durant green Derrick Rose blude Dwayne Wade magenta.

48

00:03:07,050  -->  00:03:09,550
All right so there we go that's the result.

49

00:03:09,870  -->  00:03:14,240
Let's get rid of this of this information or here.

50

00:03:14,440  -->  00:03:15,740
Yeah let's get rid of it.

51

00:03:15,740  -->  00:03:17,820
For now we can always return when we need to.

52

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:20,310
So let's run this line shift enter.

53

00:03:20,340  -->  00:03:24,360
And now let's run this line and let's see what it looks like.

54

00:03:24,360  -->  00:03:24,830
All right.

55

00:03:24,870  -->  00:03:29,430
We've just created the dictionary we haven't used the dictionary so let's go ahead and use a dictionary

56

00:03:29,820  -->  00:03:31,480
here instead of the color.

57

00:03:31,590  -->  00:03:34,650
We're going to say we're going to look up the color in the dictionary.

58

00:03:34,650  -->  00:03:38,820
So I'm gonna say dictionary and then look up based on the name.

59

00:03:38,850  -->  00:03:44,450
So every time a new name is passed that name is used to look up the color from the dictionary.

60

00:03:44,460  -->  00:03:48,140
So for now press shift enter shift enter here.

61

00:03:48,140  -->  00:03:54,780
You'll see that while everything is looking much better so now we can tell which players which by their

62

00:03:54,780  -->  00:03:57,350
color Kobe Bryant the brown James they're across.

63

00:03:57,450  -->  00:03:57,990
Awesome.

64

00:03:57,990  -->  00:04:02,910
So the only thing is that we know that some of these colors or every couple of colors actually used

65

00:04:02,910  -->  00:04:03,900
twice.

66

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:04,170
Right.

67

00:04:04,170  -->  00:04:08,800
So once we have players with the same color that's going to be confusing.

68

00:04:08,820  -->  00:04:15,090
So how can where else do we need to do we obviously need to fix up the markers as a small challenge

69

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:15,300
.

70

00:04:15,300  -->  00:04:19,230
I invite you to pose this video and try do that on your own.

71

00:04:19,260  -->  00:04:25,980
It's exactly the same process as we did with colors so try posing the video and fixing up the markers

72

00:04:26,400  -->  00:04:28,150
and then unpause the video on.

73

00:04:28,200  -->  00:04:34,080
Now I'm going to do that so we can do this advanced function design element together.

74

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:36,310
All right so we're going to create this picture.

75

00:04:36,330  -->  00:04:42,900
Well basically we're just going to copy this and we're going to say let's call it MRK for marker.

76

00:04:43,150  -->  00:04:45,550
And now we're going to go back here again.

77

00:04:45,600  -->  00:04:48,810
I will just copy this code like that.

78

00:04:49,140  -->  00:04:53,590
And that will allow us to put in the correct markers for every player.

79

00:04:53,640  -->  00:04:56,800
Right so s goes here.

80

00:04:57,000  -->  00:05:05,800
Here s then oh then the hat sign then D has a couple more.

81

00:05:05,810  -->  00:05:08,020
It's only six left s.

82

00:05:08,090  -->  00:05:13,080
Then they start cycling again o hat and D.

83

00:05:13,220  -->  00:05:15,760
And then again S and O.

84

00:05:16,010  -->  00:05:16,220
All right.

85

00:05:16,220  -->  00:05:18,950
So let's check that check that we got the same result.

86

00:05:18,950  -->  00:05:27,230
So Kobe Bryant s Joe Johnson all the brawne James the hat come or Mella Anthony D capital D Dwight Howard

87

00:05:27,290  -->  00:05:35,320
s Chris Bosh O Chris Paul the hat Kevin Durant d capital D Derrick Rose s Dwayne Wade.

88

00:05:35,370  -->  00:05:36,770
Oh all right.

89

00:05:36,770  -->  00:05:38,870
So hopefully you got that resolved as well.

90

00:05:39,140  -->  00:05:40,910
And now how do we look it up.

91

00:05:40,910  -->  00:05:48,830
We've got two marker instead of s here we just say marker and then we'll just say they like that.

92

00:05:48,890  -->  00:05:53,480
So now we can get rid of this code simply at the top.

93

00:05:53,780  -->  00:05:58,400
Again we are on this and we run this line again.

94

00:05:58,400  -->  00:06:04,820
You'll see that the markers have been fixed up as well as President of the Rander crows both have squares

95

00:06:05,150  -->  00:06:07,400
so we can actually add more in here.

96

00:06:07,430  -->  00:06:12,630
And by the way it doesn't matter in which order you add them so I can add Joe Johnson who usually on

97

00:06:12,650  -->  00:06:15,190
number on spot two I can add him here.

98

00:06:15,410  -->  00:06:21,410
Doesn't matter because it all fits into our algorithm anyway properly.

99

00:06:21,490  -->  00:06:27,620
And the plot look exactly the same as previously can see Joe Johnson was always red and with circles

100

00:06:27,770  -->  00:06:33,680
again Joe Johnson red circles only difference is that now he's at the bottom of the legend but that's

101

00:06:33,770  -->  00:06:36,100
the only difference to that other shot.

102

00:06:36,410  -->  00:06:37,200
So there we go.

103

00:06:37,220  -->  00:06:44,330
Now we have a fully working function my plot which accepts parameters and can build some players.

104

00:06:44,330  -->  00:06:51,680
The only thing that we have left to do if this function is we need to specify the fix up the input so

105

00:06:51,950  -->  00:06:59,450
we obviously need to allow the function to accept an input except that the matrix that we're going to

106

00:06:59,450  -->  00:07:00,910
be looking at as an input right.

107

00:07:00,920  -->  00:07:02,450
And that's very easy to do.

108

00:07:02,480  -->  00:07:09,530
All we have to do is let's just take this again and we'll say here fix up the inputs.

109

00:07:09,770  -->  00:07:14,320
So what we want to do is we want to add the Matrix and we're going to be looking at.

110

00:07:14,340  -->  00:07:16,120
And so we'll say we'll call it Dora.

111

00:07:16,340  -->  00:07:21,390
And now we want every time we specify so let's copy this.

112

00:07:21,480  -->  00:07:24,890
We're just going to add a new line here before running that one.

113

00:07:25,100  -->  00:07:28,880
So I'm going to remove Joe Johnson for now this is.

114

00:07:28,880  -->  00:07:30,110
These are the players.

115

00:07:30,230  -->  00:07:37,100
But also I want to say which matrix I want to look at so maybe I won't say I don't want to look at game

116

00:07:37,220  -->  00:07:39,690
for now maybe I want to look at points.

117

00:07:39,740  -->  00:07:47,120
So I want to ask people to say points and then I want to then only look at the players in that matrix

118

00:07:47,180  -->  00:07:53,750
so here points is going to be positive data and the list of players is going to be passed to the player

119

00:07:53,750  -->  00:07:54,520
list.

120

00:07:54,590  -->  00:07:58,830
So therefore Dhara has to go and replace games.

121

00:07:58,940  -->  00:07:59,450
Right.

122

00:07:59,480  -->  00:08:02,450
So now I know that this is the matrix I want to look at.

123

00:08:02,450  -->  00:08:05,940
Why are we looking at data why are we looking at games if it should be done.

124

00:08:05,960  -->  00:08:10,650
So it's as simple as that is simple substitution so points will go here.

125

00:08:10,790  -->  00:08:15,650
And then from here it also will be passed on to the function and from here it will go into the body

126

00:08:15,650  -->  00:08:17,830
of the function albis be replaced here.

127

00:08:17,840  -->  00:08:22,030
So if I if I say games here are games over here and then or your place here.

128

00:08:22,040  -->  00:08:25,670
So if I were on this line then around this line you'll see that.

129

00:08:25,670  -->  00:08:29,330
Now I've got the points visualized or I can say celery.

130

00:08:29,490  -->  00:08:30,460
Simple as that.

131

00:08:30,710  -->  00:08:32,480
So now I just rerun this line.

132

00:08:32,660  -->  00:08:36,360
You can see now I've got that salary visualization that we talked about before.

133

00:08:36,860  -->  00:08:42,950
And one last thing that we're going to do here before this function is fully ready and this and other

134

00:08:42,950  -->  00:08:49,920
advanced function design element is we going to say player list because players.

135

00:08:50,270  -->  00:08:51,100
What does that do.

136

00:08:51,230  -->  00:08:54,710
Well players as we know is just a list of players.

137

00:08:54,730  -->  00:08:56,560
If I just run players here.

138

00:08:56,720  -->  00:08:59,540
So it's basically just a list of all of the players.

139

00:08:59,540  -->  00:09:04,010
And what we're doing here is we're specifying a default value for the function.

140

00:09:04,010  -->  00:09:10,640
So if I don't pass a list of players if I just say something like that if I just say salary and I don't

141

00:09:10,640  -->  00:09:16,010
pass the actual list of players what'll happen is all I have to first of course are rerun my function

142

00:09:16,040  -->  00:09:16,270
.

143

00:09:16,490  -->  00:09:21,750
Now if I run this you will see that the salary for all of the players is specified.

144

00:09:22,010  -->  00:09:23,810
So those are very two simple adjustments.

145

00:09:23,810  -->  00:09:27,960
So basically we added the matrix that we want to look at and then replace it here.

146

00:09:28,010  -->  00:09:30,710
And also we were added a default parameter.

147

00:09:30,710  -->  00:09:33,580
So you know how in Python some functions have defined parameters.

148

00:09:33,740  -->  00:09:37,520
Well now our very own function also has a different parameter.

149

00:09:37,640  -->  00:09:43,910
And what we're doing here is we're saying if the player list is not passed to the function then by default

150

00:09:43,940  -->  00:09:50,000
take all of the players with the same effect you could specify certain players here you could say just

151

00:09:50,000  -->  00:09:55,490
LeBron James or specify your own list of players here interest in square brackets you could say let's

152

00:09:55,490  -->  00:09:58,850
say for instance only visualize Joe Johns.

153

00:09:58,850  -->  00:09:59,110
Right.

154

00:09:59,120  -->  00:10:05,630
So in that case if I run this line and on this you don't pass the salary or the names of the players

155

00:10:05,630  -->  00:10:09,050
then only Joe Johnson by default is visualized.

156

00:10:09,050  -->  00:10:18,680
If you do pass the list of players you should say Kobe Bryant and LeBron James then they will be visualized

157

00:10:18,680  -->  00:10:18,710
.

158

00:10:18,710  -->  00:10:19,310
Right.

159

00:10:19,310  -->  00:10:22,370
So again we're going to replace his back with players.

160

00:10:22,370  -->  00:10:27,680
So every time the list of players is not passed the function then all of the players will be visualized

161

00:10:27,680  -->  00:10:30,190
for that specific matrix that we're looking at.

162

00:10:30,200  -->  00:10:30,480
All right.

163

00:10:30,470  -->  00:10:31,920
Make sure to your on lines.

164

00:10:32,240  -->  00:10:33,730
And there we go.

165

00:10:33,740  -->  00:10:35,630
This is all ready.

166

00:10:35,660  -->  00:10:39,310
I'm just going to add Derrick Rose back in here.

167

00:10:39,440  -->  00:10:40,580
This is all ready.

168

00:10:40,600  -->  00:10:41,890
The function is ready to go.

169

00:10:41,900  -->  00:10:44,880
And we are ready to proceed with the insights.

170

00:10:44,960  -->  00:10:50,360
It's going to be a fun process exploring inside and looking for patterns and anomalies.

171

00:10:50,360  -->  00:10:54,680
Can't wait to get started on that tutorial and play around with this for now.

172

00:10:54,680  -->  00:10:57,380
Just make sure that everything is that we've covered.

173

00:10:57,380  -->  00:11:03,270
Makes total sense because from here we going to focus on the analytic side of things.

174

00:11:03,320  -->  00:11:07,850
We're pretty much done with the coding for this part of the Course code.

175

00:11:07,890  -->  00:11:08,730
See you next time.

176

00:11:08,750  -->  00:11:10,250
Until then decoding
