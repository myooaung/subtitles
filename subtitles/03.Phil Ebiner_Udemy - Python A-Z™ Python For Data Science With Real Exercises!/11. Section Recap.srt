00:00:05,270  -->  00:00:07,740
Blown Welcome back to the course in Python programming.

2

00:00:07,890  -->  00:00:11,180
I hope you enjoyed the section that we've just completed.

3

00:00:11,190  -->  00:00:14,220
And today we're going to quickly recap on what we learned.

4

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:21,330
So in this section we learned the Bourne importing data into Python so finally finally we've covered

5

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:28,260
enough materials in this course in order to have learned how to import into Python.

6

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:34,950
I was very excited to discuss that Tauriel two together walk through importing darent Python and we

7

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:40,110
looked at several methods where you can just specify the full path to the file or you can change your

8

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:41,150
working directory.

9

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:45,300
And also we looked at doing that in Windows and in the MacBook.

10

00:00:45,420  -->  00:00:50,640
And I must say that's in a lot of other courses and tutorials you'll find out there.

11

00:00:50,670  -->  00:00:55,790
This is one of the topics discussed is discussed at the very start of the course.

12

00:00:55,920  -->  00:01:02,580
But personally I think that it is a great approach to only introduce the import of data when we're ready

13

00:01:02,580  -->  00:01:02,890
for it.

14

00:01:02,910  -->  00:01:05,730
And this time we were because we already knew about functions.

15

00:01:05,730  -->  00:01:08,480
We were quite comfortable with coding in Jupiter.

16

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:10,370
And we were ready to do it.

17

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:18,480
And so now going forward you'll be able to import data sets your own data sets through CACP files whenever

18

00:01:18,630  -->  00:01:20,360
you need to work with them in Python.

19

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:22,080
So congratulations on that.

20

00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:28,500
This is a very very big step which opens up the world of data science in Python to you.

21

00:01:28,500  -->  00:01:36,870
Next we learned about doorframes Why are pandas and the bandas is the main package that we learned to

22

00:01:36,870  -->  00:01:41,950
use for our friends and we will be using then we learned how to explore data set.

23

00:01:41,950  -->  00:01:46,860
So we learned about the head function that tail function that in full function which is similar to the

24

00:01:46,860  -->  00:01:48,310
summary function in our.

25

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:54,060
And we learn about the described function which is kind of like the SDR restructure function in our

26

00:01:54,060  -->  00:01:54,540
.

27

00:01:54,540  -->  00:01:58,290
Then we talked about renaming columns of a doorframe.

28

00:01:58,380  -->  00:02:04,530
We learned about subsetting doorframes we learned about basic operations with a door frame so we talked

29

00:02:04,530  -->  00:02:08,070
about things like deleting columns adding columns into doorframes.

30

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:13,980
Then we talked about the 80 and 80 functions which allow us to access individual elements of a door

31

00:02:14,000  -->  00:02:14,740
frame.

32

00:02:14,910  -->  00:02:21,210
And this was an advanced tutorial and we learned the difference between the two and how to not get caught

33

00:02:21,300  -->  00:02:27,120
up in that trap of using the wrong one of these functions in certain doorframes.

34

00:02:27,120  -->  00:02:32,170
Then we talked about filtering doorframes a very important concept in data size.

35

00:02:32,170  -->  00:02:36,750
So filching is very similar to filtering in Excel except for that here and we have to code it so we

36

00:02:36,750  -->  00:02:42,720
have to grade that filter and pass it to the door frame it can look a bit complex when you look at it

37

00:02:42,720  -->  00:02:46,580
filter door frame the code for a two doorframe and for the first time.

38

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:48,880
But the way we introduced it was step by step.

39

00:02:48,990  -->  00:02:55,560
We first learned how to create the filter and then how to parse it to a doorframes So hopefully that

40

00:02:55,560  -->  00:03:01,290
all made sense it's all clear what exactly is going on in the background when you're filtering a doorframe

41

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:02,190
in Python.

42

00:03:02,190  -->  00:03:07,860
Then we had our introduction to Seaborn seaborne is a weasel zation package for Python some very powerful

43

00:03:07,860  -->  00:03:08,650
realisations.

44

00:03:08,790  -->  00:03:14,460
And as you'll see in the next section of the course we will be working with some very interesting very

45

00:03:14,520  -->  00:03:21,630
unique type of missiles that the seaborne makes very easy to create So that's going to be a very very

46

00:03:21,630  -->  00:03:25,140
exciting couple of tutorials in the next section.

47

00:03:25,140  -->  00:03:29,910
Also we talked about keyword arguments in the section of the core skewered arguments are arguments that

48

00:03:29,940  -->  00:03:36,210
can be passed to functions through dictionaries so there was a very practical use case for the dictionary

49

00:03:36,210  -->  00:03:39,060
knowledge that we developed in the previous section of the course.

50

00:03:39,180  -->  00:03:45,570
So I hope you enjoyed the section this was definitely a very fundamental section for darte assigns because

51

00:03:45,600  -->  00:03:51,120
indeed you will be working with doorframes a lot in your career.

52

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:55,590
That is the main way that relational data sets are represented.

53

00:03:55,590  -->  00:04:00,990
So we took us quite a bit to get here first we talked about lists which was a stepping stone for us

54

00:04:00,990  -->  00:04:06,330
to talk about arrays which was a stepping stone for Osterwald matrices which were a stepping stone for

55

00:04:06,330  -->  00:04:08,830
us to move onto doorframes finally.

56

00:04:08,880  -->  00:04:12,980
And so this is our main main fundamental concept.

57

00:04:12,990  -->  00:04:19,140
Doorframes and how to import data into Python and further in the course will be heavily relying on all

58

00:04:19,170  -->  00:04:24,230
this while we're discovering new topics Conway to see in the next section of the Course.

59

00:04:24,270  -->  00:04:25,590
Until then happy coding
