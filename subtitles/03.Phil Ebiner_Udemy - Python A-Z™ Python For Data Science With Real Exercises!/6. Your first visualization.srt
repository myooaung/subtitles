00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:07,890
Hello and welcome back to the course in Python programming.

2

00:00:08,150  -->  00:00:10,170
Two quick recap on the previous tutorial.

3

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:14,820
This is the solution the proposed solution for the mini homework exercise.

4

00:00:14,880  -->  00:00:21,420
So to calculate player accuracy we took field goals divided by field goal attempts and then what I did

5

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:27,930
here is I use their own function but I rounded to two decimal points and then multiplied by 100 to get

6

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:28,440
percentage.

7

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:32,550
So these values here are percentages in terms of play accuracy.

8

00:00:32,550  -->  00:00:38,420
How many basketballs they get in the net out of the attempts that they take at the shot.

9

00:00:38,670  -->  00:00:43,620
So there we go and using the same principles as we discussed with the dictionaries we can create a similar

10

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:47,220
approach to Xs different players and different seasons.

11

00:00:47,220  -->  00:00:52,380
One thing you'll notice is that even though we have all the data it is pretty hard to navigate because

12

00:00:52,380  -->  00:00:55,660
these matrices don't have column names or row names.

13

00:00:55,680  -->  00:01:01,560
It's pretty tedious to always find that the player always finds their daughter we can still do it but

14

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:07,470
it's just not as intuitive and not as simple and at the same time we can even though we have the data

15

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:13,830
we can really see the trends is so much information here that we get distracted and we don't see what's

16

00:01:13,830  -->  00:01:14,250
going on.

17

00:01:14,250  -->  00:01:20,220
And even though in this table as we will see further down in this section of the Course is a very interesting

18

00:01:20,220  -->  00:01:24,840
trend happening right now we can't really spot it with just by looking at the table.

19

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:31,500
So the question is how do we proceed how do we derive insights as a scientist how do we analyze this

20

00:01:31,500  -->  00:01:33,610
information to derive their insights.

21

00:01:33,810  -->  00:01:38,120
And that is a great segue into the topic for today which is Alsation.

22

00:01:38,130  -->  00:01:43,710
So today we're going to build our first installation and we'll finally start putting these tables of

23

00:01:43,710  -->  00:01:49,950
data into plots which will allow us to see trends and anomalies and find out what we want to investigate

24

00:01:49,950  -->  00:01:50,390
further.

25

00:01:50,490  -->  00:01:54,080
So quite an exciting tour ahead actually very exciting story ahead.

26

00:01:54,120  -->  00:01:55,880
Let's get started.

27

00:01:55,950  -->  00:01:59,750
In order to start building recessions we're going to first need to do some imports.

28

00:01:59,760  -->  00:02:02,380
We're going to be our standard import of an umpire.

29

00:02:02,500  -->  00:02:06,290
And I say standard because it's already become quite normal that we do it.

30

00:02:06,300  -->  00:02:10,280
And in fact we don't really have to do it because we've imported before.

31

00:02:10,320  -->  00:02:12,530
Up up top here somewhere.

32

00:02:12,630  -->  00:02:17,130
We don't really need to do it again or we can just rely on that but as a habit which is going to put

33

00:02:17,130  -->  00:02:25,240
it here and another imported it will definitely need is a mat plot lib and Dot pie Plaut as GLT.

34

00:02:25,260  -->  00:02:30,690
So once again my plot lib comes in the Anaconda distribution so the way we installed Python in this

35

00:02:30,690  -->  00:02:35,880
course if you installed Python in a different manner then you might need to download and install this

36

00:02:35,880  -->  00:02:40,480
package separately or put it on your computer and then you'll be able to import it.

37

00:02:40,860  -->  00:02:46,380
But otherwise if you're falling along tutorials you can simply run these two lines and that will give

38

00:02:46,380  -->  00:02:47,890
you some pie as MP.

39

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:50,590
And my Pipelet as PLDT.

40

00:02:50,600  -->  00:02:56,280
Another thing that we'll need to do in order to proceed because we are using Jupiter notebooks we need

41

00:02:56,280  -->  00:03:04,050
to specify this line and plot lebe in line and what that will do is it will put the plots in the actual

42

00:03:04,050  -->  00:03:09,450
Japan notebooks rather than putting them in a separate window which can get quite annoying.

43

00:03:09,450  -->  00:03:13,620
So if you're using def Japan or notebook's then definitely specify this line and run it.

44

00:03:13,690  -->  00:03:15,970
You don't need to do that once just as with the imports.

45

00:03:16,110  -->  00:03:21,190
And that way the Plus we're going to be creating are going to be shown inside your notebooks.

46

00:03:21,210  -->  00:03:21,480
All right.

47

00:03:21,480  -->  00:03:22,790
So let's get started.

48

00:03:22,800  -->  00:03:26,610
We're going to create our very first plot how we're going to do this.

49

00:03:26,760  -->  00:03:29,500
Well in order to create plot we're going to say T Dot.

50

00:03:29,520  -->  00:03:35,760
And here you can click tap which will bring your pop up and I'll show you all the different items available

51

00:03:35,790  -->  00:03:38,220
inside appeal to you which is pipelined.

52

00:03:38,580  -->  00:03:41,700
And the one we are after is called Just basically Plaut.

53

00:03:41,700  -->  00:03:48,510
So if you're here this is the one we're after the Zarian tab where was it BLT.

54

00:03:48,510  -->  00:03:51,830
So just plot and we'll just basically type it up there.

55

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:53,220
That's what we after.

56

00:03:53,460  -->  00:03:57,630
Inside the sport like I know there's going to be quite a lot of new stuff right now.

57

00:03:57,660  -->  00:04:04,800
Just bear with me we'll go through it bit by bit and then we will see how this plot is coming to life

58

00:04:04,800  -->  00:04:04,830
.

59

00:04:04,830  -->  00:04:05,130
All right.

60

00:04:05,130  -->  00:04:09,960
So first thing is we need to supply some daughter to this plot and we're going to supply salary.

61

00:04:09,960  -->  00:04:15,590
So from our salary matrix we can take the first role which is Kobe Bryant's salaries right.

62

00:04:15,600  -->  00:04:20,200
So this finished typing of course salary first row or row number 0.

63

00:04:20,310  -->  00:04:25,740
So if I just run that by itself you'll see that if we already have a very descriptive plot so we can

64

00:04:25,740  -->  00:04:30,660
see that Kobe Bryant's salary started here at 1.6 even though we can't really tell what this 1.6 means

65

00:04:30,660  -->  00:04:36,420
right now and went all the way up to three to tell what the 1.6 means which is go to salary.

66

00:04:36,520  -->  00:04:39,190
Just quickly have a look at what we have you there.

67

00:04:39,420  -->  00:04:47,820
So 1.6 is basically it means 16 million dollars and thirty three is actually 30 million dollars.

68

00:04:47,820  -->  00:04:48,220
All right.

69

00:04:48,270  -->  00:04:50,050
So just for our reference.

70

00:04:50,160  -->  00:04:54,630
So that's the very basic things so you can really see that it's quite a smart function.

71

00:04:54,630  -->  00:04:59,510
It takes a salary which is just be basically a list of numbers as we saw.

72

00:04:59,700  -->  00:05:06,570
And it puts into Plaut so it knows to add these on the x axis and then plot the values on the y axis

73

00:05:06,570  -->  00:05:06,600
.

74

00:05:06,600  -->  00:05:08,430
So it's already quite interesting.

75

00:05:08,870  -->  00:05:10,430
So let's start building on top of that.

76

00:05:10,440  -->  00:05:12,080
We're going to give us a color.

77

00:05:12,150  -->  00:05:16,230
So C stands for color it's a parameter for this function we're going to say black.

78

00:05:16,230  -->  00:05:21,050
So if you run this now you'll see that the plot is the line has become black.

79

00:05:21,060  -->  00:05:22,950
LS stands for line style.

80

00:05:22,950  -->  00:05:24,340
What we want is dasht.

81

00:05:24,360  -->  00:05:27,510
So just put two minuses for on this.

82

00:05:27,660  -->  00:05:29,700
You'll see that now it's dasht.

83

00:05:29,700  -->  00:05:34,260
So we kind of styling our plot as we're going then what we want.

84

00:05:34,260  -->  00:05:35,430
We want a marker.

85

00:05:35,760  -->  00:05:41,520
And you'll see why in a bit because we're going to soon have more lines on this plot so let's put a

86

00:05:41,520  -->  00:05:47,190
marker and S stands for square and it's very simple to look all these things up so you can just look

87

00:05:47,190  -->  00:05:49,710
up plot lines styles.

88

00:05:49,720  -->  00:05:55,380
You'll get different codes for like cells and get different codes for markers the same way it's all

89

00:05:55,380  -->  00:05:58,280
in the documentation can be found on line.

90

00:05:58,290  -->  00:06:04,530
So then we can say M-S which stands for marker size that say 7 which kind of is already seven.

91

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:07,710
So just to show something you can see can increase them.

92

00:06:07,740  -->  00:06:10,890
We can say 17 or just keep it at seven.

93

00:06:10,890  -->  00:06:12,950
OK so that's that's a good start.

94

00:06:13,170  -->  00:06:16,030
What else we want here is we want to get rid of this line.

95

00:06:16,140  -->  00:06:18,380
It's just showing it because we're sending the object.

96

00:06:18,390  -->  00:06:26,030
You know how we use print to print values so here you would say peel t dots show instead of just sending

97

00:06:26,030  -->  00:06:27,260
the object into the output.

98

00:06:27,270  -->  00:06:28,970
And that gets rid of that line.

99

00:06:29,340  -->  00:06:30,220
So it looks good.

100

00:06:30,330  -->  00:06:35,070
And one more thing I wanted to do is I want to kind of make it bigger so expand it to the right.

101

00:06:35,070  -->  00:06:36,910
We've got a bit of space so do that.

102

00:06:36,990  -->  00:06:39,590
Now that's also a line that we just need to run once.

103

00:06:39,610  -->  00:06:44,060
Is this just step put up its VLT dot our C programs.

104

00:06:44,070  -->  00:06:50,130
So basically we are setting the parameters of our session figure big size is just something that needs

105

00:06:50,130  -->  00:06:50,900
to be remembered.

106

00:06:50,910  -->  00:06:51,610
Yes.

107

00:06:51,840  -->  00:06:53,680
Or you can always look it up when you need to.

108

00:06:53,700  -->  00:06:59,040
And so now if I run this you will see that it's a bit bigger so it's been stretched outside if you want

109

00:06:59,040  -->  00:07:04,230
to make it even more bigger especially if you're not zoomed into a browser then you can definitely make

110

00:07:04,230  -->  00:07:06,470
it bigger here so change it to six.

111

00:07:06,570  -->  00:07:08,730
You'll see that it's starting to take up more space.

112

00:07:08,790  -->  00:07:13,230
But I want to save some space and still I want to be zoomed in so that we can see all the codes.

113

00:07:13,240  -->  00:07:18,750
I want to I'll just keep it at 8 4 so these things again there's no need to actually remember them off

114

00:07:18,750  -->  00:07:19,260
by heart.

115

00:07:19,260  -->  00:07:23,150
You can always just look them up when you're plotting to change your size.

116

00:07:23,160  -->  00:07:24,210
And it's not the only way.

117

00:07:24,210  -->  00:07:26,120
So there's other ways to change the size of the plot.

118

00:07:26,130  -->  00:07:29,010
But for now this will be sufficient for us.

119

00:07:29,320  -->  00:07:29,580
OK.

120

00:07:29,590  -->  00:07:30,830
So that's a good start.

121

00:07:30,830  -->  00:07:34,180
What we want to do next is we'll just copy this over here.

122

00:07:34,350  -->  00:07:39,920
And what we want to do next is we want to add the takes on the horizontal axis so we don't want 0 to

123

00:07:39,920  -->  00:07:40,200
9.

124

00:07:40,200  -->  00:07:41,850
We want the actual dates.

125

00:07:42,000  -->  00:07:48,810
So the way to do that is to use T-Dog X ticks and the way we're kind of approaching this is all zation

126

00:07:48,810  -->  00:07:54,330
charges so much learning about exertion will definitely jump into visualization in more detail in further

127

00:07:54,330  -->  00:07:55,970
in one of the further sections of the course.

128

00:07:55,980  -->  00:07:59,920
For now we're just learning the bits that we need specifically for this challenge.

129

00:07:59,940  -->  00:08:04,240
I'm going to explain as much as I can and that will give us a head start and fizzles.

130

00:08:04,260  -->  00:08:09,240
Even though we won't know everything we'll know how these things are structured and that's a very valuable

131

00:08:09,240  -->  00:08:10,440
skill to have.

132

00:08:10,440  -->  00:08:15,910
So just follow along with the code and I'm going to now and these tic marks.

133

00:08:15,930  -->  00:08:20,510
So in order to tick marks what we want is ultimately you want the seasons right.

134

00:08:20,510  -->  00:08:26,290
So we have this season's list which has the years we want it to be displayed here right.

135

00:08:26,310  -->  00:08:33,960
So what we want in to specify for X-Tex is what is the output and also what should be replaced.

136

00:08:33,970  -->  00:08:39,600
So we need to replace Are we going to actually create as we learned way back at the start of the course

137

00:08:39,630  -->  00:08:42,900
we're going to create a range so great in your line.

138

00:08:42,900  -->  00:08:46,620
So if I run range by itself and pie from a point.

139

00:08:46,890  -->  00:08:49,020
It's the same as x range in Python 2.

140

00:08:49,020  -->  00:08:54,570
So basically this is not a list yet in order to turn it into lists you have to do that.

141

00:08:54,570  -->  00:08:58,570
So basically what this is is just base a list of numbers 0 1 2 8.

142

00:08:58,560  -->  00:09:02,280
Actually we need a zero to 10 to 8.

143

00:09:02,310  -->  00:09:06,190
So there we go that's a list of numbers and I'm placing it in here.

144

00:09:06,540  -->  00:09:11,420
And then I want I'm saying that for the ticks I wanted to see the season's not the numbers.

145

00:09:11,430  -->  00:09:16,040
So if I run this now you'll see that I actually have the seasons and we can get rid of this.

146

00:09:16,260  -->  00:09:22,790
And one more thing you can do just for aesthetic reasons we can say rotation equals vertical.

147

00:09:22,830  -->  00:09:29,710
So as you can see it's all pretty intuitive stuff and they try to use very intuitive words as well so

148

00:09:29,740  -->  00:09:31,090
rotation of vertical.

149

00:09:31,110  -->  00:09:33,650
There we go so we've now tethered these around.

150

00:09:33,840  -->  00:09:38,340
One more thing that we're going to add here is we're going to say a label we're going to label this

151

00:09:38,340  -->  00:09:38,880
line.

152

00:09:38,880  -->  00:09:44,450
I know it doesn't really matter right now because we only have one player on this chart.

153

00:09:44,460  -->  00:09:48,480
But going forward we will have more so we will need that.

154

00:09:48,510  -->  00:09:54,570
And again because we want to make it as generic as possible we are specifying south through the salary

155

00:09:54,570  -->  00:09:56,050
matrix so we could have just said.

156

00:09:56,150  -->  00:10:02,310
And here there are players who have just said Kobe Bryant as text right so as said Kobe Bryant because

157

00:10:02,310  -->  00:10:03,270
we know that it's him.

158

00:10:03,480  -->  00:10:08,940
But at the same time we just want to be able to then replicate the same line for other players so it's

159

00:10:08,940  -->  00:10:11,650
just easier if we specify it through the players list.

160

00:10:11,910  -->  00:10:17,850
So far on that you'll see that nothing pretty much has changed but that label has been saved for that

161

00:10:17,850  -->  00:10:19,100
specific line.

162

00:10:19,380  -->  00:10:27,240
So there we go that's we wanted to do in terms of the box itself going forward what we want to add to

163

00:10:27,240  -->  00:10:33,630
this lot is we're going to start adding other players so that we can compare them side by side and we'll

164

00:10:33,630  -->  00:10:36,810
get started on that in the next Tauriel right away.

165

00:10:36,810  -->  00:10:41,970
But for now if you would like to play around what you could do is you could just change the player here

166

00:10:41,960  -->  00:10:48,150
or you could just change this and this value is 0 and 0 here and see what you get.

167

00:10:48,150  -->  00:10:51,050
So you can you'll get different charts for different players.

168

00:10:51,270  -->  00:10:55,430
But then we get to change it back so we can continue straight from here in the next tutorial.

169

00:10:55,740  -->  00:10:57,480
And I look forward seeing you next time.

170

00:10:57,480  -->  00:11:02,120
Until then happy coding.
