00:00:04.840  -->  00:00:05.710
Alone.

2

00:00:05.730  -->  00:00:08.200
Welcome back to the Python programming course.

3

00:00:08.220  -->  00:00:09.840
Today we're moving on.

4

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:11.110
We're seaborne.

5

00:00:11.280  -->  00:00:17.070
So Proustian we looked at a few examples just to get to know someone a little bit and understand what

6

00:00:17.070  -->  00:00:19.350
it's all about how it works.

7

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:23.540
I looked at a few really great examples in the gallery but today we'll proceed.

8

00:00:23.620  -->  00:00:26.070
We're actually working on our challenge.

9

00:00:26.190  -->  00:00:28.830
So let's move to it right away.

10

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:33.610
First thing we're going to do is we're going to start our plot and as we remember we need to plot.

11

00:00:33.660  -->  00:00:36.850
Internet users by birth date birth rate by Internet users.

12

00:00:36.850  -->  00:00:42.870
So we want to see if there's any kind of patterns that we can observe when we plot those two parameters

13

00:00:42.930  -->  00:00:43.890
against each other.

14

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:45.530
So let's go ahead and do that right away.

15

00:00:45.760  -->  00:00:48.520
This three equals s n s which is going to continue.

16

00:00:48.570  -->  00:00:54.920
Numeration s and the one we need this time so shift Taieb are actually s and as dots tab.

17

00:00:55.170  -->  00:00:59.420
And if you scroll down scroll down the one we need is called alleged plot.

18

00:00:59.430  -->  00:00:59.670
All right.

19

00:00:59.700  -->  00:01:09.420
I'll just type it in l m plot l m plot and L M stands for linear model and your model plot and what

20

00:01:09.420  -->  00:01:16.650
we want is we want to posit some dorso and say stats and then here we get two parameters shift tab you'll

21

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:24.120
see this expand this plot and Dot and regression model fits across a facet grid et cetera et cetera

22

00:01:24.130  -->  00:01:24.220
.

23

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:27.050
So here we've got x y and data.

24

00:01:27.120  -->  00:01:30.090
So the in and it come in this order.

25

00:01:30.090  -->  00:01:35.820
Personally I'm kind of used to specifying data first and then so that you get it out of the way and

26

00:01:35.820  -->  00:01:37.730
then specify the columns.

27

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:38.240
You can do it.

28

00:01:38.250  -->  00:01:43.290
Either way you'll see quite a lot of examples on the internet or other people specifying it this way

29

00:01:43.290  -->  00:01:51.090
they'll say X equals Internet users so let's put ingenues on the x axis and white equals birthrate that's

30

00:01:51.090  -->  00:01:52.750
going to be the y axis.

31

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:54.400
So a lot of people do it this way.

32

00:01:54.480  -->  00:01:58.700
Let's run that you'll see there it is so that's Israeli-Jews is birthrate.

33

00:01:58.710  -->  00:02:01.710
And that's that's the linear model this regression model.

34

00:02:01.950  -->  00:02:07.590
But personally I'd prefer it to do it the way you do it and are you put the dot at the start so that

35

00:02:07.620  -->  00:02:09.400
you kind of get get it out of the way.

36

00:02:09.450  -->  00:02:09.900
Right.

37

00:02:10.010  -->  00:02:14.670
You already know just by looking at this you know which doctors that working with and then everything

38

00:02:14.670  -->  00:02:16.500
else comes later.

39

00:02:16.530  -->  00:02:17.520
I find this approach better.

40

00:02:17.520  -->  00:02:22.470
It doesn't matter again if you specifying the names of the parameters it doesn't matter in which order

41

00:02:22.520  -->  00:02:25.610
you are specifying them you could specify a new order.

42

00:02:25.650  -->  00:02:31.530
You will start running into problems if you don't specify the name because if it does and them you can

43

00:02:31.530  -->  00:02:34.630
see that first is supposed for x and y then dadda.

44

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:39.930
So if you don't specify Dadda equals x equals and y equals then you need to specify that order.

45

00:02:40.050  -->  00:02:46.110
But otherwise if you are specifying the names which is a good habit to do it to have that's OK you can

46

00:02:46.110  -->  00:02:47.550
do it and either in either order.

47

00:02:47.550  -->  00:02:49.620
So there we go that's plot's.

48

00:02:49.650  -->  00:02:57.750
Obviously we don't say it's not already and it doesn't look like a linear relationship as we will get

49

00:02:57.750  -->  00:02:58.860
closer.

50

00:02:58.860  -->  00:03:01.800
We'll zoom in and see this a bit closer.

51

00:03:01.800  -->  00:03:04.650
You'll notice that it's not a linear relation.

52

00:03:04.680  -->  00:03:09.460
I don't think it is one so fitting a linear regression model here doesn't make a lot of sense so it

53

00:03:09.460  -->  00:03:12.750
is going to say is a parameter so you could shift tab here.

54

00:03:12.840  -->  00:03:18.510
It's very useful in the Juber notebooks that you can click shift tab and just get all of this help in

55

00:03:18.510  -->  00:03:24.200
or for example you have to type in the question mark and run an operation so that's it brings it up

56

00:03:24.230  -->  00:03:24.310
.

57

00:03:24.380  -->  00:03:27.740
But Windows also pre's will but I find this very handy so you can.

58

00:03:27.750  -->  00:03:30.640
And then it just disappears doesn't take up space on your screen.

59

00:03:30.930  -->  00:03:36.880
So the one we want here and the parameter we're looking for as you get it is lots of parameters.

60

00:03:37.290  -->  00:03:43.460
The parameter that we want where it is it's is called fits.

61

00:03:43.590  -->  00:03:45.080
There is a regression.

62

00:03:45.090  -->  00:03:49.830
So we're going to be as you can see by default it's true we want to set it to full so that the line

63

00:03:49.830  -->  00:03:50.460
disappears.

64

00:03:50.480  -->  00:03:51.290
It's not there.

65

00:03:51.500  -->  00:03:58.970
So let's go ahead to that fit or regression equals false or on that I did something wrong.

66

00:03:59.010  -->  00:04:03.170
OK so obviously look me shift tab again.

67

00:04:03.470  -->  00:04:05.560
Yup sometimes Vinterberg.

68

00:04:05.640  -->  00:04:08.660
So introgression Greg you're on that.

69

00:04:08.670  -->  00:04:09.340
There we go.

70

00:04:09.480  -->  00:04:14.400
That's our regression or that's that's whole plot to fault the regression.

71

00:04:14.400  -->  00:04:18.780
And the other thing I want to do is we want to break it up into income groups right.

72

00:04:18.780  -->  00:04:21.530
So right now we can really tell there is a pattern.

73

00:04:21.540  -->  00:04:28.590
So you can see that the more internet users you have in a country the lower the birthrate are here and

74

00:04:28.590  -->  00:04:34.380
the more birthrates the less energy is the higher the birthrate So it looks like there is kind of a

75

00:04:34.380  -->  00:04:38.060
pattern and looks like a one over X type of relationship.

76

00:04:38.370  -->  00:04:45.000
And also you can see it here in internet users we have a cluster here at 20 and then it's consistent

77

00:04:45.000  -->  00:04:46.190
and then drops off.

78

00:04:46.200  -->  00:04:47.940
So let's see if we see that here as well.

79

00:04:47.940  -->  00:04:51.810
So this is like the same Plourde but nice and stretched out.

80

00:04:51.840  -->  00:04:57.900
So here that's a cluster there then it it's consistent then drops off right and then you could plot's

81

00:04:57.960  -->  00:04:58.520
by the way.

82

00:04:58.540  -->  00:04:59.640
Here's a quick challenge for you.

83

00:04:59.680  -->  00:05:05.910
Do the same plot for any sort of introduces dude for birthrate and see if you can find how it looks

84

00:05:05.970  -->  00:05:06.080
.

85

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:07.850
So help you out with that.

86

00:05:08.500  -->  00:05:10.160
This I'm also curious.

87

00:05:10.170  -->  00:05:11.790
Now let's do this.

88

00:05:11.780  -->  00:05:13.750
And here I will say this.

89

00:05:13.970  -->  00:05:16.430
So we've done this three there's going to be four.

90

00:05:16.700  -->  00:05:21.980
And instead of three inches is a safe birth rate and you'll see that here with we're afraid we've got

91

00:05:21.990  -->  00:05:22.420
a hump.

92

00:05:22.430  -->  00:05:27.830
And then we've got a bit of a hump here as well so we're afraid we've got a lot of countries here even

93

00:05:27.830  -->  00:05:30.200
though you can really tell that there's so many.

94

00:05:30.260  -->  00:05:30.630
Oh no.

95

00:05:30.680  -->  00:05:33.780
Actually we're on my bed so this is 10.

96

00:05:33.810  -->  00:05:37.690
That's where the countries are so that's a lot of countries because this way of course.

97

00:05:37.760  -->  00:05:39.720
So that's where this is.

98

00:05:39.730  -->  00:05:42.440
And then this be it is actually over here.

99

00:05:42.480  -->  00:05:43.240
Interesting.

100

00:05:43.310  -->  00:05:46.720
Anyway so I'm going to delete this because that's not part of the plan.

101

00:05:46.740  -->  00:05:55.620
The plan is to get this to the next stage and next stage for this chart is add some color so let's add

102

00:05:55.620  -->  00:05:59.450
some color I'm going to put the backslash here and add a newline comma.

103

00:05:59.690  -->  00:06:06.680
Whew hew is the parameter for color income group around that you'll see that.

104

00:06:06.690  -->  00:06:09.850
Now it's got color and we've got the high income group.

105

00:06:09.890  -->  00:06:11.230
They're all sitting over here.

106

00:06:11.370  -->  00:06:14.370
Lots of introducers low birthrate.

107

00:06:14.390  -->  00:06:19.830
They've got the low income group sitting over here low Internet uses high birth rates.

108

00:06:20.120  -->  00:06:23.490
And then you got the lower middle income and the higher men upper middle income.

109

00:06:23.540  -->  00:06:30.500
It's just funny that it sounds like when people have Internet they don't have time to make kids or like

110

00:06:31.130  -->  00:06:33.930
have children when they have no internet.

111

00:06:33.930  -->  00:06:40.610
They have lots of time to create children and raise them and take care of them so very very interesting

112

00:06:40.620  -->  00:06:42.420
concept of course.

113

00:06:42.410  -->  00:06:45.050
Correlation does not imply causation.

114

00:06:45.250  -->  00:06:50.610
And they can be other reasons why it's like that because these are first of all countries and they have

115

00:06:50.730  -->  00:06:51.790
access to Internet.

116

00:06:51.810  -->  00:06:57.540
And but at the same time there are other social purpose perhaps reasons why people don't have that many

117

00:06:57.530  -->  00:06:58.020
children.

118

00:06:58.040  -->  00:07:01.820
And then the opposite happens in the low income countries.

119

00:07:01.870  -->  00:07:07.550
They're still developing worlds which don't have access to Internet and for against social or traditional

120

00:07:07.560  -->  00:07:07.910
reasons.

121

00:07:07.910  -->  00:07:11.960
They have lots of children but it's just an interesting observation.

122

00:07:12.140  -->  00:07:15.570
And the other thing that we wanted to do is increase the size.

123

00:07:15.630  -->  00:07:20.600
What you'll notice is that this size has increased in size has increased.

124

00:07:20.610  -->  00:07:22.360
These charges have increased in size.

125

00:07:22.440  -->  00:07:25.940
This one for some reason hasn't increased and I'll prove it to you.

126

00:07:25.940  -->  00:07:35.400
I can even change this to let's say 10 4 and let's say or let's say 10 10 8 even if I were on that around

127

00:07:35.470  -->  00:07:38.260
on this you'll see that this one grows quite a lot.

128

00:07:38.510  -->  00:07:42.180
And then if I run this line again this one doesn't change at all.

129

00:07:42.410  -->  00:07:47.880
So what's going on there why is this parameter being ignored is going to replaces back with 8:04 so

130

00:07:47.880  -->  00:07:51.980
it doesn't mess up our future charts and rerun all of that.

131

00:07:51.990  -->  00:07:56.700
So what's going on why is this function LMP not ignoring that parameter.

132

00:07:57.000  -->  00:08:03.000
Great question let's look at shift tab here and you open it up you'll see that poor daughter in regression

133

00:08:03.000  -->  00:08:09.680
model and then as we got this line fits across a facet grid so Felson grid is something we'll talk about

134

00:08:09.720  -->  00:08:15.570
further down in the course what a facet grid is basically when you have like lots of these charts together

135

00:08:15.560  -->  00:08:21.230
so you have a chart and another one like side by side and they come in a grid because you're changing

136

00:08:21.240  -->  00:08:25.930
some parameter across there those different charts and therefore there's like a grid of nine shots or

137

00:08:25.920  -->  00:08:26.530
something.

138

00:08:26.730  -->  00:08:33.630
And therefore Fassett grids they take up a lot of space and they like the seaborne guys decided that

139

00:08:34.080  -->  00:08:40.920
they need their own parameter inchers to control the size of these charts because it's it has to be

140

00:08:40.910  -->  00:08:41.840
very precise.

141

00:08:41.880  -->  00:08:45.090
So that's why here to change the size I'm zoomed in right here.

142

00:08:45.570  -->  00:08:51.770
You just say size equals ten for instance and that will increase the size here.

143

00:08:51.770  -->  00:08:58.010
And also another parameter you gets to play around with is aspect is the proportions of the width and

144

00:08:58.010  -->  00:08:58.310
height.

145

00:08:58.320  -->  00:09:02.500
So by default that's one that's aspect one to one.

146

00:09:02.820  -->  00:09:08.900
But what we can change it to is we can say like it's set to for example then it gets straight shut this

147

00:09:08.900  -->  00:09:13.550
way or you can say 0.5 and you get stretched out this way.

148

00:09:13.740  -->  00:09:15.540
So we're going to leave it at.

149

00:09:15.730  -->  00:09:16.680
We're going to take it out.

150

00:09:16.700  -->  00:09:21.960
We're not going to change the aspect parameter but it's a good level of control that you get over your

151

00:09:22.020  -->  00:09:25.090
visualizations especially if you're doing a Fassett grid.

152

00:09:25.110  -->  00:09:27.270
There we go that's our plot.

153

00:09:27.300  -->  00:09:33.800
It looks much better but so far there's one thing missing and that is that these markers are very small

154

00:09:34.250  -->  00:09:36.610
that you can barely see them on this chart.

155

00:09:36.710  -->  00:09:41.830
Again if I zoom out it will look better of course and probably we don't even need it to be that group

156

157

00:09:42.680  -->  00:09:48.380
We can change the size from 10 to something lower but at the same time the markers are very small we
