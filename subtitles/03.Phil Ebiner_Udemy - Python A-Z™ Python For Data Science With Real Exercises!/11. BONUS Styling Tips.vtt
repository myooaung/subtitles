00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:10.170
Hello and welcome back to the course in Python programming in the previous tutorial we created this

2

00:00:10.230  -->  00:00:13.080
lovely dashboard that contains four charts.

3

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:15.690
Wish we had generated previously.

4

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:21.600
And as you can see it's very simple to create dashboards in Python you just use the subplots function

5

00:00:21.780  -->  00:00:26.730
to create the layout and then you populate the layout with the charts that you're after.

6

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:29.600
Now today we've got a very exciting topic ahead of us.

7

00:00:29.610  -->  00:00:33.660
We're talking about selling a dashboard and styling these charts with the dashboard.

8

00:00:33.930  -->  00:00:35.840
I'm really looking forward to it.

9

00:00:35.850  -->  00:00:37.450
Right now it really looks very good.

10

00:00:37.470  -->  00:00:43.670
But as you'll see we can make it look extremely fantastic and extremely captivating.

11

00:00:43.710  -->  00:00:50.070
And that is a very important part in our science to not only convey the findings but also to make the

12

00:00:50.070  -->  00:00:55.140
report look interesting and appealing so that people will want to read it that they will be engaged

13

00:00:55.140  -->  00:00:56.310
in reading it.

14

00:00:56.310  -->  00:00:56.580
All right.

15

00:00:56.580  -->  00:01:00.030
So let's get to it without any further ado.

16

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:06.720
So I'm going to zoom in to 200 percent and now I'm just going to basically copy everything we have.

17

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:13.050
So again I'll copy the imports because in case you're jumping into this tutorial you will need to run

18

00:01:13.050  -->  00:01:17.960
the imports if you have a jet so I'm going to first change is to mark up the line.

19

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:24.530
And here we're going to say styling dashboards and now just copy the imports.

20

00:01:24.540  -->  00:01:25.220
There we go.

21

00:01:25.230  -->  00:01:31.080
And now what you can do is just copy this whole dashboard code because we're going to be building upon

22

00:01:31.080  -->  00:01:31.830
it on top of it.

23

00:01:31.830  -->  00:01:35.090
So I'm going to run that so that the dashboard appears here again.

24

00:01:35.330  -->  00:01:36.060
Let's hear it a second.

25

00:01:36.060  -->  00:01:36.810
There it is.

26

00:01:37.080  -->  00:01:39.570
And now we're going to start styling.

27

00:01:39.570  -->  00:01:39.840
All right.

28

00:01:39.840  -->  00:01:42.250
So how can we style our dashboard.

29

00:01:42.420  -->  00:01:45.210
Well let's start with one of these plots to begin with.

30

00:01:45.210  -->  00:01:46.230
We'll start with.

31

00:01:46.530  -->  00:01:51.420
Well this one we've already started selling it actually so you can see that we've added some collars

32

00:01:51.430  -->  00:01:51.460
.

33

00:01:51.480  -->  00:01:56.550
We've got a color map see maps says for a map we've added the outline and it looks great it really looks

34

00:01:56.550  -->  00:02:04.020
good so let's do the same for these other two Cady plots and just for to make it different and to kind

35

00:02:04.020  -->  00:02:06.490
of like experiment with other types of color maps.

36

00:02:06.480  -->  00:02:11.480
We're going to use a different color map for these two plus And because also the these two plus there

37

00:02:11.510  -->  00:02:14.760
present something else this plot is audience rating versus critic rating.

38

00:02:14.940  -->  00:02:18.720
These two plots are audience which is budget and critic versus budget.

39

00:02:18.720  -->  00:02:25.980
So it will be useful for us to use a different Kalimat for these two plots so that the reader can right

40

00:02:25.980  -->  00:02:29.140
away visually assess that these two are different to that.

41

00:02:29.370  -->  00:02:31.180
All right so let's get started here.

42

00:02:31.210  -->  00:02:35.940
We're going to do something similar to the plot and the Plot Number Four So first of all I'm going to

43

00:02:36.330  -->  00:02:40.550
remove this tape comment and there's group them like this.

44

00:02:40.740  -->  00:02:43.820
So this is a plot one plot.

45

00:02:44.010  -->  00:02:45.960
All that said Plaza zero.

46

00:02:46.020  -->  00:02:47.810
This is lots.

47

00:02:47.910  -->  00:02:48.510
What is this.

48

00:02:48.510  -->  00:02:52.700
0 1 0 1 0 0.

49

00:02:52.970  -->  00:02:56.070
Just so that we know where we are while we're navigating.

50

00:02:56.070  -->  00:02:57.920
And finally what.

51

00:02:57.930  -->  00:02:58.880
One one.

52

00:02:58.890  -->  00:02:59.150
All right.

53

00:02:59.160  -->  00:03:02.760
So we're going to start with plot 0 0 the one on top left.

54

00:03:02.880  -->  00:03:08.160
And here we want to add the same kind of parameters so we can say Caccamo we really have the common

55

00:03:08.190  -->  00:03:16.500
ground sashayed equals true shaid lowest equals true and then see map.

56

00:03:16.500  -->  00:03:18.290
So here we're going to choose a different map.

57

00:03:18.300  -->  00:03:21.930
And let's start with a simple one we've already used Reds.

58

00:03:21.930  -->  00:03:24.870
Let's start with blues and see how that looks.

59

00:03:24.870  -->  00:03:29.160
So if I run that I need a comma of course and you know comma backslash.

60

00:03:29.280  -->  00:03:31.770
So for on that do it a second.

61

00:03:31.860  -->  00:03:32.160
There you go.

62

00:03:32.160  -->  00:03:36.310
So that looks quite nice already and you can also.

63

00:03:36.360  -->  00:03:41.700
Another good idea is to add an outline again because it is quite rough over here along the edges.

64

00:03:41.970  -->  00:03:45.720
Going to add an outline will say K-1 B doesn't really matter what name you give it.

65

00:03:45.720  -->  00:03:52.770
So here we don't say we don't do a shading we just add the outline like that and we'll just bring the

66

00:03:52.770  -->  00:03:55.290
axes back here so far on this.

67

00:03:55.290  -->  00:03:58.910
This will give us a nice outline and make it look contoured.

68

00:03:59.190  -->  00:04:01.650
So there you go that that looks much better radio right.

69

00:04:01.660  -->  00:04:04.790
So and then we can do the same thing for this plot over here.

70

00:04:04.800  -->  00:04:10.610
Now what I wanted to show you is that what kind of column maps exist what kind of column maps can you

71

00:04:10.610  -->  00:04:12.070
use in seaborne.

72

00:04:12.180  -->  00:04:15.270
Well for starters where did you find the columns.

73

00:04:15.510  -->  00:04:20.340
Personally I think the best way the easiest way is if you make a mistake in your code for instance you

74

00:04:20.350  -->  00:04:22.890
say blues or double s or something like that.

75

00:04:23.070  -->  00:04:30.120
If you run that then you'll bring up an error and it'll actually tell you a value error column Map blues

76

00:04:30.350  -->  00:04:32.270
is not recognize possible values are.

77

00:04:32.280  -->  00:04:37.470
And then it just lists the possible values for you right here so you can go ahead and just copy these

78

00:04:37.830  -->  00:04:44.640
into a text editor or something and you can experiment with any one any column maps from here you can

79

00:04:44.640  -->  00:04:47.310
combine them so you can use one column for the fill one.

80

00:04:47.340  -->  00:04:53.490
Another column for the contour and it can give you some great results so depending on who you're presenting

81

00:04:53.490  -->  00:04:59.880
to what kind of organization it is what's kind of reported is what the report is about you might find

82

00:04:59.880  -->  00:05:04.290
different column maps are more suitable to different situations.

83

00:05:04.290  -->  00:05:08.910
So in this case I'm just going to use something that I've found that looks really appealing for our

84

00:05:08.910  -->  00:05:09.960
situation.

85

00:05:09.960  -->  00:05:16.200
And then you should feel free to experiment and try out different ones so the color I'm going to use

86

00:05:16.200  -->  00:05:23.750
for the fill is Inferno and the outline is going to be very contrasting is going to be cool.

87

00:05:23.820  -->  00:05:27.710
So you can see them here if you scroll down you'll find cool is here.

88

00:05:28.260  -->  00:05:33.360
And in fairness here as well and also when you say if you want to reverse the column up you just under

89

00:05:33.400  -->  00:05:33.530
.

90

00:05:33.540  -->  00:05:39.030
You put an underscore and then an R and that will reverse the order in which the colors come.

91

00:05:39.030  -->  00:05:43.390
So if I run this now you'll see what it looks like.

92

00:05:43.410  -->  00:05:46.740
So there you can see that we've got the inferno color scheme.

93

00:05:46.950  -->  00:05:51.930
So it goes from yellow and then so like very hot in the middle and then dies off.

94

00:05:51.930  -->  00:05:58.560
And then we've got the contrasting cool outline and makes it look like neon ish type of mix a non-issue

95

00:05:58.560  -->  00:05:59.050
chart.

96

00:05:59.070  -->  00:06:05.430
And it also draws a lot of attention to it so in the middle you can really see the outline you can.

97

00:06:05.430  -->  00:06:08.060
But at the same time it kind of matches the feel.

98

00:06:08.070  -->  00:06:13.230
But then towards the edges the outline is very contouring and gives this kind of futuristic look and

99

00:06:13.260  -->  00:06:19.800
I personally really like this type of charge and it works well in our dashboard as you'll see as we

100

00:06:19.800  -->  00:06:21.390
style the rest of the charts.

101

00:06:21.450  -->  00:06:23.350
It will be a good fit.

102

00:06:23.370  -->  00:06:26.910
All right so that's our first chart second chart as we discussed.

103

00:06:26.900  -->  00:06:33.720
We're going to keep it in the same styling because we want our users to visually understand right away

104

00:06:33.720  -->  00:06:37.210
that these charts are related that they're talking about the same thing.

105

00:06:37.230  -->  00:06:44.220
So it's easy for them to understand that without having to look at the axes or try and read the chart

106

00:06:44.430  -->  00:06:49.110
in advance so it's basically right away an obvious thing.

107

00:06:49.110  -->  00:06:54.480
So here we're going to do a similar thing going to copy that and we're going to replace that here and

108

00:06:54.480  -->  00:06:56.220
we'll just say 0 1.

109

00:06:56.250  -->  00:06:58.580
So there you go that's how critic training.

110

00:06:58.620  -->  00:06:59.700
Have a look at that.

111

00:06:59.750  -->  00:07:02.450
Of course somewhere I forgot something.

112

00:07:02.670  -->  00:07:03.300
Let's have a look.

113

00:07:03.300  -->  00:07:05.090
What did I forget.

114

00:07:05.100  -->  00:07:08.720
All right so let's change this to be here and let's try that again.

115

00:07:08.970  -->  00:07:14.460
There's just some spaces after the line continuation character or some tabs so just make sure that doesn't

116

00:07:14.460  -->  00:07:15.380
happen.

117

00:07:15.450  -->  00:07:20.100
Otherwise just kind of what you can do is always just delete and then press enter.

118

00:07:20.100  -->  00:07:21.270
That will fix it.

119

00:07:21.270  -->  00:07:22.590
All right so there we go.

120

00:07:22.590  -->  00:07:27.340
Now you can see that these two charts look very very slick.

121

00:07:27.340  -->  00:07:30.150
They look I think they look fantastic personally.

122

00:07:30.300  -->  00:07:33.430
Now we've got to work on these remaining charts so what are we going to do here.

123

00:07:33.750  -->  00:07:41.250
Well for these charts one thing that we can add or we can change is definitely the background.

124

00:07:41.250  -->  00:07:48.240
So as you see the background here is black and that is an effect that black is part of the color scheme

125

00:07:48.240  -->  00:07:50.520
for inferno so it's the last color.

126

00:07:50.580  -->  00:07:52.800
And here we were saying shade low is true.

127

00:07:52.790  -->  00:07:57.510
So if we don't say Shiloh's true then the black won't be here and will be just the same background as

128

00:07:57.510  -->  00:07:58.230
these two.

129

00:07:58.350  -->  00:08:03.300
But it actually looks pretty good so let's try get these background black as well.

130

00:08:03.300  -->  00:08:04.560
How do we do that.

131

00:08:04.560  -->  00:08:07.440
Well we need to look at our set style which is at the top.

132

00:08:07.440  -->  00:08:08.670
We've got dark grid.

133

00:08:08.890  -->  00:08:14.100
But how do we make it black because we know that the only options available here there are not many

134

00:08:14.100  -->  00:08:19.680
options or actually just white white grid dark and dark green.

135

00:08:19.680  -->  00:08:22.140
These are preset styles and ticks.

136

00:08:22.140  -->  00:08:24.590
So how do we actually make it just black.

137

00:08:24.780  -->  00:08:28.670
Well we can pass a keyword parameter or keyword argument.

138

00:08:28.680  -->  00:08:30.900
So we're going to create a dictionary here.

139

00:08:30.930  -->  00:08:35.890
And the keyword argument that we're after is called axes don't face color.

140

00:08:36.240  -->  00:08:37.980
American spelling of color.

141

00:08:37.980  -->  00:08:43.230
And then we'll say here we'll say black is kind of the background of your chart and that's that's a

142

00:08:43.230  -->  00:08:50.340
way to circumvent the predefined style so the start grid is not just black it's got it's got a blue

143

00:08:50.340  -->  00:08:51.580
kind of bluish background.

144

00:08:51.690  -->  00:08:54.330
Here is saying we want the background to be black.

145

00:08:54.360  -->  00:08:56.010
Let's have a look.

146

00:08:56.010  -->  00:08:59.670
There you go so now it's black but it still has this grid.

147

00:08:59.670  -->  00:09:03.320
So what we want to do is we want to change it from dark grid to dark.

148

00:09:03.420  -->  00:09:05.500
Or you can just put in white doesn't matter.

149

00:09:05.610  -->  00:09:06.450
The result will be the same.

150

00:09:06.450  -->  00:09:14.010
So basically the style say we want just a bluish background like we had previously and these plots were

151

00:09:14.010  -->  00:09:16.090
a grayish background without a grid.

152

00:09:16.140  -->  00:09:21.210
And then this keyword argument is going to override the gray Scala with black.

153

00:09:21.210  -->  00:09:23.330
So let's have a look at that.

154

00:09:24.120  -->  00:09:28.360
All right so now you can see there's no grid and these charts are assigned to look great.

155

00:09:28.650  -->  00:09:30.690
What else would we change about these charts.

156

00:09:30.690  -->  00:09:35.820
Well the first thing that you can see is that this chart now doesn't look as good on the black background

157

00:09:35.820  -->  00:09:37.790
because the white light.

158

00:09:37.800  -->  00:09:41.250
It's dark in the middle then it goes out to white and it really contrasts the black.

159

00:09:41.370  -->  00:09:46.950
So it just looks like it was like it all to me looks like a blurb there was just dropped onto this black

160

00:09:46.950  -->  00:09:50.250
background doesn't look as great as it used to.

161

00:09:50.250  -->  00:09:51.520
So how can we fix that up.

162

00:09:51.720  -->  00:09:55.700
Well one of the ways we can fix it up is to change the color and also might be a good idea to change

163

00:09:55.700  -->  00:10:00.860
the color to make it even more so different to these charts.

164

00:10:00.960  -->  00:10:08.250
So let's try something else a color scheme that I found for this Plaut years.

165

00:10:08.250  -->  00:10:09.390
Let's go up here.

166

00:10:09.900  -->  00:10:17.760
And here we're going to just say for this plot what I found works pretty well surprisingly well because

167

00:10:17.760  -->  00:10:20.670
it is different to the other parts will say blues here.

168

00:10:21.200  -->  00:10:29.420
And for the Cantore and Reds we're going to say just underscore gray underscore r.

169

00:10:29.620  -->  00:10:33.050
So that's the reversed just in grey color scheme.

170

00:10:33.350  -->  00:10:35.230
Let's have a look at that.

171

00:10:35.240  -->  00:10:35.900
So there you go.

172

00:10:35.890  -->  00:10:38.770
Now you can see that this looks pretty neat.

173

00:10:38.810  -->  00:10:45.220
So the reverse Gray is actually works very well so you can see the white is on the outline instead of

174

00:10:45.230  -->  00:10:46.770
being on the inside.

175

00:10:46.790  -->  00:10:49.160
And therefore it would blend in with the filling.

176

00:10:49.160  -->  00:10:55.550
Now we've reversed it and the gray or the contour is very contrasting to the feel and then it still

177

00:10:55.550  -->  00:10:58.570
stays contrasting as you go out towards the edges.

178

00:10:58.610  -->  00:11:03.410
And personally I find that this chart looks quite mesmerizing it looks like it's actually three dimensional

179

00:11:03.410  -->  00:11:06.190
when you look at the waves over here.

180

00:11:06.230  -->  00:11:10.150
So that is our fourth chart how we stand that.

181

00:11:10.160  -->  00:11:17.240
And as you can see the style of the violin plots isn't really changing because we haven't changed color

182

00:11:17.240  -->  00:11:22.500
scheme here so let's get to our violin plus and change them up a little bit.

183

00:11:22.550  -->  00:11:28.600
So by the way this these are violent parts for just critic creating it is kind of a bit unfair towards

184

00:11:28.630  -->  00:11:33.110
the audience rating so we've got audience rating here and we've got budget millions here so maybe you

185

00:11:33.110  -->  00:11:35.920
will want to change these as well to something else.

186

00:11:35.930  -->  00:11:41.900
For instance we could do a violent plot of budget million so maybe it is go ahead and do that will change

187

00:11:41.890  -->  00:11:42.680
it over here.

188

00:11:42.770  -->  00:11:51.020
So say whereas our will and plot there is one plot so we don't want just drama for movies shows the

189

00:11:51.020  -->  00:11:57.050
drama daughter said we want daughter movies and X equals what do we want X to be.

190

00:11:57.050  -->  00:12:04.010
I think we want X to be we could do a genre or we could year so if we have here and sort of critic creating

191

00:12:04.000  -->  00:12:06.700
we say Budget millions.

192

00:12:06.770  -->  00:12:08.230
So let's keep it a year for now.

193

00:12:08.230  -->  00:12:09.470
So if I run this.

194

00:12:09.880  -->  00:12:14.650
That's our original wild plot in the on edited charts there.

195

00:12:14.690  -->  00:12:15.830
That's what it looks like.

196

00:12:16.060  -->  00:12:19.850
And now in the style chart we're going to replace it here as well.

197

00:12:20.060  -->  00:12:26.140
And while we're at it how do we add some color to our well and plus how do we specify the color scheme

198

00:12:26.140  -->  00:12:27.550
that we want to use for the well and plus.

199

00:12:27.560  -->  00:12:30.240
So let's see how to do how we can do that.

200

00:12:30.570  -->  00:12:34.650
Well the violent plots the parameter that we want to use is.

201

00:12:35.060  -->  00:12:36.370
Let's go back here.

202

00:12:36.590  -->  00:12:41.750
The prompter we want to use is called palette palette equals.

203

00:12:41.870  -->  00:12:46.520
And here we want to say we want to choose a palette once again it's the same as a comma.

204

00:12:46.540  -->  00:12:49.280
You could use Inferno you could just cool.

205

00:12:49.390  -->  00:12:50.420
For example let's try.

206

00:12:50.440  -->  00:12:52.430
Cool let's see what that looks like.

207

00:12:52.460  -->  00:12:53.850
So he's cool.

208

00:12:53.850  -->  00:12:55.640
Give it a second to load.

209

00:12:55.630  -->  00:12:57.870
All right so here you can see cool.

210

00:12:57.880  -->  00:12:59.240
Personally I don't think that's the best one.

211

00:12:59.240  -->  00:13:02.930
It doesn't look the best towards the purplish colors.

212

00:13:03.080  -->  00:13:10.310
So towards the higher frequencies we wanted to like it starts to hurt your eyes or blend in with the

213

00:13:10.310  -->  00:13:11.510
black somehow.

214

00:13:11.500  -->  00:13:18.950
So we want to change a color and a good one I found in this case is yellow so y l or R for Orange and

215

00:13:19.070  -->  00:13:21.530
R.G. for red yellow orange red.

216

00:13:21.530  -->  00:13:26.050
So I give that a go and see what our result looks like.

217

00:13:26.060  -->  00:13:29.050
There we go so I find this one looks pretty interesting.

218

00:13:29.060  -->  00:13:34.580
So you can see that how the budget in millions has been changing throughout the years hasn't been changing

219

00:13:34.580  -->  00:13:35.880
that much so.

220

00:13:35.990  -->  00:13:40.640
But at the same time you can see that the width has been changing so that's showing you where the concentration

221

00:13:40.700  -->  00:13:47.780
of the different movies is where the different points are so you can always change it to.

222

00:13:47.890  -->  00:13:51.670
Very quickly you can change it to genre for instance and have a look at that as well.

223

00:13:51.680  -->  00:13:56.270
So it depends on what insights you want to convey what charge you want to include in your final result

224

00:13:56.280  -->  00:13:56.510
.

225

00:13:56.750  -->  00:14:01.610
So genre in this case it doesn't look as neat because there isn't that much space but at the same time

226

00:14:01.610  -->  00:14:07.460
you can see how the violin plots change so for action adventure comedy thrill and so on.

227

00:14:07.610  -->  00:14:15.460
So I'm going to keep it at year so we don't make too many changes to the original chart or original

228

00:14:15.680  -->  00:14:16.710
dashboard.

229

00:14:16.940  -->  00:14:17.810
And let's have a look at that.

230

00:14:17.810  -->  00:14:22.540
So this is our final zoom out.

231

00:14:22.580  -->  00:14:23.030
There you go.

232

00:14:23.030  -->  00:14:29.440
So you can see it is a lovely dashboard even though this one is already very interesting very cool.

233

00:14:29.440  -->  00:14:32.560
A bit of styling makes such a huge difference right.

234

00:14:32.570  -->  00:14:40.130
So when you compare this one which looks kind of like Accademia type of focused and it is something

235

00:14:40.120  -->  00:14:41.090
that you put in Room.

236

00:14:41.090  -->  00:14:45.860
Reporter even a published paper looks OK it looks it looks good it conveys the insight.

237

00:14:45.860  -->  00:14:48.320
Whereas this this really stands out.

238

00:14:48.320  -->  00:14:53.270
This is something you put in a presentation for a big conference when you're presenting to a couple

239

00:14:53.270  -->  00:14:58.250
of hundred people or maybe a thousand people you present your present something like this because this

240

00:14:58.250  -->  00:14:58.880
is fun.

241

00:14:58.880  -->  00:15:05.500
This looks amazing it wants people to learn more about what you're trying to tell them and they'll be

242

00:15:05.540  -->  00:15:08.420
curious about these charges because they actually stand out.

243

00:15:08.490  -->  00:15:14.090
And that's a very important part of data science to make your presentation so captivating that the audience

244

00:15:14.100  -->  00:15:17.600
wants to learn more about what you're about to tell them.

245

00:15:17.650  -->  00:15:19.150
So hope you enjoy this tutorial.

246

00:15:19.150  -->  00:15:21.350
Definitely have a play around with that.

247

00:15:21.350  -->  00:15:27.170
There are endless possibilities for you to combine different color schemes and different dashboards

248

00:15:27.160  -->  00:15:28.950
layouts different charts.

249

00:15:28.970  -->  00:15:33.920
It's always good to practice these things because not only will you have fun along the way but also

250

00:15:33.910  -->  00:15:38.220
you will get that hands on experience and I hope you enjoyed the story.

251

00:15:38.410  -->  00:15:39.680
I look forward to seeing you next time.

252

00:15:39.710  -->  00:15:44.730
Until then happy coding.
