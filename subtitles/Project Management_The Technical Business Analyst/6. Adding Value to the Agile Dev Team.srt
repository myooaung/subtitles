1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:05,525
Unquestionably, technical BAs add value to the agile dev team.

2
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:09,505
Position the technical BA as close to the end product as possible.

3
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:11,492
You would like a BA to be responsible for delivering a

4
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:14,436
working product and that they directly work on validation

5
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,565
and implementation of the product.

6
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,875
Since the technical BA is deeply involved with the product owner

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,040
or customers and developing the user stories,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,741
it enables the dev team to quickly get answers or details without

9
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,545
having to circle back to the product owner.

10
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:27,880
Plus,

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,852
the team can adjust rapidly if some ideas do not work since the

12
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:34,545
technical BA is embedded in the dev team.

13
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:37,565
This saves time, not just the dev team's time,

14
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:40,545
but the very busy product owner's time as well.

15
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:40,769
Therefore,

16
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:44,279
you would like to have a technical BA as one of the development team

17
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,555
members just like a developer or quality analysts are too.

18
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:47,841
Now,

19
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:51,565
the technical BA can use his or her expertise and domain knowledge

20
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:54,565
to optimize the product development process,

21
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,565
keeping focused on the end result.

22
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,555
The techies on the team are great, of course.

23
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,076
But I have seen where they can get carried away with the

24
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:04,555
technology and may lose sight of the end result.

25
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:08,505
The technical BA is there to provide the continued focus.

26
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:13,353
Lastly, the technical BA adds an organizational or political overlay on the team,

27
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,305
which can be beneficial on how best to handle troubling

28
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:19,525
team or departmental productivity issues.

29
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,809
So if you want to optimize for speed, agility,

30
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:22,398
and learning,

31
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:28,585
it is probably better to have a technical BA be part of your agile team.

32
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:31,555
Here are a few more examples of how technical BAs

33
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,585
add value to the development team.

34
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:37,346
Remember the technical BA's skill areas from the previous module?

35
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,535
Well, they all apply here.

36
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:42,595
User interface and user experience, prototyping,

37
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:46,915
data modeling, business data analytics, interface analysis,

38
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:51,595
quality assurance and testing, off-the-shelf solutions and building blocks.

39
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:52,164
Lastly,

40
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:58,567
the technical BA focuses on ensuring that real business value is identified

41
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,585
and revealed by working closely with the product owner.

42
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:05,024
And then, helping to convey the requirements,

43
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:10,411
priorities, and business value to the agile team to make their work easier,

44
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:13,555
more productive, and more enjoyable.

45
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,902
As a technical BA,

46
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,698
be aware of your organizational surroundings and what

47
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:21,515
I'm calling organizational awareness.

48
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,535
Typically, management is matrixed.

49
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:27,712
That is where the members of the agile/Scrum team is a collection of people,

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,535
generally self-directed, but still report to managers.

51
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:34,038
In fact, everyone on the team may report to different managers,

52
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:37,188
therefore their points of view of agile,

53
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:41,515
Scrum, and technology may flow from different organizational biases.

54
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:44,179
Each of their managers will have different viewpoints about agile,

55
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,595
some good, and maybe some not so good.

56
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,505
These managers at times may push for their own deadlines,

57
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,585
which would usurp the agile process flows.

58
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:53,657
By the way,

59
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,975
this includes the manager of the product owner who might

60
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,585
apply the greatest pressure on the team.

61
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:01,555
Be prepared to deal with those challenges.

62
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,515
Lastly, executives and senior leaders,

63
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:07,326
they are the most removed from the action and will be

64
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:09,189
more inclined to see schedules, milestones,

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,565
and the supporting financials.

66
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,359
This is where you come in.

67
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,555
As the technical BA,

68
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:17,718
you not only have the knowledge and appreciation of the project itself,

69
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:21,996
but will be the best candidate to relate and report this type of

70
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:24,525
information to the executives and managers.

71
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:27,585
Consider partnering up with the product owner as well,

72
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:30,555
since they will have a direct connection to the business.

73
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:31,421
And, of course,

74
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:35,233
partner with the management of the agile IT team members to educate

75
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,545
them that there is more to life than just agile.

76
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:42,063
Hence, be aware of the organizational issues,

77
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,846
personalities, politics, broader budgets,

78
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:47,411
and things like that, since it may be you,

79
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,525
the technical BA,

80
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,709
who's the most qualified to bridge the gap between the business

81
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,565
and possibly a new way of developing software,

82
00:03:54,565 --> 00:04:02,000
which may be quite different from the traditional way senior leaders are used to doing business.
