Hello.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,060
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,193
I will be presenting Tools of the Trade in the course,

4
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:10,010
The Technical Business Analyst.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,060
Here's a great quote.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,020
"A good tool improves the way you work.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,722
A great tool improves the way you think.

8
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:19,000
" I really like this quote.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,159
I think analysis tools should improve the way you work,

10
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:24,030
but more importantly the way you think.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,010
Just the act and process of using a tool can elicit so many new questions,

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,080
leading to new insights, or lead to even cooler ideas and innovations.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,020
Now when I use the word tool, it is more than just a hammer.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,000
A tool can be a process, a methodology or a way in which to go about your work,

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,020
or maybe a combination of all those.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,010
So please keep that in mind in this module.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,050
Eighty-nine percent of analysts use visual diagramming techniques,

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,040
and I bet this percent is growing.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,070
I strongly recommend that for any tools you use,

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,413
either automated or manual, reports, spreadsheets or whatever,

21
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:03,060
you be as visual as possible.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,899
Visual depictions greatly enhance understanding and comprehension

23
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,912
and the ability to communicate with your business and technical

24
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:13,050
teams more rapidly and with greater quality.

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,689
If you have the opportunity to actually pick the tools you can use,

26
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,000
please keep in mind,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,693
those with visual interfaces or expressions of information will

28
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:26,070
likely be the most productive and revealing.

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,040
Here's the overview of this module.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,010
First, we will start with a technical BA's skill areas.

31
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,010
We touched on these in the module The Technical Business Analyst,

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,040
and in this module, I'll be going into more detail with each one.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,220
I made the point as well in that module that knowledge and skills

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,293
in these areas will also greatly help you bridge the gap between

35
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,050
the business and the technical teams.

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,030
Most of this module will be covering those tools.

37
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,000
At the end of the module, I will cover the technical BA's basic tools.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We don't want to lose sight of the basic tools all analysts use every day, technical or otherwise.
