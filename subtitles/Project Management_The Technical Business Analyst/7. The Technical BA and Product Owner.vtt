00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:04.193
There is a lot of opportunity in key contributions for a

2
00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:07.534
technical BA regarding the product owner.

3
00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:10.024
Let's check that out.

4
00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:12.994
So why does the product owner need your help?

5
00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:16.024
Well, every product owner is different and unique.

6
00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:19.778
Product owners are very busy and are focused on the business and may

7
00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:23.034
not be available or able to allocate enough time.

8
00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:27.024
Not all product owners have the skills to fill the role of the product owner,

9
00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:31.084
and you must coach and guide the product owner to fulfill his or her role.

10
00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:35.402
In one case I observed the IT organization paired up a

11
00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.044
technical business analyst with each product owner.

12
00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:42.024
This was immensely successful in providing high-quality requirements,

13
00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:44.084
backlog development, and prioritization.

14
00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:48.067
Product owners may be unfamiliar with writing epics and user stories,

15
00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:50.409
and quite frankly may be unfamiliar because,

16
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.084
well, they're running a business.

17
00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:52.582
Again,

18
00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:58.004
the technical BA is effectively contributing and bridging the gap

19
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.064
between the business and the agile dev team.

20
00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:04.039
I strongly encourage you to take every opportunity to work

21
00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.054
very closely with your product owner.

22
00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:10.034
Here are two options I would like you to consider.

23
00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:12.074
You could be the proxy to the product owner.

24
00:01:12.074 --> 00:01:16.331
A proxy is someone who has the authority to represent someone else,

25
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.074
such as a representative, substitute or delegate.

26
00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:22.044
The other option is to partner with the product owner.

27
00:01:22.044 --> 00:01:26.044
Okay, now let's examine each one.

28
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:31.044
Let's talk about you, the technical BA, being the proxy of a product owner.

29
00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:35.098
The product owner proxy role is appropriate for the technical BA.

30
00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:36.994
I have seen it work in action,

31
00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:40.529
provided the proxy is empowered and supported to act

32
00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.044
on behalf of the product owner.

33
00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:44.084
This is very important.

34
00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:44.478
Now,

35
00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:48.622
how they are empowered and delegated authority to act in behalf

36
00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:51.014
of the product owner is important as well.

37
00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:54.994
Hence, clearly and succinctly delegate authority.

38
00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:57.911
The product owner must communicate in writing or verbally,

39
00:01:57.911 --> 00:02:00.054
or in a presentation format.

40
00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:00.446
Also,

41
00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:04.890
the product owner attends the agile project kickoff meeting to ensure all

42
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.587
parties understand the role and authority of the technical business

43
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:11.074
analyst and answer and address any questions.

44
00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:16.024
This shows that the product owner's authority is being given to you.

45
00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:19.994
Now, product owners are very busy and are focused on the business,

46
00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.994
and may not be available to play the role of product owner.

47
00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:26.074
And what if the product owner had two or three projects running concurrently?

48
00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:28.994
There's just not enough time in the day.

49
00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:35.054
So having a proxy role may be a very viable option for the technical BA.

50
00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.064
The other option is where you partner with the product owner.

51
00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.421
The product owner fulfills the product owner role completely,

52
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:46.141
and the technical BA as his or her partner will provide support,

53
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:48.054
such as technical analysis support.

54
00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:48.391
Also,

55
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:52.407
the technical business analyst works with the product owner and other key

56
00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:56.044
business experts to clarify requirements and user stories.

57
00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:58.577
Executives and senior managers will typically describe

58
00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:01.160
requirements in large and fuzzy epics,

59
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.148
and hence performing more analysis to provide more granular epics

60
00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:09.044
and user stories is essential to perform analysis to validate

61
00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:12.004
priorities as set by the product owner.

62
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:15.866
And lastly, represent the product owner in the agile project,

63
00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.084
release, and sprint planning activities.

64
00:03:18.084 --> 00:03:22.846
But this should be limited and rare since you are not a proxy,

65
00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:27.484
but instead filling in at times for the product owner if necessary if

66
00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:31.084
there are scheduling conflicts and things like that.

67
00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:34.771
In either the proxy or partner role there are

68
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:37.044
similarities to your technical BA activities.

69
00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:41.994
I may have already touched on a few, but I want to emphasize them here again.

70
00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:46.034
Not all product owners have the skills to do analysis or to write user stories,

71
00:03:46.034 --> 00:03:50.034
and so you must coach and guide the product owner to fulfill his or her role.

72
00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:51.519
I tried this approach,

73
00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.598
this was immensely successful in providing

74
00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:55.084
high-quality requirements to the backlog.

75
00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:59.034
Deliver core analysis artifacts, such as process,

76
00:03:59.034 --> 00:04:02.044
impact, stakeholder, and enterprise analyses.

77
00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:02.345
Now,

78
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.054
while the product owner is focused on their customer

79
00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:09.544
and the new product requirements, you can be focused on process diagrams,

80
00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:12.256
identifying missing stakeholders, managing scope,

81
00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:16.074
identifying backlog items, and anything else that may have been overlooked.

82
00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.074
Product owner availability.

83
00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.842
The product owner should be focused on funding,

84
00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:25.014
working with customers, meeting with senior leadership as they should be.

85
00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:29.402
So your role then is to be available to the agile dev team and to be

86
00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.483
fully competent in the product owner's vision,

87
00:04:31.483 --> 00:04:35.014
product backlog, and business intentions of the user stories.

88
00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:40.221
Once again, your role is to be fully competent in the product owner's vision,

89
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:44.074
product backlog, and business intentions of the user stories.

90
00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:48.084
The analyst can actively help manage the product backlog with the agile team.

91
00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:52.024
Identify and validate product priorities with the agile team.

92
00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:55.084
Identify and refine epics and user stories with the agile team.

93
00:04:55.084 --> 00:04:58.044
Build on relationships with business stakeholders,

94
00:04:58.044 --> 00:05:01.074
customers or end users of the ultimate solution.

95
00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:01.870
And lastly,

96
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.900
help bridge the gap between the product backlog and the

97
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.014
technical realities of the project.

98
00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:11.405
I have seen that the dev team is quite technology-focused and

99
00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:15.245
may not always have the bandwidth to spend that extra time

100
00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:18.024
with the product owner as you can.

101
00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:19.554
As I hope you can see,

102
00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:22.081
the technical BA can actively manage and support the

103
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:24.074
delivery of value to the project.

104
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.084
But of the two options I have presented,

105
00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:29.903
I do like the partner approach a little better and I

106
00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:32.024
think it typically works best.

107
00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:39.000
Either one will work with the right people, the right attitudes, and with the right communication.
