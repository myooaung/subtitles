1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:04,613
Let's drill into more detail on what a business analyst does for a living.

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:08,716
The analyst interacts with the business stakeholders and the subject matter

3
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:12,553
experts in order to understand their problems and needs.

4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,603
The analyst gathers documents and analyzes business needs and requirements.

5
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:22,538
The analyst solves business problems, that is lays out the approaches,

6
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:27,533
methods, processes, and tools that should get the job done,

7
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,613
and, as needed, literally designs the solutions,

8
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,593
but that's not all.

9
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:34,613
And there is more.

10
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:37,605
Once the requirements have been discovered and gathered,

11
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,553
your job has only just begun.

12
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:44,563
You must also analyze requirements, document requirements,

13
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:47,767
validate requirements, prioritize requirements,

14
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:53,563
communicate those requirements, communicate with IT professionals in particular,

15
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:56,933
change management, and work within waterfall or agile methodologies,

16
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,573
and that just scratches the surface.

17
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:03,583
There is certainly a lot more.

18
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:07,623
There are many designations, titles or monikers of an analyst.

19
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,563
Let's discuss a few.

20
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:10,558
Business analyst.

21
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:15,573
This is the typical, generic designation of pretty much all analysts.

22
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:16,427
Business Architect.

23
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:19,566
They perform activities such as strategic alignment,

24
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:24,543
creating business operating models, and determining a strategic business vision,

25
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,533
as examples.

26
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:30,226
Business process analysts may perform activities such as developing and

27
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:34,563
modeling business processes with workflow and process engines to document

28
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:37,593
and compare as is and to the process models.

29
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,088
Business systems analysts.

30
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:44,533
Well, they take requirements as inputs, create functional specifications,

31
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,593
specify how a system will do the what,

32
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:49,553
and interface directly with the developers.

33
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:52,603
They also write the tactical requirements from the business requirements.

34
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:57,533
Sometimes a business systems analyst is shortened just a systems analyst title.

35
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:58,149
Data analyst.

36
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,988
The data analyst is the professional who's focused on

37
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,613
analysis and problem solving related to data,

38
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,102
types of data,

39
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:10,533
and relationships among data elements within a business system or IT system.

40
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,608
They perform logical data modeling, identify patterns in data,

41
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:17,696
design how to translate and transfer data into other

42
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,553
data stores such as data warehouses,

43
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:25,108
and also design and create reports or visualizations to enable users to

44
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:28,613
easily consume and make quality business decisions.

45
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:32,417
Now, there are a lot of other common titles for these roles,

46
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:35,623
and they may be requirements engineer, requirements analyst,

47
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,563
application consultant, and application analyst.

48
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:40,593
As you can see,

49
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:44,177
every organization may have slightly different titles

50
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:47,583
with different job descriptions.

51
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,593
So, who is doing business analysis?

52
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:52,563
Well, just about everyone.

53
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,889
The job of doing business analysis is performed by people in

54
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,590
organizations that may range in job title from product owner,

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,746
developer, project manager or project leader,

56
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:05,553
product manager, subject matter experts,

57
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,623
and certainly many more.

58
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:11,068
So we can see that there are lots of roles doing analysis,

59
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:15,533
even though their titles do not end with the word analyst.

60
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:21,000
And, there are many true analyst roles as well as we discussed on the previous slide.
