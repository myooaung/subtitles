My final words.

00:00:03.117 --> 00:00:07.177
The bottom line is your ability to deliver business value.

00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:14.137
It is your biggest asset as a technical business analyst.

and at the same time participate in helping shape the

11

technology solutions to meet those goals.

12
00:00:37.147 --> 00:00:40.459
Every company is different in just how the gap is straddled and

13
00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:43.177
by whom is best suited to bridge the gap.

14
00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:47.127

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.804
have been challenged over the years in how to best bridge the

19
00:00:57.804 --> 00:01:00.117

and renewed confidence to help you be more successful

24
00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:11.117
