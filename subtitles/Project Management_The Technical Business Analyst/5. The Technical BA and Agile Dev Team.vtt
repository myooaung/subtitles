00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:03.415
Now let's look at how the technical BA would work

2
00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:06.272
with the agile development team.

3
00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:10.292
Let's discuss the options the technical BA has with the agile dev team.

4
00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:14.212
At the bottom of the slide we have the members of a typical dev team.

5
00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:16.282
Certainly they might be a bit different in your environment.

6
00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.232
In this case, the technical BA is a member of the dev team,

7
00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:24.274
just like the other members, and participates in all aspects of project,

8
00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.222
release, and sprint planning and execution.

9
00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:29.262
In some organizations where resources, budgets,

10
00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.531
or skills may be tight,

11
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:34.262
the technical BA may not only play the role of an analyst on the team,

12
00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:37.252
but also the Scrum Master role at the same time.

13
00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:40.282
I think since a technical BA is not developing software,

14
00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:43.369
then they can be more objective in ensuring the

15
00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.282
agile/Scrum processes are being followed.

16
00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:49.848
Now, without a PM schedules and budgets are usually pushed aside,

17
00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:52.456
forgotten, or the dev team says we are agile,

18
00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:53.282
who needs them?

19
00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:54.589
This is not wise.

20
00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.988
I don't like that approach and management generally needs a steady

21
00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:02.049
flow of more traditional project information and artifacts to make

22
00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.292
business decisions such as funding, scheduling,

23
00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:08.242
and resources throughout a company, and not only in IT.

24
00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.796
Again, in some organizations where resources,

25
00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.329
budgets or skills may be tight or limited,

26
00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.282
the technical BA may not only play the role of an analyst on the team,

27
00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:19.282
but also the project management role at the same time.

28
00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:19.566
Yes,

29
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.374
I know that the project manager is not an official

30
00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.302
part of the agile and Scrum team,

31
00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:28.074
but I have seen this role in more cases than not and I do

32
00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:30.292
recommend it and like it on larger projects.

33
00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:34.272
To wrap up, with the right skills, you, the technical BA,

34
00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:37.252
could do all three of these roles concurrently.

35
00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:39.272
In addition to your technical BA skills,

36
00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:42.649
you could also get certified as a Scrum Master and

37
00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.212
get your PNP certification as well.

38
00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:47.302
What a killer combination of skills you would have.

39
00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:49.302
I would hire you in a heartbeat.

40
00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:52.212
Also, people are not built from cookie cutters,

41
00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.525
but have a composite set of skills and capabilities; hence,

42
00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.903
every agile/Scrum team may be composed slightly

43
00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:02.252
differently based on the talent at hand.

44
00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:05.292
Positioning the technical BA role in agile teams.

45
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.074
As a matter of team design,

46
00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:10.369
a technical BA role should be considered for every team based

47
00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.625
on the nature of the makeup of the team,

48
00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:16.222
the user stories, and your resources which may be limited.

49
00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:20.242
Sharing a technical BA across multiple teams is an option certainly,

50
00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:25.252
just like a DBA or a quality assurance analyst role may not be full-time either.

51
00:02:25.252 --> 00:02:27.292
The technical BA could be a part-time member.

52
00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:31.486
In the perfect world the dev team is one single group of people

53
00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:34.428
performing multiple sprints and getting more efficient,

54
00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:38.212
that is improving their velocity with every sprint.

55
00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:42.232
I want to emphasize consistent, yet could also be part-time.

56
00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:45.222
But that is not how it usually is in the real world.

57
00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:48.292
Resources vary and business analyst skills vary as well.

58
00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:54.302
Therefore, be flexible in how you allocate your resources for your agile team.

59
00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:58.252
Here are two key areas a technical BA should focus on.

60
00:02:58.252 --> 00:03:00.272
The first is a business focus.

61
00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:04.572
Working with the product owners and customer representatives by asking probing,

62
00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:07.232
what if, what about type questions.

63
00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:10.295
The best analysts are involved in every aspect of story identification.

64
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.302
This is a very key skill,

65
00:03:12.302 --> 00:03:17.262
listening intently to discern if and when a requirement is expressed.

66
00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:20.699
The technical BA will have an understanding of the various ways the

67
00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.292
broad community of users will need to use the system,

68
00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:26.732
understanding the divergent needs and smoothing the

69
00:03:26.732 --> 00:03:29.232
differences to identify the design aspects,

70
00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.292
which will work for the disparate stakeholders.

71
00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:35.222
The analysts will marshal and guide epics and user stories,

72
00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:37.792
steering the discovery process and facilitating the

73
00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:40.242
communication among the development team.

74
00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:43.222
The second key area is interpersonal focus.

75
00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:46.232
What I mean by this focus area is the relationships

76
00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:48.232
and communication between people.

77
00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:50.272
Nurturing stakeholder relationships.

78
00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:54.027
Building a deeper understanding and appreciation of the stakeholders,

79
00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:56.302
communities, business, drivers, and issues.

80
00:03:56.302 --> 00:04:00.732
Gaining insight into the political aspects of the project

81
00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:03.712
and influence relationships which underlie the formal

82
00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:05.212
structure of the organization.

83
00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:05.472
Lastly,

84
00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:07.651
these activities I have just mentioned above are

85
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:11.242
well suited for the technical BA, or certainly should be.

86
00:04:11.242 --> 00:04:14.372
Not all members of the dev team are interested in these activities,

87
00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:16.222
nor want to do them.

88
00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:25.000
Technical BAs being business analysts at heart have a greater affinity for these more personal and soft skill activities.
