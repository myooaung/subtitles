00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:01.409
In this section,

2
00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:05.203
we will discuss off-the-shelf solutions to meet and address your

3
00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:10.869
requirements as an alternative to a custom-built solution.

4
00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:11.959
Should I even have to say this?

5
00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.621
Clearly understand your business needs and make sure the off-the-shelf

6
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.959
solution is the right fit for your organization.

7
00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:22.949
Now, this applies to not only the off-the-shelf option,

8
00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.959
but custom software as well.

9
00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.949
The difference is that with custom software,

10
00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.623
you can continue to tweak or refine to continually meet and

11
00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:35.316
address your requirements if you didn't get your

12
00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.899
requirements right in the first place.

13
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.869
But with off-the-shelf, well, you basically get exactly what you pay for,

14
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:46.134
or you may need to continually pay a third-party vendor high fees and

15
00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:50.919
long turnaround times for further product customization.

16
00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:52.939
So what are off-the-shelf solutions?

17
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.909
Well, they're pre-built boxed solutions.

18
00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.419
These are software solutions aimed at addressing specific needs,

19
00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:04.899
but they are targeted towards a mass market audience or a broad industry.

20
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.899
They are very affordable by leveraging distributed costs.

21
00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.924
Off-the-shelf solutions are typically affordable because their

22
00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:15.909
development costs are distributed across the broader audience.

23
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.909
Features tend to be one size fits all.

24
00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.889
Since they are targeted for a broad audience, you get what you get.

25
00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:27.879
Its features and functions have to be more generic or massively more complex.

26
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:28.939
Very feature rich.

27
00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.889
Since they need broad appeal, they can be loaded with tons of features.

28
00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.919
Now, you may have to adjust your processes and behavior.

29
00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:40.511
How you do your business now is likely not how the

30
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.879
solution would like you to do your business.

31
00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:46.899
Most off-the-shelf solutions will not be a perfect fit for your company.

32
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.949
The fact that you will have to adjust your processes is a hidden cost,

33
00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:53.869
such as training, staffing, equipment, you name it.

34
00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.909
On the other hand, if you have very weak processes,

35
00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.929
you can simply adopt the business flows of the solution and possibly save money.

36
00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.909
Let's reset for a moment and look at our options.

37
00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.929
The first, we have fully customized software.

38
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.679
In this option,

39
00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.906
you create a custom piece of software to meet every business challenge you have,

40
00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:17.186
a fully integrated solution that matches your

41
00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:18.929
processes and business requirements.

42
00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.929
Next, off-the-shelf software, which we have just defined on the last slide.

43
00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.909
It may be more affordable, may meet your needs,

44
00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.899
but likely has more functionality than you need,

45
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.869
which is not that bad since you may grow into it.

46
00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.889
An example would be Microsoft Dynamics 365.

47
00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.899
Next is what I'm calling off-the-shelf plus.

48
00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.043
There are some commercial software solutions that you can buy

49
00:02:41.043 --> 00:02:42.717
that have after-market customizable support,

50
00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:47.490
which allows you to start with a strong foundational base and refine it to

51
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.899
meet your needs using third-party software companies.

52
00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:51.959
An example would be Salesforce.

53
00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.449
If you take this option,

54
00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.929
you want a large number of third-party vendors to choose from.

55
00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:00.743
These vendors can provide software add-ons and skilled people

56
00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.929
to help you transition to your new solution.

57
00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:06.909
Lastly, customized software with off-the-shelf components.

58
00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.152
This might be the best of both worlds since this option can be a

59
00:03:11.152 --> 00:03:14.909
cost-efficient way to obtain the leverage of off-the-shelf solutions,

60
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.929
but wrapped by custom software to more closely align with your requirements,

61
00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.884
and hopefully not incurring the same level of cost

62
00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:25.929
as if it was all customizable.

63
00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.869
Why use off-the-shelf software?

64
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.899
Well, lower upfront cost.

65
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.795
Certainly a great appeal since most solutions now are subscription based,

66
00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:37.919
so you don't have a huge capital expense.

67
00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.909
Feature rich, so it'll more likely cover all of your requirements.

68
00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.939
May meet most of your business needs because it's, in fact, feature rich.

69
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.919
Support is often included or can be added with a maintenance contract.

70
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.949
That's a plus.

71
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:56.889
User communities across the internet and forums help provide self-help support.

72
00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.919
The better the ecosystem of the solution,

73
00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.869
the more support options you will have, so look for that.

74
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.959
Quick to deploy.

75
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.899
Well, on a click of a button,

76
00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.673
you might be up and running and not have to wait for a

77
00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:09.909
long custom development project.

78
00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.340
All design, development, QA testing is handled by the vendor,

79
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.899
not you, and thus keeping your labor costs down.

80
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.889
When might you use off-the-shelf software?

81
00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.869
No internal development staff.

82
00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:23.899
Well, that makes sense.

83
00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:25.879
Time to market is critical.

84
00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.959
So you don't have any time to build your custom solutions?

85
00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:30.879
Well, off-the-shelf may be for you.

86
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.919
So many choices in the cloud, how can you not at least look?

87
00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.939
There are countless apps and services in the marketplace today.

88
00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.442
Great for back office requirements since this type of requirement tends

89
00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:45.705
to meet most companies' requirements pretty closely,

90
00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:49.869
such as payroll, HR applications, time and labor tracking,

91
00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:52.869
desktop tools, disk space, virtual servers,

92
00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.909
project management tools, and many more.

93
00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.944
I will talk a little more about back office

94
00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:59.959
requirements later on in this module.

95
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.959
In the case of off-shelf solutions, the examples are endless.

96
00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:06.959
But just so you get the idea, here are a few examples.

97
00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:11.879
Certainly in the Office environment, Microsoft Office 365, the G Suite.

98
00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.869
In project management, Atlassian, Monday.

99
00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:16.919
In payroll, ADP, Kronos.

100
00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.959
In sales, Salesforce, Micro Dynamics CRM.

101
00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.919
The complete list is almost infinite,

102
00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.606
and the cloud has enabled a whole new generation of off-the-shelf solutions,

103
00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:29.909
so check them out.

104
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.909
Here is some guidance on how to choose your off-the-shelf solution.

105
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.889
Well first, choose wisely.

106
00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.348
The decision between a custom piece of business software and a

107
00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:41.919
prepackaged solution is one that can have far-reaching consequences

108
00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.909
that are felt for years down the road.

109
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.889
Therefore, think long term.

110
00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.566
It's imperative that you make the decision with the

111
00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:49.939
long-term ramifications in mind.

112
00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.228
Short-term pain will often lead to long-term gain,

113
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.869
while the unenviable opposite can also be true.

114
00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:57.919
Document your requirements.

115
00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.949
Document your needs, key features, etc.

116
00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.869
Since you are a business analyst at heart,

117
00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:04.904
you should be able to quickly develop a business

118
00:06:04.904 --> 00:06:06.939
requirements document for off-the-shelf solutions.

119
00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:09.959
Research your potential options and do a gap analysis.

120
00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:14.080
A gap analysis is a comparison of your requirements versus the

121
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.899
features offered by the solution providers.

122
00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:19.939
The smaller the gap, the better they meet your requirements.

123
00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.949
Experiment with trial solutions.

124
00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.879
In other words, pay a nominal fee and take a test run.

125
00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:26.949
And if the trial looks promising,

126
00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.479
then try a pilot with a subset of eager users to truly prove

127
00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.959
out some use cases in your environment.

128
00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.651
If you want to differentiate your company from the pack,

129
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:41.139
you may need very unique and special solutions,

130
00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.919
and hence, off-the-shelf solutions may not be for you.

131
00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.939
So let's dig a little further into that concept.

132
00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.135
Here is some guidance on when to choose off-the-shelf software versus

133
00:06:52.135 --> 00:06:55.879
custom software from a slightly different perspective.

134
00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.959
For applications that do not interact with your customers or suppliers,

135
00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:02.869
such as payroll, timekeeping, office products,

136
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:05.869
and job posting, for example, that would make sense.

137
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:06.959
You may want to consider off-the-shelf.

138
00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.805
Trust me,

139
00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:11.225
your customers do not care whether you get paid or

140
00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:12.939
what email environment you are using.

141
00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:14.919
Therefore, choosing out-of-the-box,

142
00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.894
pre-made solutions may work just great because your customers

143
00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:20.949
are not interacting with those applications.

144
00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.149
But your customers and suppliers do care about any interaction they

145
00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:27.909
do have with your company's processes and systems.

146
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.879
If they like the interaction, they will continue to buy from you.

147
00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:35.899
And since business is so fast moving and the market's so challenging,

148
00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:38.349
the ability to further customize your software to

149
00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:39.949
quickly meet those requirements,

150
00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:42.599
and thus differentiate your company from the pack,

151
00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:43.959
may be the path for you.

152
00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:52.000
So in this case, please consider the option of customized software with off-the-shelf components.
