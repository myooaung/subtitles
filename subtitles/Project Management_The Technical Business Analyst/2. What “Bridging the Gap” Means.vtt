00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:05.397
In this section, we will discuss what bridging the gap means.

2
00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:10.317
The phrase, bridge the gap, is a vernacular, so let's define it.

3
00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:16.377
To serve as or create a connection between two disconnected or disparate things.

4
00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:18.377
Those are interesting words for sure.

5
00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:22.881
I am suggesting to you that the business and IT in many organizations

6
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:26.675
can be a bit disconnected or have disparate concerns,

7
00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:32.104
and it is the role of the technical business analyst to help bridge or better

8
00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:36.317
connect them for the long-term success of the business.

9
00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:39.357
So it looks like you, the technical business analyst,

10
00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:43.407
will have your work cut out for you, indeed.

11
00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:46.347
Businesses need to improve productivity,

12
00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:49.387
cut costs, grow market share, and basically to make money,

13
00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:53.471
so often technology is the enabler which allows the

14
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:55.327
business to achieve those goals.

15
00:00:55.327 --> 00:00:55.756
Thus,

16
00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:59.456
the technical BA is the professional who ensures the

17
00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:01.337
technology meets those business needs.

18
00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:04.357
That is a very important mission and should not be taken lightly.

19
00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:08.027
Technical BA's understand the goals of the business and must never

20
00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:10.714
lose sight of this key requirement of their job.

21
00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:14.350
The technical BA is the bridge between what the

22
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.397
business needs and the ultimate solution.

23
00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:16.897
In order to be effective,

24
00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:20.933
a technical BA must understand the business and have an

25
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:25.040
intimate knowledge of the business processes and needs of the

26
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.710
organization they are working for.

27
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.377
And, at the same time,

28
00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:31.724
the technical BA must understand the challenges and capabilities of

29
00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:36.712
technology in the market in general and the technologies and skills of

30
00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:39.337
the IT organization they are working with.

31
00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:41.803
They need to bridge the double gap, that is,

32
00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:46.407
the technical BA will not only be bridging the gap between the business and IT,

33
00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:49.664
but also between your organization's technology

34
00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:52.862
applications and what is out in the market today,

35
00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:56.357
especially if you have agent applications and infrastructure.

36
00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:59.377
Let's check out a few more items.

37
00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:03.340
The technical BA must have a solid awareness of an

38
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.367
organization's as-is technology portfolio,

39
00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:06.727
such as its applications,

40
00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:10.317
and especially the myriad of challenges to deploy

41
00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:11.407
and operate those technologies.

42
00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:15.407
This is where the benefit and merit at having a technical BA rests.

43
00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:19.145
They are skilled professionals who use their business and

44
00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.500
analytical skills to understand the problems,

45
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.486
requirements, and goals of the business,

46
00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:27.940
and at the same time they leverage their communication and technical

47
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.337
competencies to work with the technical teams to develop suitable solutions

48
00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:35.387
and to deliver the solutions on time and on budget.

49
00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:39.508
The technical BA is positioned at the juncture and the

50
00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:42.337
confluence of business and technology.

51
00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:45.367
Now, the technical BA avoids throwing it over the wall.

52
00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:48.887
In the past, and maybe even today, there was a chasm,

53
00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:50.367
a really big gap,

54
00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:54.347
where the pure business analysts wrote the business requirements and threw,

55
00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:58.327
if you will, the specs over the wall to the IT development team.

56
00:02:58.327 --> 00:03:01.127
We all know that does not work.

57
00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:04.387
Solution teams need to be fully integrated and cooperate.

58
00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:13.000
Wow, what a great place for you, the technical BA, to be positioned professionally.
