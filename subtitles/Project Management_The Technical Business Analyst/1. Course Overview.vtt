00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.515
Hello.

2
00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:03.090
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.197
I will be summarizing key learning objectives in the

4
00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:10.090
course The Technical Business Analyst.

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, you made it through the course.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.080
Congratulations.

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.090
Now let's take a quick look at what's in this module.

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.090
We covered what is the technical business analyst,

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.070
bridging the gap between business and IT,

10
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.020
the tools of the trade, the technical business analyst in the agile world.

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.166
Also, you might be interested in certifications and training opportunities,

12
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.010
so I'll talk about those.

13
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.834
And lastly,

14
00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:38.070
companion Pluralsight courses that will enhance your technical BA skillset.

15
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
Okay, let's get started.

16
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.070
What is the technical business analyst?

17
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.060
Here are the key takeaways for that module.

18
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.144
The technical BA role is a business analyst who in addition to

19
00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:53.910
the typical business analyst responsibilities also utilizes more

20
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.010
complex analysis and technical tools,

21
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.030
possesses greater business knowledge and technical understanding of systems,

22
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.911
and can communicate with a richer and deeper level to both

23
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:07.040
the business and technical communities.

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.010
This can be challenging, so brush up on your communication skills,

25
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.080
that is the written, verbal, and interpersonal.

26
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.070
You need to be an excellent business analyst

27
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.070
transforming business needs into requirements.

28
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.000
That's number one to me.

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.040
You will determine why you need a new system and what it will do,

30
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.434
leveraging and using the necessary technical tools to

31
00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.050
better convey those requirements.

32
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.070
Those are the ones we covered in the module The Tools of the Trade.

33
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.910
And lastly,

34
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.661
to have a good knowledge of the technical solutions to enable better

35
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:41.050
communication without determining how the system will be developed.

36
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.030
Okay, definitely a step up from a traditional business analyst.

37
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.020
Bridging the Gap Between Business and IT,

38
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.010
here are the key takeaways for that module.

39
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.868
The technical BA straddles the line between IT and the business to

40
00:01:56.868 --> 00:02:02.000
help bridge the gap to improve business efficiency.

41
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.082
The technical business analyst plays a very important role in helping

42
00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:08.060
guide business outcomes by improving processes,

43
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.070
products, services with technical solutions through their analysis acumen,

44
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.050
technical knowledge, and leadership.

45
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.090
It is important to understand the context of the organization

46
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.070
and your position and relationship with it.

47
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.275
All work in the company can be defined as being in one of

48
00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.555
three general categories: operations, projects,

49
00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.070
and initiatives.

50
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.356
So a newer,

51
00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:36.090
less experienced technical BA may fit very nicely in the operations area.

52
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.538
Someone more experienced with the business and

53
00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:42.020
technology would be best placed on projects.

54
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.920
And lastly,

55
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.723
a very experienced and seasoned technical BA would be

56
00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:51.030
required for initiative activities.

57
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.080
The next module was Tools of the Trade.

58
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.010
A good tool improves the way you work.

59
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.030
A great tool improves the way you think.

60
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.462
Just the process of using a tool can elicit so many new questions leading to

61
00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:07.090
new insights or lead to even cooler ideas and innovations.

62
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.070
Most analysts use visual diagramming techniques,

63
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.815
tools you can use with visual interfaces or expressions of

64
00:03:13.815 --> 00:03:17.020
information will be the most productive and revealing.

65
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.000
Please always consider using visual tools.

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.677
I introduced you to the magnificent seven of the technical BA skill

67
00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:27.050
areas where you should focus your energies and time.

68
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.050
Let's touch on each one of the big takeaways of those seven.

69
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.060
We talked about when to use UI and UX tools.

70
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.397
Well,

71
00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:40.030
whenever there is a visual or user experience requirement anywhere and anytime,

72
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.080
usually this means web pages, desktop apps,

73
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.080
phone applications, numerical control applications,

74
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.040
so anything that a human will visually see and experience to get the job done.

75
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.738
Data modeling provides an enormous amount of business

76
00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:56.043
knowledge that you need to know to enhance your deeper

77
00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:58.010
understanding of the requirements.

78
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.572
It is a very valuable process of eliciting and validating

79
00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:06.020
requirements much beyond the data itself.

80
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.000
Let's continue with The Tools of the Trade part two.

81
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Today, we are awash in data,

82
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.402
so having good technical and analytical skills and tools to

83
00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:17.060
make sense of all this data is critical.

84
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.070
You should have a data analytics tool or two in your hip pocket.

85
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.830
The majority of the interface analysis you do will be around

86
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.400
consuming or designing internal APIs in your company and by

87
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.060
leveraging existing commercial APIs, just like Uber did.

88
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.020
The new buzzword today though is platforms.

89
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.050
You may want to do some research or reading on leveraging platform technologies.

90
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.090
That's like APIs on steroids.

91
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.259
The technical BA is very well-suited to designing and

92
00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.070
authoring the test plan and test cases.

93
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.067
The technical BA can play a role and bridge the gap by providing

94
00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:55.825
high-level QA planning material to the developers and/or in

95
00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:58.090
support of the quality assurance team.

96
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.565
Off-the-shelf solutions may fit best for back office

97
00:05:02.565 --> 00:05:04.050
applications and requirements,

98
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.824
and customized software with off-the-shelf components may be the

99
00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:11.020
best to differentiate your company from the pack,

100
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.000
as well as provide a shorter time to market approach versus pure custom apps.

101
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.070
Prototyping is one of your most important skills.

102
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.453
Prototyping produces an early model of the potential ultimate

103
00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:26.050
solution based on the known requirements.

104
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.050
You will be using most of the magnificent seven skill areas to do prototyping.

105
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.820
That is, UI/UX design, data modeling, business data analytics,

106
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.020
interface analysis,

107
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.030
and being able to design solutions with off-the-shelf components and systems.

108
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.020
The Technical BA in the Agile World.

109
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.534
It is likely that the technical BA will spend more time and value in

110
00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:56.629
project and release planning activities and likely less in iteration or

111
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.090
sprint and daily work planning activities.

112
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.461
Hence,

113
00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:03.824
the technical BA is supporting and enhancing the translation of

114
00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:06.050
business requirements into technical requirements.

115
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.472
Since business people are great at business and technical

116
00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:11.060
people are great at highly technical activities,

117
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.628
it allows an opportunity for the technical BA to bridge

118
00:06:14.628 --> 00:06:17.020
the gap in the agile world as well.

119
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.030
They can develop epic and user story documentation,

120
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.060
and both are written in business and user-oriented terms.

121
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.810
Both of these are great candidates where the

122
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.060
technical BA can contribute very nicely.

123
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.060
They should invest in INVEST.

124
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.020
I highly recommend that you write your user stories

125
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.020
following the INVEST techniques.

126
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.010
Think of it as a checklist to bounce each of your user stories off of.

127
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.010
Remember, very important, better stories result in better outcomes,

128
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.090
yielding value to the business quicker.

129
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.050
Participating with the agile dev teams.

130
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.000
Now, based on the nature of the makeup of the team,

131
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.040
the user stories, and your organization's resources,

132
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.050
which may be limited,

133
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.477
sharing the technical BA across multiple teams is an option certainly,

134
00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:06.090
or maybe even dedicated to one team for very large important projects.

135
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.000
The technical BA can also be a proxy to the product owner.

136
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.231
Now,

137
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.050
a proxy is someone who has the authority to represent

138
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.080
someone else such as a representative, substitute or delegate,

139
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.010
or the other option is to partner with the product owner.

140
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.050
Either of these is a natural for a technical BA.

141
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.530
The product owners are usually extremely busy and could

142
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.050
certainly use not only your help, but your guidance and leadership as well.

143
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.890
Since the developers and technical team will be focused on the solution,

144
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.050
as they should be,

145
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.326
therefore you can provide the organization's big picture and what the

146
00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.050
enterprise management is thinking from a business perspective.

147
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.451
The technical BA provides reinforcement of the

148
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:52.000
product owner's vision to the dev team, and that will greatly help bridge the gap as well.
