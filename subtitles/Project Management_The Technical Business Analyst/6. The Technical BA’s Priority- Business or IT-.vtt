00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:04.897
The technical business analyst's priority, is it business or IT?

2
00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:07.825
What do you think it should be?

3
00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:12.835
Should you, the technical business analyst, be more business or IT focused?

4
00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:15.775
So before I begin this slide, what do you think?

5
00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:17.805
A more business or IT focus?

6
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:19.205
On the business side of the house,

7
00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.825
we will focus on things like why build this solution?

8
00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.835
Is there a business case to support why this is a good endeavor?

9
00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:26.815
What will the solution do for the company?

10
00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.745
What are the business goals it will accomplish?

11
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.755
How will the solution work to help the business,

12
00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:35.785
such as reduce costs, increase revenue or improve customer service?

13
00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.765
Now, on the IT side of things,

14
00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:41.106
you will focus on communicating requirements to IT and

15
00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.093
having all those discussions around that,

16
00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.755
of course, determining the options and solutions.

17
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:46.835
How will the solution get implemented?

18
00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:49.613
You will need to know this since you will need to convey back

19
00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:51.795
to the business what the impacts will be,

20
00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:54.775
training requirements, budgets, schedules,

21
00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:56.795
new skill requirements, they're all of that.

22
00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:59.825
Can new technology drive new business opportunities?

23
00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.775
Well, I sure hope so.

24
00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:03.825
We will dive into this topic more on the next slide.

25
00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:08.795
For me, business should be the main driver of what you do most of the time.

26
00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:11.795
By representing the business needs to IT,

27
00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.745
being the interface, the go between, the broker,

28
00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:19.825
the bridge, and the master of all between the business and IT.

29
00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:21.815
Those are just a few examples of course.

30
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.502
This is why the technical business analyst is such an

31
00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:26.835
exciting position or role in a company.

32
00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:30.686
You will get to understand the challenging business goals and just what

33
00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:33.145
makes your company successful in the marketplace,

34
00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.328
and, at the same time,

35
00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:40.815
participate in helping shape the technology solutions to meet those goals.

36
00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.755
Technologies can drive business opportunities as well.

37
00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:49.292
So new technologies may provide the catalyst for exploring totally new business

38
00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.835
ideas that the business may never have thought of before.

39
00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:52.205
Yes,

40
00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:56.765
you may normally get key business drivers from the business side of the house,

41
00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:59.934
but you are well positioned to recommend new and potentially

42
00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.755
disruptive technologies to the business.

43
00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.755
Technology is always changing,

44
00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.369
so there is no way I can list all the technologies you may

45
00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.755
need to know about at this point and time.

46
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:14.389
But what you can do is try and stay abreast of the trends and how a

47
00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.825
new technology could potentially help the business.

48
00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:19.160
Since the business is not necessarily paying that

49
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.775
close of attention to technology, this would be your job.

50
00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:27.765
Now, here are a few technologies you might want to explore.

51
00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:30.300
Here are some technologies that have been clearly

52
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.815
driving new business opportunities.

53
00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:35.805
Artificial intelligence, many businesses take up artificial intelligence,

54
00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.762
AI technology, to try to reduce operational costs,

55
00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:42.795
increase efficiency, grow revenue, and improve customer service.

56
00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:43.298
Blockchain.

57
00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:46.835
Many industry leaders have already achieved significant business benefits,

58
00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:50.775
including greater transparency, enhanced security,

59
00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:53.775
improved traceability, increased efficiency,

60
00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:55.815
and speed of transactions and reduced costs.

61
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:58.795
Read how blockchain provides these benefits to learn more

62
00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:00.775
about using blockchain in your industry.

63
00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:01.458
Cyber security.

64
00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:06.745
A lack of focus on cyber security can be greatly damaging to a business.

65
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:09.792
There is the direct economic costs of such attacks to the business,

66
00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:12.914
such as theft of corporate information or disruption to trading

67
00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:15.128
or even having to repair effective systems,

68
00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.835
all resulting in financial loss.

69
00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:17.580
Cloud computing.

70
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.472
Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of

71
00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:21.785
managing and maintaining your IT systems.

72
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:25.708
Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business,

73
00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:28.874
you can reduce your costs by using the resources of

74
00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.755
your cloud computing service provider.

75
00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:33.745
Your energy consumption costs may be reduced, as well, of course.

76
00:03:33.745 --> 00:03:35.805
Big data, and it gets bigger every day.

77
00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:39.762
It's so important today, big data can affect the business's valuation.

78
00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:43.318
It's a key and tangible asset that can now be gauged through

79
00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:45.785
data collection and factored into valuation.

80
00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:49.609
How businesses use data and the decisions they make based on data is

81
00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.805
also going to affect success rates of companies.

82
00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:54.005
The Internet of Things, IoT.

83
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:58.755
Now, IoT devices record and transfer data to monitor important processes,

84
00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.765
give us new insights, boost efficiencies,

85
00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:02.815
and allow companies to make more informed decisions.

86
00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:06.765
The IoT market, which includes the hardware and software,

87
00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:09.488
systems integration and data and telecom services and people,

88
00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:14.745
is expected to grow to over $500 billion in the year 2021.

89
00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:16.825
Now, the Internet of Things is driving a lot of data.

90
00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:17.191
Well,

91
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.785
that's why you need big data technologies to manage and mine

92
00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:23.755
and ascertain what the IoT devices are doing.

93
00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:24.039
Okay.

94
00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.835
So take a moment right now and think about each one of these,

95
00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:29.795
and can your business benefit from any one of these?

96
00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:37.000
Produce your own list of technologies and you will be pleasantly surprised of how many great ideas you may come up with.
