1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,711
What I mean by the missing piece is that the technical BA is a role that

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:08,905
must be both business oriented and technically oriented.

3
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,865
Very challenging, indeed.

4
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:13,745
So the technical business analyst is the professional who is

5
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:16,528
generally associated with the following: Business requirements

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,032
gathering and analysis on IT projects,

7
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:22,872
using more complex technical processes and tools,

8
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:25,865
and solving problems with technical solutions.

9
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:27,895
One of those problems may be, as examples,

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:31,424
Software as a Service, SaaS,

11
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:35,855
which a third-party provider hosts applications on the internet,

12
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:38,845
such as Salesforce, for example, plus thousands more.

13
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:42,880
Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS, and Platform as a Service,

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,875
PaaS, are also key cloud computing, off-the-shelf offerings.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,741
Custom development.

16
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:52,898
The technical business analyst needs to understand the custom

17
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:55,865
development processes and common tools used today.

18
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:59,429
This includes the lifecycle models of waterfall and agile,

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,845
plus the accompanying technical tools to support the processes.

20
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,148
And, complex integrations.

21
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:07,865
So much work today is all about integrating systems.

22
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:11,007
About every service and product has APIs,

23
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,681
known as Application Programmer Interfaces,

24
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:18,158
which allows access to the features or data of an application or

25
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,875
other service to be easily accessible and shareable.

26
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,875
For example, when you post to LinkedIn, you could also have it push to Twitter.

27
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,845
In this case, LinkedIn is leveraging Twitter's APIs to do this.

28
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:29,357
Next,

29
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:32,342
collaborating with information technology experts in

30
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,051
determining the desired solutions,

31
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:37,835
so working with your IT professionals in your company,

32
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:41,825
or consultants, or other IT vendors is a common daily activity.

33
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,855
This is a crucial role in the bridge between business and IT.

34
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,895
I will get into more detail in the technical skills needed by the

35
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:53,835
technical business analyst later in this module.

36
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:57,880
A Day in the Life of a Technical Business Analyst slide is a broad view of

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,835
what a typical day may look like for a technical BA.

38
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,885
Organizationally positioned in IT or PMO.

39
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:08,235
They are usually not employed in the business side of the organization,

40
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:10,825
but instead in the IT department.

41
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,594
If the organization has a PMO, a project management office,

42
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,865
they may be staffed there as well.

43
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:21,325
By the way, a PMO is charted with selecting and executing IT projects,

44
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:25,385
hence the technical BA will work on both the selection

45
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:30,825
and execution aspects of the project, if connected or positioned in the PMO.

46
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:34,167
From the business side, they are the ones eliciting broader,

47
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:37,855
mode complex requirements from stakeholders and analyzing those requirements,

48
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:39,875
then documenting those requirements,

49
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,845
likely using more complex requirements management tools.

50
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,109
These documents are known as business requirements documents,

51
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:49,825
or BRDs, from which they will create functional specifications,

52
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,895
also known as FRDs, functional requirements documents.

53
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:56,095
These documents contain the application's functional requirements,

54
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:59,855
they define things such as data models, data manipulation,

55
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:02,835
processing, workflows, screen layouts,

56
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,825
user interface and interaction with the application.

57
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:08,845
These are technical documents.

58
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:13,006
Lastly, the technical BA interacts directly with the technical teams,

59
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:15,370
such as developers, creatives, architects,

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,855
data engineers,

61
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:21,218
and quality assurance professionals to ensure they understand the requirements,

62
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,835
answer questions, take issues back to the business,

63
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:28,075
and ensure that the technical implementations ultimately meet the

64
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,855
business requirements and objectives of the project.

65
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:35,635
Since the technical BA typically has a role squarely in

66
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:39,875
the IT organization of a company, they need to know a few more things.

67
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,875
This first list is centered more around process.

68
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,863
They must have a good understanding and appreciation of the

69
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:48,825
myriad of processes around software development.

70
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:49,875
Gathering and managing requirements,

71
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,244
this skill should be second nature and leverage best tools to capture,

72
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:54,905
track, and manage those requirements.

73
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:57,895
Understanding and use of waterfall.

74
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:00,835
With the waterfall project development approach,

75
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:03,905
a technical BA working in a classic development environment

76
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:06,539
is more heavily involved at the beginning,

77
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,825
gathering, analyzing, and prioritizing these requirements,

78
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,835
and later in the project lifecycle,

79
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,179
handing those off to developers and then moving on to

80
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,865
another software development project.

81
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:17,895
Understanding the use of agile.

82
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:20,915
Agile has changed the timing of the BA's involvement

83
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,865
with the given development project.

84
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:27,845
With agile, they are involved throughout the entire agile project lifecycle.

85
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:28,967
I like this much better.

86
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,986
So they generally stay with the project through multiple

87
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,905
releases to a project's completion,

88
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:37,835
designing and planning test plans and test cases.

89
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:40,174
This is a likely role as well since you will be intimately

90
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,563
involved in the requirements side of the house,

91
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:45,255
you will know exactly what to expect from the system,

92
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:48,835
as well as have a relationship with the business side.

93
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:53,875
Now this makes you a great candidate to design and plan the system's testing.

94
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,905
And again, these are centered more around process,

95
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:59,835
whereas this list is focused more on technology.

96
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:03,375
Technology stacks is a list of all the technology services

97
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,885
used to build and run one single application.

98
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,855
The social site Facebook, for example,

99
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:11,095
is composed of a combination of coding frameworks and languages,

100
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:14,759
including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and React JS,

101
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,895
plus many others.

102
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:18,885
All these make up the stack.

103
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,375
DevOps.

104
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,870
Now, DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies,

105
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,218
practices,

106
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:27,775
and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver

107
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:30,855
applications and services at a high velocity.

108
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,915
Sometimes we refer to this process as Continuous Integration.

109
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:38,825
You should be aware of this process and how it can affect delivering software.

110
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:42,825
Now there are many Continuous Integration tools such as Bamboo, for example.

111
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:43,875
Skilled at software testing.

112
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:48,031
Software testing is a process to evaluate the functionality of a

113
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:51,502
software application with the intent to find whether the developed

114
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:55,202
software met the requirements or not and to identify any defects to

115
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,865
ensure that the product is defect-free.

116
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,525
This will potentially include automated testing tools

117
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:03,855
such as Selenium and Katalon Studio, for example.

118
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,905
Experiencing appreciation for managing user acceptance.

119
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,525
User acceptance testing, UAT,

120
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:12,875
is typically the last phase of a software testing process.

121
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,744
During UAT,

122
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:19,365
the users test a software to make sure it can handle the required tasks in

123
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:22,218
a real-world scenario according to the specifications.

124
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,895
You should be involved in that process as well.

125
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,895
Awareness of system usage trends.

126
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:30,410
Well, after all that hard work, is the software being used?

127
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,905
How is it being used?

128
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:33,865
Is it really helping the business?

129
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:36,855
Will the company achieve a return on investment?

130
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,915
You should be prepared to answer those questions,

131
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:42,505
and especially the ROI, or the return on investment,

132
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,905
is it substantiated?

133
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,915
I would like to make a key point.

134
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:51,355
Organizations that recognize the importance of the critical

135
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:54,825
contributions technical business analysts provide will flourish.

136
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:58,293
The bottom line is that the goal or outcome of business analysts conducted by

137
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:03,741
technical business analysts is to ensure that the growth of the organization is

138
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:07,888
in alignment with the goals and objectives set by its management and is focused

139
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:16,000
on improving an organization's long-term success by selecting and implementing the appropriate technologies.
