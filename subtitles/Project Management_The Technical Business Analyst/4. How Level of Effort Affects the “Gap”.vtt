00:00:00.573 --> 00:00:03.370
Now I would like to define the term level of effort, or LOE.

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.483
LOE is used to define the amount of work you must

3
00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:09.583
complete to get something done.

4
00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:12.070
LOE is measured in days or hours per day,

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.113
per week or per month, or in a relative manner such as large,

6
00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:21.583
medium or small, and scheduled within a relative timeframe.

7
00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:22.039
For example,

8
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.573
how much elapsed time do you need in order to expend the 500 hours of work?

9
00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:32.603
Well, we need 5 months elapsed time since I can only afford 100 hours per month.

10
00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:36.466
Now let's see some other examples of level of effort for each

11
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:40.573
work type and how that relates to the gap.

12
00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.553
Let's look at some level of effort examples.

13
00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:48.553
For operations, LOE's are small and certainly smaller than the other two.

14
00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:52.643
An example, enhance the user profile page for a healthcare enrollment system.

15
00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:55.593
Maybe that is about 50 to 100 hours, say.

16
00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:56.475
For projects,

17
00:00:56.475 --> 00:01:01.623
LOE's are more of the medium size and more analysis is usually required as well.

18
00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:03.267
A simple example may be,

19
00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:07.603
add a new module to enable users to fill out a healthcare application online.

20
00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:10.553
This could be 4, 000 hours possibly.

21
00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:12.840
Now for initiatives, LOE's are much,

22
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.593
much larger with large budgets and senior executive oversight,

23
00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:19.633
that is people with a lot of influence and a lot at stake.

24
00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:24.405
An example may be to develop a brand-new healthcare application that may

25
00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:27.573
take a multi-million dollar investment to do that.

26
00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:33.093
So you can see a general size or level of effort or scale of what

27
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.633
constitutes an operational project or an initiative-type activity.

28
00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:37.031
Now,

29
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.613
accepting my premise that all work can be categorized

30
00:01:40.613 --> 00:01:42.255
into one of these three categories,

31
00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:48.613
let's look at the gap and how it relates to these activity categories.

32
00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:52.434
Now let's compare and contrast the gap versus the business

33
00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:54.563
activity categories we just discussed.

34
00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:58.553
For operations, the gap and level of effort is small.

35
00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:01.583
There is much less business and technical knowledge required,

36
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:03.633
and therefore has a smaller impact to the business

37
00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.623
and an easier gap to straddle.

38
00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:08.742
Now projects have a larger level of effort than operations,

39
00:02:08.742 --> 00:02:11.033
and hence you have a larger gap to straddle with greater

40
00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:14.633
business requirements and technical solutions.

41
00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.583
This to me would be much more challenging of a gap.

42
00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:21.606
Lastly, for initiatives, these activities are large or very large,

43
00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:23.633
and your gap may be huge.

44
00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:26.943
You have an enormous amount of requirements with complex

45
00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:29.633
interdependencies and complex technical solutions.

46
00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:35.573
By far, this is a much larger and more challenging and demanding gap to straddle.

47
00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:40.563
Now let's look at what you need to know to best straddle these gaps.

48
00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:42.940
Now let's look at the gap versus the business and

49
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.573
technology knowledge you need to know.

50
00:02:45.573 --> 00:02:49.829
For operations, the gap is typically the smallest of the three activity types,

51
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.434
and your knowledge of the business may be on a few systems and the technical

52
00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:57.723
knowledge you need would be less as well since those systems will likely

53
00:02:57.723 --> 00:03:00.593
already exist with the particular technology stack.

54
00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:00.698
Hence,

55
00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:03.124
you do not need to know as much about the business and

56
00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:05.593
the technology challenges are small.

57
00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:09.276
For projects, technical BA knowledge requirements will broaden.

58
00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:13.563
Projects are typically delivering new business functions and features,

59
00:03:13.563 --> 00:03:16.630
so you need to know how they add value to the business and their priorities,

60
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.613
plus you will need some knowledge of the target technologies so when

61
00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:23.553
the technical team walks you through their plans,

62
00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:26.209
they can make some sense to you that their solutions would,

63
00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.593
in fact, enable success.

64
00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:30.633
Based on the number or size of projects,

65
00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.563
the technical BA needs to be very experienced.

66
00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:35.661
Now, on to initiatives.

67
00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:37.583
This is the grand-daddy of them all.

68
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:41.573
For initiatives, these activities are large or very large.

69
00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:42.393
In fact,

70
00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:45.128
corporate-wide activities require an enormous amount of

71
00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:46.633
strategic business domain knowledge,

72
00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:50.603
which may require very complex technical solutions to solve.

73
00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:54.023
A very seasoned and experienced technical BA is

74
00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:56.603
absolutely required for this work type.

75
00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.876
So a newer,

76
00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:01.643
less experienced technical BA may fit very nicely in the operations area.

77
00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:04.259
Someone more experienced with the business and

78
00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.613
technology would be best placed on projects.

79
00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:07.473
And lastly,

80
00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:12.573
a very experienced technical BA would be required for initiative activities.

81
00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:15.563
Think about your role in your company for a moment.

82
00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:16.623
Where are you positioned?

83
00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:21.440
Do you perform more operations work, project work or initiative work,

84
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.623
or maybe a mix?

85
00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:28.000
Where would you rather be positioned? Are you ready for the challenge?
