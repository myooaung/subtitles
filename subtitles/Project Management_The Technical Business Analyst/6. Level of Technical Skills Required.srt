1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,178
Now let's look at the level of technical skills

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:07,579
required to be a successful technical BA.

3
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:11,041
While the knowledge of IT is not a prerequisite for

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,007
all business analyst positions,

5
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:15,519
sufficient understanding of the latest technology trends

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,741
would definitely add value to the technical business analyst

7
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,499
capabilities and contributions.

8
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:23,579
Therefore, what level of IT knowledge is enough?

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,519
Or, how technical should a technical BA be?

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,509
Well, it depends.

11
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:32,842
You were probably hoping I had the perfect answer for the $100,

12
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,509
000 question, but I don't.

13
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:35,519
It truly depends.

14
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,529
You just need to be technical enough to bridge the gap.

15
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:39,798
And every gap is different,

16
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:42,309
and every company based on the abilities of the business

17
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,589
side and the technical side as well.

18
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:48,064
For example, the pure business analyst, that is a non-technical analyst,

19
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:51,232
talking to a highly technical developer may have

20
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:53,529
many challenges in communicating.

21
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:57,549
That might be too big a communications gap to cross effectively.

22
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,472
Know the basics of IT.

23
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:01,086
You don't have to know enough to do what the developers do,

24
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:01,589
of course,

25
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:05,549
but enough to understand what they do and to be able to impart

26
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,589
empathy in order to better bridge the gap.

27
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:13,210
The technical business analyst is a key role that can facilitate and optimize

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,582
the system design process by simplifying the work of designers and system

29
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:22,529
implementers further down the development process through the identification

30
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,589
of quality requirements which are correct,

31
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:29,579
complete, and doable; therefore, by applying and leveraging technical tools,

32
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,539
you'll be able to better convey business requirements

33
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,539
and features clearly and succinctly,

34
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:39,189
and hence the IT team will be more able to comprehend and develop

35
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,579
technical solutions more quickly and with better quality.

36
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,569
Now let's talk about the technical skill areas you need to master.

37
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:52,529
Here are the technical BA skill areas where you can best focus your energies.

38
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,499
Design the user interface and user experience.

39
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,569
You know the requirements and the users very well,

40
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,064
so you can provide valuable insights here by utilizing the tools,

41
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:04,549
develop the user interface, and user experience mockups.

42
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,719
The method or technique known as prototyping is used to elicit and

43
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,509
validate stakeholders or user's requirements.

44
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:15,499
Again, you can apply some great tools to reform this function as well.

45
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:16,182
Data modeling.

46
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:20,569
Today, data is everywhere, and you better know where it is and how to get to it,

47
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,569
and how to reshape or model it to meet the customer's requirements.

48
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,853
Business data analytics is the skill of analyzing raw data in

49
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,549
order to make decisions about that information.

50
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,589
This would include things like data mining, SQL, S-Q-L, and visualization.

51
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,519
Here's a couple more to focus your time on.

52
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,179
Interface analysis is a connection between two entities,

53
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,539
people, systems, applications, etc.

54
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,499
No person, system or application is an island.

55
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:50,549
Everything is connecting to everything.

56
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,529
Quality assurance, test plan, and test cases.

57
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,246
Since you understand the requirements,

58
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:59,524
you're well positioned to write the test cases and the test plans,

59
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:00,509
very important.

60
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,499
Off-the-shelf solutions, cloud services and other building blocks.

61
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,569
Not every problem should be solved by custom solutions.

62
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,509
If you can find the perfect off-the-shelf prebuilt solution, well, use it.

63
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,383
Typically though,

64
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:15,177
you may need to integrate a couple of off-the-shelf

65
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:17,499
solutions to meet your requirements.

66
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:20,875
Where you should likely not venture is deciding which program languages,

67
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,576
frameworks or technology stacks to use,

68
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:27,509
let the application developers and architects do that.

69
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,764
Now,

70
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:30,956
knowledge and skills in these areas will greatly help you bridge the

71
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,559
gap between the business and the technology teams.

72
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:33,929
Now,

73
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:38,337
we will get into much more detail in all these areas

74
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:41,519
in the module Tools of the Trade.

75
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,519
Here's my point of view.

76
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,529
Varied opinions exist on why and to what extent

77
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,529
business analysts should be technical.

78
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:49,539
There is much discourse on this topic.

79
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,219
In my opinion,

80
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,829
it is the confluence of the business analyst role and the systems

81
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,499
analyst role that were more typical many years ago.

82
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:59,509
Since organizations are much leaner today,

83
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,559
it seems that these two roles may have merged into one role or one person.

84
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,313
First and foremost,

85
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:09,089
technical BAs need to be a very strong business analyst in my view,

86
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:09,529
period.

87
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:10,100
Over time,

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,237
continue to improve your technical capabilities in order to enhance

89
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:17,529
your communication with IT and provide the added value to the

90
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,579
solutions designed and to the business.

91
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,651
If a technical analyst is too technical,

92
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:28,499
they may focus on the solution at the expense of the requirements.

93
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:31,539
I think this is a recipe for failure, so be careful about this.

94
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,905
The right amount of technical knowledge and understanding ensures that

95
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:39,146
unrealistic requirements can be discussed with the stakeholders much

96
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,549
earlier in the requirements gathering process.

97
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,504
This is not to say that the stakeholder's business ideas are wrong,

98
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,569
it will just place them in the right context for

99
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,559
developing priorities and budgets.

100
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,589
What is the right amount of technology to know?

101
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:55,539
I hope and trust this course will help guide you,

102
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,676
but you will likely have to figure it out based on the type of

103
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:02,539
organization you are in and the various skill levels of your teammates

104
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,559
and who you are and what you are capable of.

105
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,589
You still need quality business requirements.

106
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:10,499
No matter how great or cool the technology,

107
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:14,253
without high-quality business requirements that align to the

108
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:17,217
business and meet the needs of the stakeholders,

109
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,529
technology, well, to me, can be irrelevant.

110
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:24,186
Lastly, if you do in fact love development languages and tech stacks,

111
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:24,842
and the like,

112
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:27,861
then extend your career path by transitioning from a technical

113
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,569
business analyst to a developer or software engineer.

114
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,837
People with a technical BA background would make a

115
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:37,000
superb developer in my opinion. So, go for it!
