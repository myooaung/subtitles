00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.727
I would like to quickly suggest several companion courses that will

2
00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:09.159
enhance your technical BA skill capabilities.

3
00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:10.359
Early in this course,

4
00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.159
I recommended that the technical BA should be knowledgeable

5
00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.199
in agile and waterfall methodologies.

6
00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.219
My course, Developing Effective Agile Sprint Plans,

7
00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:22.479
will give you insight into agile and sprint planning that you need to help

8
00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:27.249
you better relate and communicate with the dev teams.

9
00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.169
My course, Project Management for Software Engineers,

10
00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.189
will give you insight into the five key process groups of project management.

11
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:39.886
I have seen that many companies are doing a sort of blend of the two approaches,

12
00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:41.159
agile and traditional.

13
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.169
So if you need to learn more about traditional project management,

14
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.239
you might want to check out this course.

15
00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.209
All business analysts need to know how to make estimates,

16
00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:54.159
whether you are a technical BA or any other kind of business analyst.

17
00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.189
You might want to consider this course, Best Practices for Project Estimation.

18
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.249
Leadership and Communication Skills,

19
00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.221
everything we talked about in this entire course has an

20
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:09.859
underpinning and a requirement for strong and dynamic

21
00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.229
leadership and communication skills, especially for the medium to large gaps.

22
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.907
So check out the course,

23
00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:22.000
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers. You won't regret it.
