00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.574
"Good technical analysis is a lot like clear thinking made visual.

2
00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:06.982
" I took a quote from Edward Tufte and make a little tweak to it.

3
00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:08.952
So we've come full circle.

4
00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:09.982
In the beginning of the module,

5
00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:14.962
I pointed out that 89% of analysts use visual diagramming techniques.

6
00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:18.952
I wanted to impress on you that everything should be as visual as possible,

7
00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.922
not just for user interfaces.

8
00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:24.051
Being more visual will help you better bridge the gap

9
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.615
between the business and the technical teams,

10
00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:31.892
making things easier to understand and communicate.

11
00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:32.912
Here's my point of view.

12
00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:36.982
The tools I have discussed work just as well for either waterfall or agile,

13
00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:40.922
or any other software development methodology you may be using.

14
00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:43.922
Continuously improve the tools as you see fit.

15
00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.952
Maybe add this there or that here.

16
00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:47.962
Add some documentation to help new hires.

17
00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:49.982
And keep some samples around to show others.

18
00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:53.962
Also, have a repository of all your technical BA assets.

19
00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:57.962
Hopefully having a repository in place that includes a variety of tools,

20
00:00:57.962 --> 00:00:59.442
checklists, templates,

21
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:03.302
and processes will help you increase the efficiency of

22
00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:05.892
how you operate as a technical BA.

23
00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:07.892
Not only will this greatly help you,

24
00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:10.952
but it'll be easier to cross-train new hires or new team members,

25
00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:13.962
thus allowing the whole team to work smarter.

26
00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:19.922
Get good at knowing how, when, and why to apply these methods and tools.

27
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:23.932
You know, buying the best frying pan will not make you a good cook,

28
00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:27.166
so tools won't give you good results unless you know how,

29
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.972
when, and why to apply them.

30
00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:33.942
And lastly, just as a reminder, I am not sponsoring any products mentioned,

31
00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:37.929
but only provided their names as examples that might

32
00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.982
point you in the right direction.

33
00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:44.660
This module covered my magnificent seven skill areas

34
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.902
that a technical BA should know.

35
00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:48.982
Let's touch on the key takeaways for each.

36
00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:51.912
User interface/user experience.

37
00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.962
This may be the most near and dear to the heart of the average end user.

38
00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:57.499
They love to see screens, pages,

39
00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.942
reports or anything visual that represents their world.

40
00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:02.942
It also brings you closer to them.

41
00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:06.942
You can learn so much more about the fabric and contour of their requirements.

42
00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:10.892
Plus, it is a great opportunity to build trust.

43
00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:11.892
Data modeling.

44
00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:15.114
Granted, this one may not appeal to customers and end users,

45
00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:16.962
but certainly to the app dev side of the house.

46
00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:20.892
Performing data modeling, even at a very high level,

47
00:02:20.892 --> 00:02:24.942
will help you refine the requirements and bridge the gap with the app dev team.

48
00:02:24.942 --> 00:02:26.932
Business data analytics.

49
00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:31.417
Leverage this skill area to identify and analyze data,

50
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.972
patterns, and trends to enable much more informed business decisions,

51
00:02:34.972 --> 00:02:38.572
either regarding whether you should do a new system or not,

52
00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:41.922
or simply to perform sophisticated what-if analyses.

53
00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:44.912
Remember, big data is only getting bigger,

54
00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:47.952
so these kinds of tools are a necessity.

55
00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:49.892
Interface analysis.

56
00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:53.356
The world continues to move rapidly to where an application is simply a

57
00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:57.932
collection of APIs with a custom wrapper to glue it all together.

58
00:02:57.932 --> 00:03:01.447
Now, there's a new term in the market today to keep an eye on,

59
00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:02.952
and that term is platforms.

60
00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:07.172
A platform is a group of technologies that are used as a

61
00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:11.912
base upon which other applications, processes or technologies are developed.

62
00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:13.952
It's kind of like APIs on steroids.

63
00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:15.814
So keep an eye out on that one and how that might fit

64
00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.952
into your solutions in the future.

65
00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:19.982
Quality assurance, test plan, and test cases.

66
00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:23.949
I included this skill area because there is such great synergy for

67
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.942
the technical BA to participate in test planning,

68
00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:29.902
developing test cases and, if time allows,

69
00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:31.922
the actual testing of the system.

70
00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:33.912
Off-the-shelf solutions.

71
00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:37.892
They may sound easy to procure and implement by senior management,

72
00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:38.902
but we know better.

73
00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:40.942
It takes good analysis, solid requirements,

74
00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:43.952
and product research to identify the right solutions.

75
00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:47.389
I also recommend that off-the-shelf may be easier for your

76
00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.952
back-office needs that don't have to touch the customer.

77
00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:53.962
And also that customized solutions, leveraging off-the-shelf solutions,

78
00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:59.902
APIs and platforms, may be best for your customers and supply chain users.

79
00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:00.902
Prototyping.

80
00:04:00.902 --> 00:04:02.352
Your prototyping tools of the trade are,

81
00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:06.902
in fact, most of the very things we talked about in this module.

82
00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:09.962
Most of these tools and methods are used in developing prototypes,

83
00:04:09.962 --> 00:04:11.912
so get good at them.

84
00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:13.912
Lastly, your choice.

85
00:04:13.912 --> 00:04:16.902
Maybe some of these skill areas are not relevant to you,

86
00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:19.892
and maybe there are others relevant, but not listed here.

87
00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:20.148
Well,

88
00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:23.217
it is your choice to simply use the ones you want and

89
00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:25.902
add any others you think you need.

90
00:04:25.902 --> 00:04:33.000
Most importantly, have your own technical BA tools of the trade that works for you.
