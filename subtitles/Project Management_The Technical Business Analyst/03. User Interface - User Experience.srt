1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:04,112
User interface and user experience design.

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:05,152
Do you know the difference?

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:06,152
Intrigued?

4
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:09,172
Well, let's explore further.

5
00:00:09,172 --> 00:00:13,162
Now let's define user interface and user experience.

6
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:14,859
Something that looks great,

7
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:19,705
but is difficult to use is an example of a great user

8
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,102
interface and a poor user experience,

9
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:25,614
while something very usable that looks terrible is an

10
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:31,172
example of a great user experience, but a poor user interface.

11
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:34,132
So what is UI/UX design?

12
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:37,122
UI design stands for user interface design.

13
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:40,182
UX design stands for user experience design.

14
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:46,112
Both elements are fundamental to a system's design, and they work hand in hand.

15
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,162
UI design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design,

16
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:52,152
though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex,

17
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:56,172
where UX design is a more analytical and technical design.

18
00:00:56,172 --> 00:01:00,152
Here's an example, skin versus mind and heart.

19
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:03,132
If you envision a product as the human body,

20
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:06,182
the bones signify the code which gives it structure.

21
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:11,092
The organs signify the UX design's supporting life functions.

22
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:13,887
And UI design represents the skin, the clothes,

23
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,152
the exterior presentation of the body.

24
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:19,122
Now everyone has heard of looks are only skin deep,

25
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,137
so in essence,

26
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:23,132
the UX design is much more important and critical

27
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,152
to a system than the UI design.

28
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,152
So here's a tip.

29
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:30,152
A great product outcome begins with designing the user experience,

30
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:33,122
and then it's followed by the user interface design.

31
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:38,142
Hence, ease of use has a greater emphasis.

32
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:42,092
Why use UI/UX design tools in the first place?

33
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:47,122
Well, they help elicit requirements and people can relate to visual artifacts,

34
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:51,112
such as screen or page layouts, rather than words on paper.

35
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,112
Help users know what they want, sort of.

36
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:58,142
UI/UX design is not the end all, but greatly helps you get there.

37
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:03,182
Usually UI/UX design artifacts are a major portion of the prototype outputs.

38
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:07,102
We will talk more about prototyping later in this module.

39
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:09,819
Since systems are really just a bunch of 1s and 0s,

40
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,152
product owners and customers love to see visual samples of what they might get.

41
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:19,309
UI/UX design is a process of visually guiding the user

42
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:22,152
through incremental and iterative experiences,

43
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:26,182
arriving at the worthiest design.

44
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:29,152
When to use UI/UX tools.

45
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:35,132
Whenever there is a visual or experience requirement, anywhere and anytime.

46
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:38,132
Usually this means web pages, desktop applications,

47
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:41,122
phone applications, numerical control applications.

48
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:46,102
So anything that a human will visually see and experience to get their job done.

49
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:47,122
Need I say more?

50
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:50,445
So you must always have some tools in your toolbelt to

51
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:55,122
perform UI and UX design experiences.

52
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:59,122
Here are some example of some UI/UX tools you may want to consider.

53
00:02:59,122 --> 00:02:59,532
Whiteboard.

54
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,172
Yes, it's old school,

55
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:05,129
but it's quick and easy and can get the basic UI/UX roughly

56
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,182
laid out for those ad hoc discussions.

57
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:11,162
Visio, or tools like it, allow easy workflow and screen mockups.

58
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,976
PowerPoint, again, quick and easy, low cost,

59
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:17,615
everyone typically has all these tools at their

60
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,182
disposal with no extra expenditures.

61
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:23,172
Now, here's a starting point of some of the more popular tools to check out.

62
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:27,152
But tools are constantly changing, so do some research online as well.

63
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:29,919
As you can see, InVision, Adobe, Origami,

64
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,412
Sketch, Axure, Webflow, Framer, Atomic, Principle,

65
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:38,102
Justinmind, Balsamiq Mockups, just to name a few.

66
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:41,182
This is just a representative list to get you started in the right direction.

67
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:41,468
Ultimately,

68
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:45,469
it all comes down to choosing the one or two that works best

69
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,172
for you and it's affordable for your company.

70
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:52,172
So you can get a quick visualization of what I'm talking about,

71
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,112
here's a screen mockup built in Balsamiq.

72
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:58,162
This and other tools do far more than just lay out a screen.

73
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:05,000
Check out the website of the tools I listed to get a good sense of their power and benefits.
