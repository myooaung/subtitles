00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:03.237
How business activities affect the gap.

2
00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:03.914
In this section,

3
00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:07.360
we will explore that the gap can vary in size based on the

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.984
kind of work you are performing and the size or level of

5
00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:15.207
effort that you are executing.

6
00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:19.167
I believe that all work that an organization must do can be

7
00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.247
divided or found of three main categories,

8
00:00:22.247 --> 00:00:26.257
operations, projects, initiatives.

9
00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:29.267
Now let's drill into each one.

10
00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:32.257
Now let's define and compare each work type.

11
00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:35.297
Operations are day-to-day functions of the business.

12
00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:38.267
Operational activities to keep the lights on.

13
00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.237
Like a utility company, you just expect it all to work.

14
00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:45.898
Issues or operational requests are typically tracked in a

15
00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:48.247
tracking system such as JIRA or others.

16
00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:54.297
Typically smaller units of work and always running sometimes even 7 by 24.

17
00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:57.297
Now to projects, they drive new revenues,

18
00:00:57.297 --> 00:01:01.227
they support existing or new products and services,

19
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.977
drive cost containment, management focus and attention,

20
00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:10.237
typically medium in level of effort, and they have a distinct beginning and end.

21
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:14.247
And then the outcome of those projects become part of operations.

22
00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:18.247
And lastly, to initiatives, they propel a company forward.

23
00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:20.217
They're strategic in nature.

24
00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:22.711
Major new products or services.

25
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:26.207
An executive focus rather than mid-management focus.

26
00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:31.227
Typically, very large activities in terms of resources, people, and money.

27
00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:34.257
Long-term strategic business outcomes.

28
00:01:34.257 --> 00:01:37.277
Now let's see some examples.

29
00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:40.982
I have chosen some very simplistic examples to further

30
00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.247
illustrate and contrast the work types.

31
00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:44.110
For operations,

32
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.297
a simple example may be enhance a user profile page

33
00:01:48.297 --> 00:01:50.297
for a healthcare enrollment system.

34
00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:53.277
This is a small activity, not too complex,

35
00:01:53.277 --> 00:01:57.207
requiring a low amount of business or technical knowledge.

36
00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:57.801
For projects,

37
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.679
a simple example may be add a new module to enable users to

38
00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.217
fill out healthcare applications online.

39
00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:08.272
This is a medium to possibly large activity requiring a

40
00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:11.829
medium to large business domain knowledge and

41
00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.237
significantly more technical knowledge.

42
00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:15.086
For initiatives,

43
00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:20.297
a simple example may be develop a new healthcare paperless application system.

44
00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:24.227
Okay, this is in the big leagues now, very large,

45
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:24.730
complex,

46
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.107
requiring a significantly large amount of business

47
00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:30.257
domain knowledge and technical knowledge.

48
00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:35.267
Yes, these are simple examples, but hopefully they convey a relative size,

49
00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:37.287
complexity, and level of effort.

50
00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:44.000
Speaking of level of effort, let's make sure we're on the same page on that term's definition.
