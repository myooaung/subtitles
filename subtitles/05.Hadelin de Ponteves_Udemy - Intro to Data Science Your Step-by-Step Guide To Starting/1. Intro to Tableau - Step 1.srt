00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,290
Hello and welcome to the part of the course on visualization.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,720
I hope you are enjoying intro to data science so far and in this part we're going to have quite an exciting

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,410
time.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,470
We're going to get some hands on experience with physical zation in order for us to get a better feel

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,610
for what it's like to be a data scientist and visualizing things and actually how much per hour that

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:35,060
can give to age in a sense the whole concept of Israel lising data or seeing your data how powerful

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,740
that is.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,800
And this part we're going to be using a tool called Tablo.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,110
I personally really like tabloid think it's very you are very user friendly and well-thought through

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,540
tool for zation and in fact they actually have a free version which called tabel public and that's why

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,380
we're going to use it here.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,190
So let's have a look to find tabel public.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,460
We're going to need to type in Tablo public.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,610
There it is.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:09,440
And that will open up the page if we can actually go and check out Tablo the Web site itself.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,140
So here you can see the Tabeau Web site.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,360
They talk about you know data in brilliance out.

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:22,130
It's quite a cool company in general they have a good division I think and also they have a very large

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,820
community so that's one of the powerful tools of type 1.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,750
One of the advantages of Tablo the community they have because you can always ask questions and people

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,360
can help you.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,250
So there's lots of things you can exploit as a gallery here if you'd like to see some examples.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,320
But for now just if you type in your e-mail here it will allow you to download that.

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:47,550
Now don't worry you don't have to give away your personal information you can type in a temporary email.

25
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,550
You you have or something else.

26
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,140
So for instance I've already downloaded it but I just wanted to see what it looks like I'll show you

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,770
what it looks like.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:02,770
Would say as I type in test 2:59 Visi test test test at gmail dot com.

29
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,910
Maybe add some symbols in case somebody has a me already.

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:16,100
So if you put in your information or some information you'll see that it's started downloading automatically.

31
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,050
They have a version for Windows and for Mac.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,950
So that's good.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,000
So once it's downloaded I'm just going to cancel this because I already have it.

34
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,450
Once it's on your computer and you launch it you'll get a screen like this.

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,970
And here you just continue the installation.

36
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,850
So I don't have it installed yet and doing this along together a few.

37
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,170
So let's have a look.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,310
There's always the license agreement so make sure you are aware of it and you agreed to it if you agreed

39
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,200
to it.

40
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,940
It tells you how much space will take and then it's going to ask you for your password.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,740
And as you can see it's installing now.

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,610
It lets you in a few seconds takes about a minute.

43
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,810
So while it's in storage sort of say that tabbouleh I've been using for quite a while now so probably

44
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,750
since 2000 12 was it.

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,900
Yeah they were both finished and I don't even have time telling or what.

46
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,910
So I was using Tablo I first learned about it at the word and I fell in love with that tool.

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,120
They're asking me to move to trash the installation file that's just how Macs work.

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,350
Yes.

49
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,740
Yeah and I think you will actually enjoy the two as well.

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,730
Once we get to know everybody here so tool is ready how do we how relaunch should we go.

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,150
Whoops trouble.

52
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,200
So I need tabel public not tablet desktop because I have no power at all.

53
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,110
And so if you search for Tabeau public on your Mac I pressed Connard comments space to bring up the

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,990
search menu.

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,750
And then you type in of public on Windows you will have it in the start menu.

56
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:02,410
So if you wanted to reach which screen is it going to launch on or away have to drag it or there is

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,890
less room.

58
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,670
Other screens.

59
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,240
I'll try to get over in a second.

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,710
So there it is there is tablet public and you're all successfully installed.

61
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,610
So we'll learn how to use the software.

62
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,410
And in fact we'll start using it from the next Toral.

63
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,040
And I look forward to seeing it.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,710
Until then enjoy the asides.
