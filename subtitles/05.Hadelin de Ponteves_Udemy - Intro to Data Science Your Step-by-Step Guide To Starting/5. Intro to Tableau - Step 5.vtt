Hello and welcome back to the intro today and of course I hope you enjoyed the previous tutorial and

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.640
slowly you're seeing how we go about this to solve this problem in a visual way.

3
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.290
And also I hope you had a chance to play around and you know maybe explore some other variables and

4
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.790
do some other things and.

5
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.080
And today is going to be a tutorial about Tablo itself because by now you've probably or you may have

6
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.320
tried to save your work right after this.

7
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.040
I always like to press like control apps on the windows or comment as on a Mac and to actually you know

8
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.700
like save my progress but if you press comment s in public what you get is this or let's just close

9
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.470
this window for now.

10
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.870
And if you go to File Save there's no save button there's no say button there's a save to go public

11
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.760
in the save to tabel public as.

12
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.020
So what is this all about.

13
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.460
Well the reason for this is that Tatel public it's a free version of the software and it comes with

14
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.920
certain limitations and one of those limitations is that you cannot save the file to your desktop began

15
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.860
to save your work on your own computer.

16
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.030
And that's fair enough because it's an amazing software and they obviously need to somehow fund their

17
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.980
research and development in order to progress so that comes from people who pay for the public this

18
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.980
power tablet desktop version and in the public what they do provide is an option to save your work publicly

19
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.890
and that means you will save it on their server.

20
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.570
But everybody in the world will be able to access it and that's it.

21
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.420
So basically try and avoid using Tabeau public for sensitive data and for work related data but for

22
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.100
practice you can always use it.

23
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.150
So there's no problem with that.

24
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.210
So in order to save your work you click Save Tablo public you need to create an account.

25
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.150
You put it like you created here you log in or you can just click Create one for free you'd put in your

26
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.630
credentials here.

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.040
Check the terms of service and create your profile.

28
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.850
And so I just wanted to show you what it would look like to have an account.

29
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.950
So if we go to Google and we go to Tablo book

30
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.670
and we open it up here.

31
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.320
So there are several public.

32
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.800
And if you go to at the top if you go to Galerie you'll see everybody else's there's elections like

33
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.270
you know the popular ones go visit the day and things like that.

34
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.420
There's lots of realisations that people are actually building and you can explore them and you know

35
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.950
comment on them and see what other people are doing and these are all the things that are possible to

36
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.750
tackle.

37
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.880
I want to also show you my profile here just to demonstrate how this whole thing works so Carol

38
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.880
Inco to

39
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.160
give it a second so if you scroll down.

40
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.610
These are actually these submissions you'll see this like 280.

41
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.410
That's because I'm very grateful for this.

42
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.920
By the way like a lot of students from the other courses are uploading their work and tagging me in

43
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.390
it.

44
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.320
But if you go to my profile you'll see that I also profile and I have uploaded some project of my own.

45
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.580
So basically what I want to show you is that there is nothing like bad about having your data available

46
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.940
available publicly as long as it's not sensitive personal data or private information or work related

47
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.690
data.

48
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.410
As always it's practice projects like we're doing now.

49
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.290
Like I encourage students to upload the projects here to share and to you know show their friends and

50
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.730
colleagues and you know like maybe family or get feedback from others so here you can see like one of

51
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.630
the other one of those examples from from one of our other courses where we're doing some more advanced

52
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.780
analytics or building and dashboard and things like that.

53
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.260
So yeah that's just a quick note on Tablo public so don't be worried if you do want to save.

54
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.760
There's nothing wrong with your machine or if your version of tabel that's just how it works.

55
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.780
If you do want to proceed then feel free to create an account and you can save your work.

56
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.920
But otherwise even if you don't it's OK as well because you can just keep it open until we get to the

57
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.860
end of the section.

58
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.820
There's only a couple tutorials left.

59
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.270
And then when you do the next project you can just start in your new dashboard or a new tablet workbook.

60
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.870
So there you go.

61
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.350
That's how the Tumblr public works.

62
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.780
And we'll continue analyzing this on the next tutorial if you haven't played around yet.

63
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.460
Then I encourage you to do that.

64
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.250
You know check out a couple of other variables.

65
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.350
You know what happens if you look at I don't know like education or day of the week and things like

66
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.160
that and then we'll do it together next trial over there.

67
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.300
And until next that enjoy sense.
