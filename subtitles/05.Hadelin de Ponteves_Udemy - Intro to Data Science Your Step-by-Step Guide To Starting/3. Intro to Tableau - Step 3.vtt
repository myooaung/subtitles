00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.530
Hello welcome back to the intro Today science course.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm very excited about today because I just realized that for some of you this might be the very first

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.050
time you're solving a design challenge because love is going to show you how to solve some challenges

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.360
in a private journal but this one is actually coming before the Python tutorials.

5
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.200
So that's super cool like congratulations if this is indeed the first time you're selling a disguise

6
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.480
problem.

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.180
OK.

8
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.390
So it is for the sake fool for that purpose exactly that.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.960
Maybe it's your first time.

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.450
And we had to explain exactly what we're doing.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.840
And you'll notice when you do the Python internals you notice a lot of resemblance in the problem itself

12
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.010
with what Adlon is going to be talking about.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810
But the way we're going to approach it is going to be very different.

14
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.680
So let's go to this part.

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.570
So here I'm just going to use this file to talk about what we're doing.

16
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.890
Let's do an answer here or there.

17
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.310
So this variable I'm going to highlight in yellow.

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.880
And then let's you know let's highlighted in red like this one in red.

19
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.270
And all of these other ones in green and that will always help us remember which was which.

20
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.230
All right so at the start we've got some input variables.

21
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.050
These are variables that we know about our customers their age their job their marital status their

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.870
education have they ever had a default or do they have created in default Do they have a housing loan.

23
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:53.640
Do they have a personal loan then some information relating to how we run our current how we were how

24
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.680
we lost contact them on this current campaign.

25
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.690
You know the contact time was that a salary like a mobile phone or a telephone or a landline.

26
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.760
What month was the last contact was it January February or December day of the week.

27
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.030
Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday.

28
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.230
That was it was it Friday duration.

29
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.200
How long was the duration of a call.

30
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.390
By the way it is a note to not to use this variable because it's very highly correlated with the output

31
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.100
so it's kind of like cheating if we use it so we're not going to use it.

32
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.350
Then other attributes campaign.

33
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.990
Number of contacts before during this campaign days like period means a number of days passed by the

34
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.630
bye passed by after the client was contacted from a previous campaign.

35
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.600
So they see how many days passed before since we got lost about a different campaign previous number

36
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.970
of context performed before this campaign ad for this clients.

37
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.180
The outcome outcome of the previous marketing campaign and then some social economic context variables

38
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.170
which are good we you want to worried about employment very rate consumer price index and so on.

39
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.870
So these are all things that you can imagine these are all the things we know or we can easily know

40
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.820
at any point in time like if tomorrow we start working with we pick another client.

41
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.870
That's not that's not in this list of forty eight thousand or whatever number we had.

42
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.200
If we pick a calm client to start in this list then very easily we can find out these things we can

43
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.950
just look at the information on file and you know like that we have about our customer or about in our

44
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.370
interactions of Wisconsin.

45
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.050
The question is can we predict based on this green information can we predict if the client will subscribe

46
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.010
to a term deposit.

47
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.200
To what exactly.

48
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.880
Our campaign is all about.

49
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.140
We want to sell them a term deposit.

50
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.480
That's our goal.

51
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.950
That's the goal of the bank and we want to you know obviously we want to approach customers that are

52
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.370
most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

53
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.570
Right so even like why would we spend our marketing budget and why would we spend the time or our employees

54
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.930
on you know contacting people who are not likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

55
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.390
So.

56
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.290
So the whole the way this data assigns problem works so the challenge is structured is knowing what

57
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.730
we know about our customers right now about all 48000 rows about 40000 people.

58
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.680
Knowing what we know like all of this information from each year from the second last column to the

59
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.440
left so these are all the green columns right.

60
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.630
So let's just highlight a bit more like that.

61
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.960
So knowing all of these green columns is there a way we can do this section.

62
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.390
So knowing these green columns is there a way we can predict what the white column is so and this and

63
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.190
this data that exists already we know this column.

64
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.450
Right.

65
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.450
We know the results.

66
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.910
So this is like training data because in this data we know what happened.

67
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.930
We know in reality this this person didn't subscribe.

68
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.920
This person did.

69
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.150
But this person did.

70
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.380
So it's like in real life you you have all of these iterations like you have all of these examples from

71
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.220
which you can learn and you can maybe learn that people that let's see what is there like what why why

72
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.480
is this person special why did they.

73
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.510
Maybe because they are you know maybe it's that age that affected their decisions.

74
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.870
Right.

75
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.430
Like maybe you will see that age is correlated with people taking up a term deposit.

76
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.620
Maybe it's that they're an entrepreneur or maybe it's that they're married.

77
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.460
Maybe it's that we can't see them by.

78
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.550
But doesn't really look like it looks like you know a lot of people who were contacted by telephone

79
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.510
didn't subscribe.

80
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.180
Maybe.

81
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.920
All duration of the cold we've already been told that it's highly correlated so we're not going to use

82
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.220
it.

83
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.170
It was the day of the week.

84
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.600
Maybe if we call it on Monday they are more likely to buy the term deposit or get the term deposit.

85
00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.290
Whatever everybody is the point is that we can use this existing data to better make better decisions

86
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.870
in the future.

87
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.390
And that's what data science is all about.

88
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:11.530
So if we have all this data for I think this data was collected 2008 to 2012 four thousand six 2012

89
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.340
you know like for quite quite a few years for like four years or something like that.

90
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:23.570
So if we have this data for us for a certain period of time why isn't is actually an asset is an asset

91
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:31.130
to the company and the purpose of a data scientist is to realize how to use that asset how to use that

92
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:38.420
information turn it into insights to drive decisions in the future to drive better smarter or wiser

93
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.290
decisions that will save money save costs and improve efficiency.

94
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.000
And that's exactly what we're going to be doing.

95
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.850
So we're going to be using these green Marable's to understand which ones of them are correlated with

96
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.080
the spread variable.

97
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.800
So in the future we can be we can just make decisions like that.

98
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.070
For instance we might say the best people to contact are entrepreneurs.

99
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.970
We're going to contact them first and then we're going to contact everybody who has a housing loan.

100
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.510
And there we.

101
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.560
And at the same time we're only going to call them on a Monday because that's the best way to do it.

102
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.270
And if we give that those insights to the operations department or to the CEO they're going to save

103
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.230
a lot of money because they need to contact another 10000 people this year.

104
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.040
So that's what we're going to be doing.

105
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.200
And I know you were probably excited about visualizing starting to visualize right away.

106
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.540
We will jump into visualization and equitorial.

107
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.640
I actually just realized as I was recording this that it's better to first explain the problem because

108
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.710
this is probably for for many it might be the first time you're doing a design problem.

109
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.710
And we'll get to it.

110
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.000
Promise we'll get to it in the next.

111
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.380
So I'll see you there and we'll start visualizing right away.

112
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.150
And until then enjoy data Davison's.
