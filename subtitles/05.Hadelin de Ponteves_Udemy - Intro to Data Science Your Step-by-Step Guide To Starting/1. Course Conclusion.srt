00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,250
The Welcome back to the interest science course as we get our final tutorial the course conclusion.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,830
So let's have a look at what we covered off the scores.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,790
Here's is step by step process to getting into data science in 42 days.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,420
And I really hope that after taking this course you know feel that it is possible that you can become

5
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,150
a data scientist and starting an aspiring data scientist just in six weeks.

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,620
And now let's quickly go through the topics that occurred.

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,490
Just to reiterate the things that we discussed about each one.

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,770
So throughout these tutorials we got a feel for all of these components.

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,490
We talked about statistics and the important elements of statistics that you need to get started.

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,680
And it's to say that you don't need to study any other statistics ever but you can just look at the

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,300
ones that we outlined the eight or the three the three core components three absolutely necessary components

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,740
that will help you avoid costly mistakes so the why behind this one is to help avoid mistakes that might

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,630
be associated with statistical significance and other interpretations of results.

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,410
And then as you go along in your career you can always Druim stay a little bit of statistics here and

15
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,280
there or pick up a few more concepts along the way maybe even the longest journey or off to the footy

16
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,390
today but you need to start off with those first three things at least that much then.

17
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,710
Then we had to look at the learn the data science process.

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,440
So we talked about what it's what it is and what are the five stages and that gave us a good overview

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,100
of what we'll be doing in their designs and that hopefully that helped see how all of these other components

20
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,310
fit into the bigger picture of a data science process.

21
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,190
So here we've got our own kind of process of learning but the data science processes the process you'll

22
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,960
be applying on pretty much any data science project that you'll be working on.

23
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,770
And that's why it was important to cover it off or then we touched on viz. that there's two types of

24
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,550
insulation.

25
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,130
There's a zation for data mining and viz. for presentation.

26
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:31,620
And here we allocate 10 days to this component because it is so powerful as you can see from this these

27
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,810
this case that you like and later further down in the course in section 2 we had a case study of isolation

28
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,840
for data mining and re-assessed customers of the bank and the likelihood take a product.

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,530
So from that case that you could see how powerful Weasel's issue can be already on its own and that's

30
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,460
why we're looking at 10 days so you have enough time to really get good at it and then be able to perform

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,780
simple data science projects and so here we actually have a checkpoint attempt your first science project

32
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:13,380
and that's exactly what was suggested so that you basically in those 10 days find some time to tend

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:21,120
to first date a science project and see how you go and actually spend a couple of days or some time

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,620
within a couple of days to perform that project to see what power results zation actually gives to you.

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,830
Then we talked about databases and that they are important in order to get access to more data to get

36
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,420
access to more information and you'll be able to analyze and replicate in five days here because it

37
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,710
is quite important and yet it's not that difficult to get grasp of a one of the four main rescue well

38
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,420
type databases and so you can pick one of your choosing one of your liking maybe it's the one that is

39
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,250
used at work.

40
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,610
Maybe it's the one that you prefer and then you can just jump into it learn how to use a database management

41
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,340
system that should probably take about five days.

42
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,750
That's how I think that's how long it took me to get into that world when I was just starting out.

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,980
Of course you as with all of these you will continue in increasing your knowledge as you go ahead further

44
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,350
down the track but just to get started.

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,940
How did you get up there and talked about statistical learning and I'd gave you his two favorite books

46
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,870
on the topic and that was his way of starting into data science.

47
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,840
It's an important steps step.

48
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,980
However we're allocating only two days to school learning because we don't want you to get carried away

49
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:41,220
is very easy to get either too excited about the world of learning or bogged down in it and either extreme

50
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,340
is not good because it is extreme and an extreme.

51
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:54,750
The best way is to just pick at least one type of algorithm that you want to really get to know quite

52
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,450
well and spend those two days learning it.

53
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,450
And so just based on that one example you'll understand what the statistical learning concepts behind

54
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,240
a machine learning algorithm and then it will be easier to pick up in your algorithm if you like or

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,850
you can spend the two days just reading the overuse of different statistical learning approaches and

56
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,890
that will often be good just so basically those two days should be enough to get an intro into the subject

57
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,580
so that if you ever need to pick it up and deep dive further you're already a bit more comfortable with

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,870
this whole area.

59
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,380
And then we dive into probably the biggest component 12 days as you can see that's out of all the days

60
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:42,840
6 7 5 to 12 to we've got 12 days for mission learning and that is because Machine learning is the new

61
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,390
data size or a lot of people might consider that of course there are other types of their science as

62
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,650
we can see with whistles.

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,550
And that's one of the reasons why we included this is Alsation for data mining because just to show

64
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,430
you that even if you are completely not comfortable machine learning or coding or you think that you

65
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:10,020
can still be successful with simply visualization techniques but nevertheless machine learning is indeed

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,910
empowering data scientists all around the world it is a very strong component in the data science skill

67
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,290
set and that's why I'm really counting 12 days so that you can go through and learn.

68
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,090
You don't have to learn all of the machine learning is very broad there's lots of algorithms.

69
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:34,110
But if you learn even some of the basic classification clustering regression techniques maybe some reinforcement

70
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,690
learning or some association learning.

71
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,610
If you look at that even the basics techniques in those 12 days and you learn and you get to practice

72
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,440
with four or five or six different algorithms for instance Spenny to algorithm two days per hour that

73
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:56,130
should be a great overview of the subject and in fact in this course we already give you two algorithms

74
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,600
so Adlon walked the walk you through two different algorithms.

75
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:09,240
In his practical examples with Python that hopefully showed you how easy it is to apply machine learning.

76
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,340
And so in those 12 days we suggest another check point to attempt and advanced data science project

77
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,230
and now by this point you already know some statistics zation databases that mystical learning and machine

78
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,960
learning and that should be sufficient to take on a more advanced science project.

79
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:37,260
Something almost as at the level of Kaggle or maybe at the level of Kaggle introductory type of projects

80
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,100
and of course you can find other sources for projects as well.

81
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,660
Then after that after those 12 days the next step is to learn more Python.

82
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:53,000
And the reason behind this the why behind this is to speed up your data science.

83
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,960
Your application of data set so you can apply machine learning in Python even if not knowing Python

84
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,360
as you could see you can just use templates or just so like lines of code.

85
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,200
It's kind of like building blocks out of Lego.

86
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:11,790
Whereas if you actually learn more Python that should take approximately five days to get a good grasp

87
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,390
of it understand the basics of functions variables and things like that.

88
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:21,420
If you learn that then your application of machine learning will become much more C and you will feel

89
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,020
like a fish in the water when you're flying these machine learning techniques in Python or spider or

90
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,460
Jupiter notebooks or wherever you are playing these machine learning algorithms.

91
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,100
And finally at the end of allocated two days to deep learning and that's to give you a general overview

92
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,880
of what people are doing is in this course we did the show showcased deep learning we showcased deep

93
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,370
learning with a natural language processing we're deploying computer vision people are as you can see

94
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,090
and it has potential if you spend a couple more days on deep learning even though you all probably won't

95
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,930
be ready to apply deep learning to challenge the problems you'll at least know in which direction to

96
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,550
think and when those challenges come up.

97
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:13,050
You'll be able to dig further and understand which deep learning algorithms apply and how to apply them

98
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,900
on the job already and your knowledge of machine learning will really help you out because the whole

99
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,560
concept of applying deep learning as just as building blocks as Lego bricks is very similar.

100
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,090
So you can just write a few lines of code and you can see how it can volitional kneeler neural networks

101
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,410
set up or artificial neural networks set up just for that analysis of your problem.

102
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,940
So there we go that's how we get to the final stage to day 42.

103
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,630
In data science and day 42 you are ready.

104
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,190
Conrads you made it.

105
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,370
If you get there then you can really set out.

106
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,760
You go and start looking at Kaggle competitions.

107
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:03,910
Set up your own upward profile and say that your day or your starting date assigns then bid for jobs.

108
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,520
Work or you can start approaching your first client and see how you can help them there.

109
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,550
So there you go.

110
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,710
All in all it takes 42 days if you're excited about this journey.

111
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,430
As excited as you are then we challenge you to take it on and see where you can get the steps.

112
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,240
There are lots of materials we offer lots of courses if you're ever interested.

113
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,640
We welcome you to check them out.

114
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,390
But that's not to say that there aren't other materials as lots of other online courses that you can

115
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,610
take what books that you can read.

116
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,780
You can watch YouTube videos.

117
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:46,380
There's tons of materials online where you can find all of this knowledge and hopefully this road map

118
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:53,280
to becoming a dangerous scientist will guide you and you will know what to learn what steps and checkpoints

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,510
to take and how much time is spent on each one.

120
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:03,870
Try to try to practice some rigorous self-control so that you don't get carried away spending too much

121
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,330
time.

122
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,910
But also when you know that you only have let's say five days to study databases then that should keep

123
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,400
but keep pushing you so that you don't let yourself stop and you know maybe take two or three weeks

124
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,550
on the subject when it's only you only need actually 5 days to cover it all.

125
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,280
So there we go.

126
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,950
Hopefully this will help you out.

127
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,860
And we're routing for you.

128
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,190
We're cheering for you.

129
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,890
We can't wait to see you among the ranks of the scientists.

130
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,380
Thank you so much for taking this course and we'll see you next.

131
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,380
Until then enjoy datasets.
