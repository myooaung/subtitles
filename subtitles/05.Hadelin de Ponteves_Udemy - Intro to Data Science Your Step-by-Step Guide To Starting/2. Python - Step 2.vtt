00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:11.440
Hello and welcome to this new section fully about bison in this section we're going to do our very first

2
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.460
steps in Python and Dyster toil.

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.100
We're going to start by of course getting by and getting the knock on the environment which I highly

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.090
recommend to start with because it basically contains all the libraries and packages you will need to

5
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.280
build some powerful machine learning models or data science models.

6
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.720
So that's definitely my best recommendation to start programming in Python.

7
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.790
And here we go.

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.180
That's why right now I'm on google.

9
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.440
Our starting point for Python.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.480
So let's do this as I just said the first thing we're going to do is download this what we call a needy

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.980
which is Anaconda.

12
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.390
So an icon is built this way and can that just like the snake.

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.210
And here you take the first link Anaconda count because on this link you will find this download an

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.970
icon the Suddenlink which is the way to download an icon.

15
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.590
Then you need to choose your system here.

16
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.030
Windows Mac OS or Linux.

17
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.890
I'm on my quest so it automatically found my system and then you're going to download bising 3.6 and

18
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.010
not not and 2.7 because bison 3.6 is more advanced with some more features.

19
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.370
So just click on download here and it will start downloading and it kinda just sitting here and there

20
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.900
and it takes depending on your internet.

21
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.690
A couple of minutes.

22
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.400
All right so I'm just going to fast forward here until the download is finished and I'll see you at

23
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.760
Dnt.

24
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.930
And welcome back.

25
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.310
The download is finished.

26
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.920
Now we're ready to install an icon.

27
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.660
So let's go to our download folder or wherever and I can download downloaded on your system.

28
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.130
Let's find the installation foul.

29
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.210
That's double click on it and it will launch the attack on that installation.

30
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.900
Here you click on continue.

31
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.910
And then just continue continue continue you can read if you want and then agree and let's do it let's

32
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.170
install Anaconda.

33
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.680
Now the installation is on its way.

34
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.070
Again it's going to take some couple of minutes.

35
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.440
So I'll see you at.

36
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.120
All right.

37
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.880
Amazing.

38
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.040
Most of the installation is done.

39
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.720
Now here you have the option to install Microsoft vs code.

40
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.120
That's not necessary so you don't have to install it just press continues here and there we go.

41
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.570
We have an icon that installed on our machine here you can just choose to keep the installation file

42
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.260
or just move it to the trash.

43
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.400
I'm going to keep it.

44
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.620
We never know.

45
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.150
All right.

46
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.550
And now we have an idea but we're not going to launch and I can die right now before this we are going

47
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.590
to go to our desktop and create a new folder which is going to be the main folder of this course which

48
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
will contain you know all the python files we will implement.

49
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.350
They're actually going to be too.

50
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.960
But for these two files we will have a separate working directory folders because indeed when you work

51
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.720
in Python it's always good to work in a specific folder which we called a working directory folder.

52
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.860
Why is that.

53
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.300
It's because most of the time when you work on Python you work on a data set the data set that contains

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.830
the data on which you build your data science or machinery model.

55
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.650
And this data set has to be in this working directory folder.

56
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.200
When you know you import it or call it to feed your machinery model and that's why right now not only

57
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.300
we're going to create the main form of the course which we're going to call introduction to data science

58
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.480
or whatever name you want.

59
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.490
But inside is full though we're going to create these two separate working directory folders one for

60
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.450
regression and one for classification because indeed in this python introduction section we will solve

61
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.960
two problems the main data science problems which are regression and classification.

62
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.140
So we're going to make one separate working directory folder for regression and one other separate folder

63
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.160
for classification.

64
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:29.650
So let's do this right now let's start with the main folder which as we said we call introduction to

65
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.890
date a science writer that's demand fuller.

66
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:46.440
And inside this folder we create two separate folder one for regression and one other for classification

67
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.710
and there we go.

68
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.990
And so in these two folders we're going to have separate days of course because the problems to solve

69
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.950
will be different.

70
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.290
You will see which problems there will be in this section I can already tell you that there will be

71
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.680
one problem related to energy and one other problem related to health.

72
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.770
So we will tackle these two very different problems.

73
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.590
One will be a regression problem and the other one will be a classification problem.

74
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.320
By the way my apologies for those of you who don't know what regression and classification are regression

75
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.720
is when you have to predict continuous real number and classification is when you have to predict a

76
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.700
class or a category.

77
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.390
So for example regression can be predicting a salary or a temperature or any continuous measure and

78
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.750
classification is for example predicting the winner of a soccer game or the Super Bowl or even the president

79
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.960
of the United States.

80
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.280
So make sure you understand these two problems that we will tackle in the section.

81
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.570
And these are basically the main types of problem you encounter in data science and what we'll have

82
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.200
is in each folder we'll have a separate dataset one data set here for the regression folder and one

83
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.190
other data set here in the classification folder and same will create two separate bytes and files one

84
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.580
python file here which will be the classification model will implement in the same classification folder

85
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.630
that contains this data set for classification and one separate byte and file here which will contain

86
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.590
our regression model in the same folder that contains the data set for regression.

87
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.450
All right so that's the first thing you need to do before we launch.

88
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.110
And I can do that.

89
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.480
And once that's done there you go congratulations you're ready to start your very first steps in Anaconda

90
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.710
and therefore in Python.

91
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.360
And so to launch an icon that depending on your system there's several ways I'm going to start with

92
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.520
Windows users for Windows users you just need to go at the bottom left corner.

93
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:55.310
Click on this Windows button here then look at your list of programs and find Anaconda.

94
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.860
And there you will find the Anaconda navigator launch button.

95
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:06.220
Just click on it and this will launch an icon there for Linux users you will find very easily Anaconda

96
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.490
and your list of programs and eventually for Mac users you have two ways of launching an icon that you

97
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.130
can find it in the applications.

98
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.900
There it is.

99
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.650
On the navigator but that's not what I do.

100
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.210
I always use a shortcut.

101
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.650
See M.D the command key plus space that I type and Khanda navigator.

102
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.510
There it is.

103
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.100
I just press enter and there we go.

104
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:39.260
This launches Anaconda so initialising adding features loading applications loading content.

105
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.210
And there we go.

106
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.490
Welcome to Anaconda.

107
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:50.690
So as you can see Anaconda is a navigator that contains several IDs and IDs basically an interface in

108
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.660
which you can code some Python implementations.

109
00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:01.790
Recently our studio was added to add a Condesa that you can directly install are to do with our from

110
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.570
Anaconda.

111
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:10.790
But originally it only contained some Python development environments and the two that I highly recommend

112
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.530
if you want to experiment here are Jupiter notebook which is an amazing ID on which you can also code

113
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.770
in that take you know to add some mathematics equations.

114
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:27.740
It's great if you want to write a research paper that includes some code and the other one that I highly

115
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:34.190
recommend and that is actually my favorite a spider spider is great because it's like a studio a very

116
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:41.480
user friendly studio to code in Python and that's by far what I recommend to start coding in Python.

117
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.860
And besides besides this user friendly advantage Well it's a powerful Python ID with advanced editing

118
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.820
interactive testing debugging and introspection features.

119
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.360
So let's have a look at this and let's see what it looks like.

120
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.500
So Spierer is launching here it is connecting to kernel.

121
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:10.480
And as I just said it really looks like a studio because here this is the editor window inside which

122
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.910
you know we will write the code that will execute in the end.

123
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:22.870
Here you have another window that includes file explore which contains basically all the files on your

124
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.350
computer.

125
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:29.600
And right now of course we're going to find our desktop folder to find our introduction to Davison's

126
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.740
folder which we've just created.

127
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.850
I'm going to stay here for now because we haven't started any regression or classification that will

128
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:43.870
be in the next tutorial but there we go you have flics floor here to find your working directory folder

129
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.990
which I remind is very important to create because this is the folder that will not only contain data

130
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:55.110
set that will feed your model but also your Python model.

131
00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.160
Then you have variable Explorer which will contain all the variables you create in your implementation

132
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:09.130
and also you have help window which will give you a lot of relevant information and descriptive informations

133
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.800
of the different objects you use or functions or classes.

134
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.410
Basically all the machine learning tools will see that more in details once we start the implementations

135
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.310
and then here you have the console.

136
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.740
And basically that's where the code will be executed.

137
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:33.730
You know once we execute the code it will appear here and run here but apart from the code you can already

138
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.420
write some comments here.

139
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.940
For example you can just type here two plus two just press enter and the output is four.

140
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:48.100
You know you can add some calculous can even make it function but this is not where you write the code

141
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.560
to implement your model.

142
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:50.930
This is actually right here.

143
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:57.540
And the very important thing you must do here is totally ignore this temp drop your wife.

144
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.070
This is not the path and file in which we will implement our morals.

145
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:08.080
So what we're gonna do now is click on file here then our new file and then we were going to delete

146
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.120
this turned up your wife felt this was just a temporary file.

147
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.270
There is not much useful and that is just here before you start implementing your pipes and fell and

148
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.310
that is this one.

149
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.510
So what we're going to do now is first select everything and delete because we won't need this.

150
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.770
We're now going to give a title to this file.

151
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:32.230
And since we're going to start with regression in the next Statoil Well we're going to give it the title

152
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:38.500
regression and to give a title in person well you need to make it as a comment because you don't want

153
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:44.800
this title to be executed you know in the console and to make comment in Python you need to start with

154
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.350
a hash tag here at the beginning of the line of code and then you can add the title you want.

155
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:57.210
And so since we start with regression the title of this python file of our very first bite and file

156
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.370
Congratulations again is going to be regression.

157
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.360
And now we're going to save this byte and file indirect for there.

158
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.320
That is the working directory folder and that will contain the data set which will get of course in

159
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.730
the next Statoil.

160
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.720
So let's find this folder we created it just before it's in our main folder.

161
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.660
Introduction to data science and then regression.

162
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.030
All right.

163
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.770
