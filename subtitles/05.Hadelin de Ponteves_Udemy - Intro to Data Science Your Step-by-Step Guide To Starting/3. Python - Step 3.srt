00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,700
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,620
All right so we're going to start tackling our regression problem and to do this.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,700
Our starting point is to get the data set to define the problem.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:23,290
And this will be the opportunity for me to show you a great repertory to practice their science and

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,180
machine learning on the Internet which is the U.S. I am now.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,340
Repository there is of course the Kaggle website that contains a lot of data sets and challenges.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,720
But since these are your first steps in data science I think this is too soon.

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:44,500
And I rather recommend starting with the U.S. and a repository and so on Google you just need to type

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:44,870
here.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,960
You see an L respiratory.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,370
And here we go UCI machinery Repp is the first link.

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,650
Let's go inside.

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:02,550
And now we're going to go to view all datasets and you will see that you will find real world data sets

14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,280
grouped into the diverse data assigned tasks.

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:12,100
And remember I told you in the previous tutorial that there was main types of data science problems.

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,190
The first one was regression which is the one we will start in this bison section and the second one

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,740
is classification.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,420
Then you also have clustering.

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,860
But this is slightly more advanced.

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,680
This belongs to the unsupervised machine learning branch which is the situation where you actually don't

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,450
know what to predict.

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,610
That is you don't have a dependent variable that you would like to predict and therefore the challenge

23
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,510
here is more to identify some segments some what we call clusters which you have absolutely no idea

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,430
what they will be.

25
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,220
But the machine learning algorithm will find them for you.

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,920
But this is slightly more advanced and if you're interested in that data assigned task well feel free

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,100
to check out our machine or in course we have a full part with two full sections on clustering and we

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,370
implement two models.

29
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,360
Kamins and hierarchical clustering.

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,470
But here we are just going to tackle the first two Davison's problems which are already representing

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,190
a huge part of their science.

32
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,030
And these are classification and regression.

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:23,170
So let's start with regression and therefore let's click on regression here to have all the regression

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,760
problems.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,670
And of course the data sets.

36
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,050
And so you can practice on lots of data sets with various data science problems and challenges.

37
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,770
I'm particularly interested in two industries today.

38
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,760
The energy industry and the health industry.

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,790
So for this course I thought of tackling two problems one that belongs to the energy industry and one

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,780
other that belongs to the health industry.

41
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,250
And so for regression we're going to tackle an energy related challenge and for classification This

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,310
will be a health challenge and you have many energy related challenges here.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,330
But the one we're going to tackle will be this one the combined cycle power plant in which you will

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:13,810
see we will have to predict continuous outcome because remember regression is about predicting a continuous

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,660
outcome which you will see will be so i'm just clicking on this combined cycle power plant data set

46
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,700
will be the net how the electrical energy output.

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,470
Basically we have to predict how the electrical energy output of some power plants more precisely some

48
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,800
combined cycle power plant.

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,530
And that's the first thing you need to catch.

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,610
What exactly do we have to predict.

51
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,730
We have to predict the net how the electrical energy output and then the question is how are we going

52
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,870
to predict it with which independent variables are we going to predict this next.

53
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,140
Ali electrical energy output.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:00,940
Well as we see in the description of this dataset one of the cell is the number of attributes and there

55
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,360
are four of them and these attributes are exactly the independent variables from which we are going

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,120
to predict this electrical energy output.

57
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,620
And by the way what we have to predict is called the dependent variable.

58
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,300
So basically to recap we are going to predict the dependent variable.

59
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,100
Thanks to our independent variables.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,620
And so now let's see what they are.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,690
Let's see what these independent variables are.

62
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,290
The first of them is the temperature the temperature going in the range one point eighty one degrees

63
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,730
Celsius up to thirty seven point eleven degrees Celsius.

64
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,950
Then the second attribute the second independent variable or even the second feature we can also call

65
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,300
it this way is the ambient pressure.

66
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,680
Of course this could be indeed a significant variable that would have a predictive power on the dependent

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,180
variable which is the energy.

68
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:59,920
So ambient pressure going in this range then the humidity of course that could also be a factor impacting

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
the energy.

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,370
Then the exhaust vacuum another variable that could have an impact.

71
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,510
And with these four variables which I remind are called the independent variables we predict the dependent

72
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,970
variable which is the net how the electrical energy outputs.

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,900
All right.

74
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:27,130
So a typical regression problem with very few features but nowhere is the model we will implement can

75
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:34,630
also be applied to any other data set whether you have four features or 1000 features by not changing

76
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,500
anything.

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,200
Just make sure that the independent variables of this data set are also continuous independent variables

78
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,690
because we won't have to deal with any categorical variable.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,710
But if that's the case well you will be able to apply the model we will implement in this section to

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,330
any other data set.

81
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,050
All right.

82
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,350
Perfect So now that we understand the problem let's download the data set and let's start tackling the

83
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,400
challenge.

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,520
So to download the data set as you can see there is this download link here.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,090
You have to do set description here and the data folder we are interested in the data folder because

86
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,460
that's where we'll find the dataset.

87
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,500
And here it is.

88
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,210
That's this zip folder CCP the combined cycle power plant that zip.

89
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,090
Let's click on this and to download a starting I'll show you here it is.

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,680
And it takes a few seconds this time and perfect we have it.

91
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,140
Let's go now to our download fooler because that's where it is.

92
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,930
Download it.

93
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,850
Here it is.

94
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,230
Let's double click on it to unzip it.

95
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,810
Let's open the folder.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,520
And as you can see we have several files so the first one is some readonly file which you can open to

97
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,180
have some more information.

98
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,260
Yes indeed it contains basically the information of the challenge and the data set.

99
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,350
And by the way I'd like to give the credit to the author who made this amazing data set to practice.

100
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,070
Here it is.

101
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,070
You can find it in the read me file.

102
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,320
So let's close this because what we're interested in is of course the data set.

103
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,910
We have it in two formats O.D. as or Excel.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,010
And we will take the excellent.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,360
So I'm going to copy it.

106
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,550
We're going to go to our desktop folder interaction data science.

107
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,210
And because remember we have to put these data sets in the working directory folder in which we already

108
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,870
saved we already created our regression python file which will contain the whole implementation of our

109
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,820
regression.

110
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,960
So let's paste that here.

111
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,710
Here we go the dataset is ready and now finally let's go back to Python to start smashing this challenge.

112
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,230
So what do we need to start with.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,880
Well first of all there is a very important thing to start with before implementing anything.

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,970
This is to be in the working directory for.

115
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,770
So the first thing we have to do here is go to the directory folder which is of course this folder the

116
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,070
regression folder.

117
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,080
So let's go inside.

118
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,980
And here we go.

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,660
We are inside the right field.

120
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,820
Now that's the only thing you need to do.

121
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,230
There is no button to activate a working directory folder like in the previous versions.

122
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:18,290
You just need to be in that folder and you're automatically connected to all the files inside the folder

123
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,930
and there are two of them.

124
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,180
The regression bytes and.

125
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:27,070
Which is this one in which we've just created in the toil and of course our dataset.

126
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,540
So we're going to start the implementation in the next Statoil.

127
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,470
But just before I'd like to show you how you can open a dataset directly from File Explorer by just

128
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,830
clicking on it right here and here is what we get.

129
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:47,210
As you can see it contains the data with the four attributes which remember are the ambient temperature.

130
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,930
The vacuum feature the ambient pressure and the humidity.

131
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,470
So these four attributes are independent variables.

132
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,020
And with these four independent variables we're going to predict this dependent variable which is the

133
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,950
energy.

134
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,500
All right so that's the first way of looking at the data set here as you can see it automatically opened

135
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,400
Excel.

136
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,450
So I'm going to close this.

137
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,800
Now here we are ready for the implementation which will start in the next two.

138
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,590
Until then enjoy the designs.
