1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,930
Come back to the course on data science.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,080
Your intro Today is the ultimate guide to getting started in today's science.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,440
And today we're talking about one of my favorite components of the design which is viz..

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,100
So I wanted to pretty verses by saying that maybe some people won't agree but I'm a firm believer that

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,030
there are two types of viz. in dataset and one is for data mining.

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,770
The other one is zation for presentation.

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,600
There is a substantial difference between them.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:47,280
Bill Zill zation for presentation is the one that people usually refer to when they talk about visualization.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,280
That's the visualization of the proper type of the position I'm doing floating quotation marks here.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,020
That's just what people think of when they say that.

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:06,600
And that's creating beautiful images beautiful interactive charts and graphs and dashboards and things

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,430
that you will want to show others you will that will aid you in explaining your insides to others.

13
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,840
But at the same time there's a very important part of his position as well which is called visualization

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
for data mining.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,550
And I personally use that term maybe others use call it something else but that is when you prefer to

16
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:34,590
see your data rather than to work with the numbers themselves and to get to the insights.

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,600
So a lot of people will straight away when they have a probable jump into something like machine learning

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,680
approach or something like that.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,640
I personally always preferred to first look at the data and use some analytics tools to understand how

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,300
it works.

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,520
So the way we'll go about this is we'll talk about visualization for data mining further down in the

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,980
course and you'll actually get to do that in practice and you'll get a feel for it and visualization

23
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,760
of a presentation.

24
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,670
I'll give you a great example right now so you can see the difference you get an understanding of what

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,000
we mean by visualization representation.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,890
So let's get straight into it.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,640
So here I'm going to go to the right and I've got Google open.

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:24,560
So if in Google you look for visual cinamon you will find one of my favorite blogs on visualization.

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,110
And so he actually got the Web site open here.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,250
I'm just going to go here.

31
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,640
Right.

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:35,500
And you can see right away as you enter you're greeted with some amazing visualization already something's

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,030
going on.

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,770
And then pretty sure there is some story behind it as well.

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,490
And if you scroll down you will see all these different lovely lobby positions.

36
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,880
This blog is run by the Bremmer Pramer Lady Cramer.

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,410
There she is.

38
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,410
And I wanted to show you one of them today.

39
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,560
So in your free time feel free to scroll around them and read through them and interact with them but

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,340
I wanted to show you which one I think is this one here.

41
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,170
We're going to look at this one which she did for The Guardian.

42
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,220
And I've got it open or over here it's called bust out and this is all zation is telling a story and

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,210
that it is insured by the way I wanted to mention that data science is all about telling stories telling

44
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,840
stories with data with and with visuals.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:39,000
And so this is how Americans move how America moves homeless how governments move around homeless people.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,990
You know two different states.

47
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:50,910
And so here you can see like one small exultation of how a one homeless person was bought a ticket for

48
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:58,000
a bar or a bus ticket and he had to travel 2000 miles and three days to reach his destination.

49
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,380
So if he keeps crawling you'll see like you know some some other things up here.

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,050
How beautiful was this.

51
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,380
And I'll look at this.

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,160
This is amazing.

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,040
This is like like a movie.

54
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,900
So this is

55
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,480
again different cities in different states moving by bus tickets to.

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,380
Let's go back.

57
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,840
So that goodies buying tickets to homeless people to send them to other places.

58
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,340
And it's a very sad story if you actually think about it like how these different states and cities

59
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,450
are trying to move homeless people away out of their cities and then other cities are moving them into

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,520
their cities.

61
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,950
So you can see here by the year as the years pass and all of this is data all of this is based on data.

62
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,810
So we're seeing the data rather than looking at a spreadsheet rather looking at numbers.

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,220
And as you can see it's done very very nicely of course this took a lot of time and it's done in more

64
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,860
advanced tool.

65
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,210
This is I think this is done in D-3 much more of.

66
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,220
But this is a type of data size Ramer is a data scientists used to work.

67
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,620
And what I think is Netherlands though.

68
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:21,350
So if you keep scrolling in some stories some more stories then there's there's hundreds were flown

69
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:30,560
overseas even so you see that somebody was flown to New Zealand just to relocate them so you can keep

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,380
scrolling you'll find like more examples.

71
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,260
Here again this is visualization of you can see that it is telling a story we're understanding better

72
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,400
what's happening even before reading it.

73
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:48,020
You can already see that this is a massive problem a massive issue and it might need.

74
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,940
It needs addressing the public needs to know about it.

75
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,620
What else is here.

76
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,040
Some some additional in size a static Wetzel's.

77
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,260
Then what else do we have.

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,480
So if we keep scrolling those are nice.

79
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,770
So here at the bottom

80
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:16,910
this is where you received the travelers who they are sent to siblings grandparents parents and children.

81
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:27,650
Sometimes it's institutions relatives and here for example I really liked this one.

82
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,110
So it tells a good story.

83
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:37,250
So here is San Francisco's bus program impacts house fences with the program impacts the homeless population

84
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,770
and you will see this is the city homeless population.

85
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:50,170
This is on buses bus journeys into the city so people who are homeless who was sent to San Francisco.

86
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,760
This is people bus stories out of the city so if we keep scrolling you'll see this start to start working

87
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,210
and you see the years changing here.

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,880
And so you can see that this is how many people were went out of San Francisco and now they're going

89
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,160
to do a comparison now like what my San Francisco homeless population have looked like if homeless people

90
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,310
had never bussed into and out of the city

91
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,050
how amazing is that how how beautiful is that.

92
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:33,450
It is also shown because again you can see very subtle very clean very nice and then now goes back and

93
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,200
they take these loans out and they put these in and you can see it would be so much larger would be

94
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,760
twice as twice as large.

95
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,400
So there you go.

96
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,540
That's more than twice that's the story.

97
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,910
That's the data side of the story.

98
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,690
I encourage you to check out this article it's on the Guardian dot com.

99
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,550
It's quite quite new as well and lots of interesting insights here.

100
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,140
And of course check out Lindy's Web site if you'd like to see some more amazing missile's patients she

101
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,800
puts in a lot of time into her work and this is Weasel's action for presentation.

102
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,970
Of course this is a very extreme example in the sense that I would take a long time to create something

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,890
as beautiful as this.

104
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,160
But this is still the point still stands.

105
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,330
This is a type of data size.

106
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,930
And then she has built her own career on this her own freelance career.

107
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,540
In fact I also wanted to recommend to you here if you go to this has a Comsec 81.

108
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,920
You will be redirected to this page.

109
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,050
The first episode of the suppressants podcast is called.

110
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,970
There it is zation and how to freelance your passion is actually with Mindy so you can actually see

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,210
her.

112
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,900
This is an audio version on soundcloud and iTunes if you want but otherwise you can watch on YouTube.

113
00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:00,720
Our conversation about visualization and also how she built her day science career around just visit

114
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,080
zation all she's done of course much more.

115
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,000
She worked in R and other tools but now her career is predominately focused on this session.

116
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,800
Highly recommend.

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,480
Check out this episode I really enjoyed the conversation and heard some great feedback about it afterwards

118
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,210
as well and can give you some additional insight and of that thought.

119
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,650
I hope you enjoyed today's Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you next time.

120
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,680
Until then enjoy Davison's.
