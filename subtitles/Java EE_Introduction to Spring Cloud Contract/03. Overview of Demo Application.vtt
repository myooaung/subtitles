00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.210
[Autogenerated] Now we're ready.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.620
We're going to be using spring Cloud contract with the consumer

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.350
driven contract testing technique in order to implement of

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.840
feature in a micro services architecture.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.760
We'll be doing something very basic as initially.

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.350
What we want to focus on is achieving offense.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.360
Slice for the entire workflow and to end the micro service we're going to

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.680
be working on is a credit card micro service implement in a feature which

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.640
allows people to apply for credit cards,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.140
not wanting to give credit to anyone.

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.040
We want our micro service to be able to chat a credit score of the application,

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.230
but Robert Andino yourself is going to offload the

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.540
responsibility turn of a micro service.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.450
We've decided this is cleaner moments.

15
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.340
Hey, nable,

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.610
as it's a separate business functionality that can now be

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.700
independent to the rest of the system.

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.210
And this separate credit score Micro Service will return to credit score to our

19
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:12.000
credit card micro service and then that will be able to reject or a set the application based on some internal business rules
