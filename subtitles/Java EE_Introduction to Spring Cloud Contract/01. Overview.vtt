[Autogenerated] Hi.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.710
My name's Andrew Morgan on Welcome to the course introduction

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.930
to Stream cloud contracts in this module,

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.660
we're going to take a hands on approach to consumer driven

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.210
contract testing with a goal of being able to use spring

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.040
cloud contract to build Hey, TTP based job and micro Services.

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.700
First,

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.950
we'll introduce when cloud contract explain its core

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.410
functionality on how it can be used to achieve the consumer

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.640
driven contract testing technique.

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.860
Well,

12
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.230
then use it to implement to hate DTP based Spring

13
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.840
Boot Micro services following fruit,

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.740
a consumer driven contracts testing workflow and two ends.

15
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.860
This will include learning how to define contracts

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.140
using a contract definition language.

17
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340
We'll learn how to generate stops in contract verification

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.040
tests using the spring cloud contract verifier.

19
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.850
And finally,

20
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.000
we'll learn how to actually cute stops on the consumer side by using the stop runner
