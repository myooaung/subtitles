00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.700
[Autogenerated] That's it for this module we've built on

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.060
this simple and to end example in the previous module on

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.020
introduce more advanced concepts,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.000
which should be enough to take spring cloud contract into your organization.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.850
This includes explaining how we can create in support,

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.480
multiple contracts, how we can use rejects too much and dynamic data,

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.050
and how spring cloud contract gives us a rejects

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.130
obstruction that makes it simple.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.810
And we've also introduced to consumer and produce,

10
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.860
um, efforts,

11
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.340
explaining how we can have granular control over both

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.890
sides of the interaction in our contract.

13
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.840
Finally, we've lit a decentralized contract repository,

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.140
explaining how it could be used to decouple contracts from their micro services,

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.830
demonstrating how keeping everything together like this makes our

16
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.800
micro service interactions easier to reason about.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.430
In the next module will start using Spring Cloud contract to

18
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.440
implement message driven applications.

19
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.390
Learning how to test drive asynchronous communication in this way

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:15.000
through contracts is a very powerful concept that will help us deliver mocha service based systems more rapidly
