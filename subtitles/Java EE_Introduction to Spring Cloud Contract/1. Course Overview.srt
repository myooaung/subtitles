[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,080
I'm wondering Morgan on Welcome to my plan or psy course

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,170
introduction to spring Cloud contract.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,860
I'm an independent consultant, trainer and conference speaker,

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,140
most recently specializing in both Java micro services and continuous delivery.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,160
Although micro services architectures are becoming very popular,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,750
Tassan um can be hard on overcome in any challenges.

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,450
Could be tough when using the more traditional testing strategies.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,830
This course will introduce you to Spring Cloud Contract,

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,280
a consumer driven contract testing JBM based micro services framework.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,090
Some of the major topics it will cover includes micro services testing

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,410
challenges on the short communes of traditional testing approaches.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,630
How we can use a consumer driven contract testing technique to test micro

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,180
services more effectively and finally building and testing both.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,640
Hate TTP driven a message driven Java micro services with spring

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
cloud contracts on consumer driven contract testing.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,940
By the end of the course,

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,440
you'll notice basics of spring cloud contracts and consumer driven

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,960
contract testing on you'll be able to use it to develop and test your own

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,260
job and micro services before beginning the course.

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,800
You should know Java,

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,500
and it would also be beneficial to have some knowledge

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,670
of micro services on spring boot.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,590
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to more

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:46,000
effectively Tash Java Micro Services with the introduction to Spring Cloud contract course Applera site.
