00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.170
[Autogenerated] So why did goals for this course?

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.760
Well,

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480
it's not just learning spring cloud contract as

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.420
there's some core theoretical concepts.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.520
To learn to this means will split things up into free areas.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.970
First,

7
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.490
we're going to learn about the additional testing complexity that

8
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.810
Michael Services architectures can introduce.

9
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.660
This will help his realize why the traditional testing

10
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.870
approaches might not work on also understand the motivation for

11
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.540
spring cloud contract in the first place.

12
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.020
We're also going to be learning about the consumer

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.520
driven contracts testing technique.

14
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.280
This is because spring cloud contract is a consumer

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.540
driven contract testing framework,

16
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.890
so we really need to understand it before diving into any practical work.

17
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.960
Finally, on,

18
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.480
This is the main goal of the course will become

19
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.490
proficient in using spring cloud contracts.

20
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.430
Will do this tree both coding exercises and theoretical work

21
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.620
with the aim to take away what we've learned.

22
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.240
A new spring cloud contract to test our micro services applications.

23
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.190
So before we get started, we'll just go over the prerequisites for the course.

24
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.030
First of all,

25
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.670
some knowledge of Javaris and most spring cloud

26
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.490
contract is part of the Java ecosystem,

27
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.040
and it's a job and mocha services application that will be working on

28
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.340
throughout the course on Understanding of Maven would be useful to,

29
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.970
as will be using it for dependency management.

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.280
However, if you use grade all that,

31
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.640
most of what we learn can be transposed to that built all also on

32
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.140
understanding of micro services would also be useful.

33
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.710
It's the pitfalls of working with them that should lead to

34
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.940
adopting spring cloud contract in the first place.

35
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.770
Don't worry about this team much so as we'll be covering

36
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.840
the basics for out this first module.

37
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.560
Some familiarity re spring could also help,

38
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.960
but isn't a necessity will be using spring boot to help

39
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.090
his build and test or application,

40
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.300
but everything will be explained along the way.

41
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.050
Finally, we'll need a Java idea using whichever we prefer is fine.

42
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.000
But just to know Intelli J will be used for all of the life. Temer's
