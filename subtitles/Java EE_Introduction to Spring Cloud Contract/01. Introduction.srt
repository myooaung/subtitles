[Autogenerated] Hi, I'm under Morgan on Welcome to the course.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,120
Introduction to Spring Cloud contract in this module will be building on what

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,320
we've learned so far by introducing some more advanced,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,540
consumer driven contract testing principles.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,500
First of all,

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,630
we're going to take a look at how we can support multiple

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,940
contracts between a consumer under provider.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,840
As currently, we have only supported a single interaction.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,340
We'll also look at how a contract can support multiple

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,050
requests via regular expressions,

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,380
which is particularly useful when we account for dynamic

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,080
data such a your I DS or Time stamps.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,990
Then we'll learn about how we can have more granular control over

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,800
both the consumer and provide a side of our interaction by

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,270
leveraging the consumer and producer methods and finally will learn

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:05,000
about the shared repository pattern, a means of centralizing all of our contracts together into a single repository.
