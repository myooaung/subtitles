00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.570
Hello and welcome back to the course and blog chain.

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.440
And today we're going to have an excursion into the world of mining pools.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.940
Let's get started.

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.060
All right so here's our network of miners who which we've seen before we know how this works.

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.290
They all turn away.

6
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.100
They compete at that cryptographic puzzle and it's more or less fair it's a fair competition.

7
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.230
They can really get a reward at some point.

8
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.450
However as we saw from the previous tutorial there are these huge industrial size mines with tons and

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.740
tons of rigs who also join the network.

10
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.880
So let's imagine that these two here are actually like were replaced by industrial ones.

11
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.090
And so in this case how is it that somebody can compete when I have my tiny laptop or whatever it is

12
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.850
like a mining unit that I purchased.

13
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.720
And I'm here all by myself.

14
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.000
And then there is this industrial mine with tons of employees with huge rigs and so on.

15
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.920
It's just unfair.

16
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.630
Like my chances of solving the Rafic puzzle before them is like 1 million to one trillion.

17
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.470
There's no way I will ever ever ever find the golden Non's before them.

18
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.810
And so how does that happen.

19
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.240
Like what.

20
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.340
What's the point.

21
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.240
At the end of the day if there's these players.

22
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.750
And yet despite this we've all probably heard of a friend of a friend who has a neighbor who has purchased

23
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.840
a mining rig and he's writing a he or she is running it at home and they are you know very excited about

24
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.630
it and they still doing it.

25
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.240
So are their efforts completely in vain.

26
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.490
Well no because after this start to happen or somewhere maybe before around the same time basically

27
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.460
what was invented was mining pools.

28
00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.430
And now miners actually don't just mind for themselves they enter mining pools such as like here and

29
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.120
here.

30
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.600
And what happens is these miners they come by in their hashing power.

31
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.790
They combine their processing power into this mining pool.

32
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.880
So now they all of a sudden there's they have more power together.

33
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.730
It's very similar to what triple and what the mining pool provides is a service the money will provide

34
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.270
a service where the mining pool distributes the work among the miners in such a way that they're not

35
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.400
doing double work.

36
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.200
And this is a very important concept to remember because there wouldn't be much point in a mining pool

37
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.040
if they would all be solving like attempting the exact same block configuration of that exact same nonces

38
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.650
if they would be doing double work then the what's the point of them combining their hash rates and

39
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
power.

40
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.520
So a very important service that a mining pool provides is it distributes the cryptographic puzzle among

41
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.720
the miners and how can that be done.

42
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.520
Well a very simplistic view of that is we remember that there's the onset with attempting to find the

43
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.950
golden lawns by just brute forcing through the on through different roof and valleys of the.

44
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.610
So the money ball can just say OK so I'm going to give you like we're starting in your blog you're going

45
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.160
to look at and they can unknowns from zero to 1 billion.

46
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.440
You're looking from one billion to two billion.

47
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.240
You're looking for values of the notes from 2 billion to $3 and you are going from 3 billion to four

48
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.240
billion and so the non-SS values have been distributed among them.

49
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
So they have enough Non's to go through and that's it and that's what they're doing and then then what

50
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:48.160
happens is as soon as one of them finds the golden lawn's this mining pool wins the reward and the fees

51
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.930
for the for that block and then how is it then split among them.

52
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.020
Well it's split proportionately to the hashing power that they introduced into the mind people.

53
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.350
So very similar to what Schickel like in a lottery pool if you buy if you buy it or if you put $10 in

54
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.770
and this person puts $100 in and you want triple wins then you're going to get these guys they are going

55
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.420
to get 10 times more than you will get.

56
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.720
So if you get $5 they'll get $50 Orio for you figure $500 will get $5000 because it's proportionate

57
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.310
to the mileage you contributed.

58
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.670
Same thing here just the contribution is measured in hash rate and how much can be additional power

59
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.850
you providing to the pool.

60
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.430
And so yeah.

61
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.310
So that's it's that's how that's all there is for mining coal it provides a service to distribute the

62
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.920
additional power and works exactly lecture.

63
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.190
And of course it takes sort of a certain fee for what they're doing so why the pools are usually like

64
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.290
a web site or an organization.

65
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.450
They all have Web sites where you can just go and download the software and install it.

66
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.620
And also in fact mining pools do not discriminate.

67
00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.540
Anybody can join in my pool including these big industrial sized rigs which they do.

68
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.450
And therefore now it's more fair.

69
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.490
So you have these large money pools you can switch around between them.

70
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.240
We don't like this when you can go to this one like that and go out to that other one.

71
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.180
And then you can will see their high rates just now you can see exactly what power they have and then

72
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.230
which no matter who wins they split.

73
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.650
And you know the more power the pool the more power a pool has the more players it has so the last portion

74
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.670
of the fee the bless portion of the reward you will get.

75
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.780
So it's kind of like a tradeoff.

76
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.260
So it's all fair.

77
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.820
So there we go.

78
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.030
That's what a money pool does provides a service first and foremost.

79
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.180
But there's another thing that money pool is beneficial for.

80
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.560
And that thing is they completely remove the headache from individual miners.

81
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.530
And to illustrate the point I wanted to show you something you can buy on Ebay.

82
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.150
Here is so.

83
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.710
Cryptocurrency GP you mining rig for a theory of Zad cash Bitcoin extras and so on.

84
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.100
And yeah so what miners do is they just you can just go and buy one of these.

85
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.960
You install it in your house you doll.

86
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.090
You choose a money pool you go to the Web site you download the software and then that's it you install

87
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.470
the software by installing the software what you're doing is you're pointing this mining rig which belongs

88
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.020
to you.

89
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.340
You're pointing its harsh power higher rates to the mining pool you choose or you can choose out of

90
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.400
three mining pools and or whatever number of money pools and because he has told you choose one you

91
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.500
install the software and that redirects all of this computational power to that money pool and that's

92
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.460
it you don't have to do anything you don't have to know how Bitcoins work you don't have to know what

93
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.940
a blog chain is you don't have to know what unknown's is.

94
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.380
In fact my my guess would be that a lot of the miners that actually use these rigs they don't even know

95
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.940
what they're guessing they don't know that they're actually solving the cryptographic puzzle by guessing

96
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.780
the loans because they need to find find their Chateau-Renaud 56 hash which is irreversible you know.

97
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.480
And has that all those properties that we talked about.

98
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.710
So yeah and so it takes away all of that headache from the miners.

99
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.960
And I guess in a way that is viewed in a way that's bad.

100
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.680
But it is what it is.

101
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.320
And so before we move on from this slide I wanted to point out something here a little preview of what's

102
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.800
to come a little snippet of the future.

103
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.690
So you'll notice here it says GP mining and ethereal.

104
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.850
So be careful these GP mining rigs which you can get on e-bay.

105
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.120
They no longer work for bitcoin.

106
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:41.650
They only work for other big currencies such as or verticals such as a theory and Zed cash here.

107
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.770
Not sure says it can go less sure about that but this one for sure will not work for Bitcoin.

108
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:56.210
The reason for that is because in bitcoins now we have A-6 which were introduced in 2014 and in Egypt

109
00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:03.680
use are completely outdated now it's like that and it's like going to war with a stick with a wooden

110
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.020
sword versus somebody who comes in with a machine gun and we'll talk about A-6 more in the future in

111
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.440
a coming storm on this section for sure will definitely cover up.

112
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.050
But I just wanted to point out that this is not a bitcoin mining rig.

113
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.070
This is actually a theory in mining.

114
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.020
OK.

115
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.780
And now we're going to move on to some examples.

116
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.530
All right.

117
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:30.630
So here we have Blockley not call a lovely website where we go a lot of the time.

118
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:36.710
And then if we go to chards here let's have a look at these mining pools right here.

119
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.670
Mining information.

120
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:47.310
So if you go to high Schrade distribution you will see the hasher of how the hash rates or the power

121
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.540
to solve the cryptographic puzzle is split between the pools.

122
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.470
So here you've got the biggest pools listed.

123
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.560
So BTC adcom is currently the biggest one then.

124
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:06.900
And Paul VI a b c b c top slush pool and some unknown pool I guess or maybe this is people are just

125
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:13.260
miners who are not in pools or you know like the other the remainder of the pools I guess then you've

126
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.350
got some more.

127
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.330
So you can see that the joint B.C dot com they have twenty six point eight of the total hash rate.

128
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:27.390
And this is in the past I think this is in the past 24 hours they have a total of 26 percent of the

129
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.480
total hash rate of the network.

130
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.620
And so they have basically a twenty six point eight percent chance of creating the new block and Poole

131
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.650
has a fourteen point seven by BDC eleven point two.

132
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.820
So question is why would you choose to join any other poor example.

133
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.370
BTC well same answer as before.

134
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:52.860
There is more players this shows that like you have a fix your you have a certain Asheri you bring it

135
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.190
here you will get.

136
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:04.620
You always get a portion of the reward proportionate to your high rate compared to everybody else because

137
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.690
theres more and more Hatchard here so youll get to have a high chance of winning but will get a small

138
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.500
very small reward.

139
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.040
They have a small chance of winning but youll get a slightly higher rate and so on.

140
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:22.020
So its a tradeoff and you have to look at what fees they charge what else you know like what other conditions

141
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.800
they have about being Parvis for and also you can if you go just the data and you look at the blogs

142
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.480
you can see who mind their most recent blog site.

143
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.090
So if you can see that here.

144
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.070
It's easy to see that column is actually doing quite a lot.

145
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.960
You don't see Paul here at all.

146
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.500
They only come up here but that's you know it's a game of chance in the long run.

147
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:50.770
According to the law of large numbers if you take a lot of days a lot of blocks then those those percentages

148
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.120
will show themselves more accurate.

149
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.130
OK.

150
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.900
So those are the rules.

151
00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:02.260
Here's a couple examples so this is the Web site for BTC dot com by the way I'm not advocating any of

152
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:02.750
them.

153
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.000
I have not used any of them so it's totally up to like you know the person who decides.

154
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.500
And again we have to always figure out if bitcoin mining is for you and it's just interesting to look

155
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:14.620
at.

156
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.830
That's why the only reason this is not financial advice.

157
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.780
The only reason we look at them is because this is the really interesting new standards for mining services

158
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.020
really sounds like like you know a coal mine or a gold mine or something like they have mining services

159
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.480
for miners.

160
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:31.650
OK.

161
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.610
So they have some information here you can sign up and stuff like that.

162
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:47.380
There's an pool again with corn you see click and start mining and slush ball flushable is very first

163
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.180
the world's first Bitcoin mining pool.

164
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.780
It's it's it's actually in Czech Republic Yeah and you know this is their ropes.

165
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.800
I just want to show you so that's all that is you.

166
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.530
It just goes to one of these Web sites.

167
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.200
The software and that's when they get started.

168
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:09.180
That's as simple as oh by the way this is told you are watching these guys from Czech Republic but their

169
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.840
AI I think has an Australian accent so if you have a chance to listen to this it's really fun.

170
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.150
But you know like I totally respect it just the accent.

171
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.960
I was surprised the Czech company but with an Australian accent and they I my room as they might be

172
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.750
like in a different accent but to me sounds Australian.

173
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.520
OK.

174
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.280
And then I wanted to show you some other stuff here.

175
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.760
So this is run by Bitcoin world wide dot com.

176
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.850
There's an interesting article here.

177
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.870
Percentage of concentric concentration of pools.

178
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:48.060
And you can see that China has 81 percent or at the time of the writing of this article which was July

179
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.900
of 2017 China was at 81 percent.

180
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:59.340
All of the hash power is in China then Iceland Japan Czech Republic Georgia India.

181
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.550
Why China.

182
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.440
Why.

183
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.220
And by the way.

184
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:10.070
So all these top ones and China BTC top China China China China China China China.

185
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.880
This one is Norway or Iceland.

186
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.060
Iceland.

187
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.970
Excuse me.

188
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:27.800
And then slash bought just about so why China that the answer is it's about the price of electricity.

189
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:36.410
So all things equal the price of electricity dictates where you're going to set up your mining rig or

190
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.250
where you're going to have more miners.

191
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.830
And in China a lot of electricity is subsidized in fact.

192
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:51.650
I've heard I've read somewhere that it's speculated that in some places the electricity was sort of

193
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:58.100
what they called the plans they redirect their excess electricity to Bitcoin miners just so that it

194
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.620
doesn't go to waste and like it's subsidized to some country like huge amounts and so on so energy which

195
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.580
is great in China is super cheap and that's why a lot of the mining operations are actually happening

196
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:10.950
in China.

197
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:19.850
In fact people sometimes go from overseas to China or to countries with lower electricity prices just

198
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:25.790
to set up their mining rigs there because electricity is the biggest cost for miners especially if you're

199
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.900
going you know like fool in Iceland.

200
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.460
I'm not sure I guess electricity prices are not are also subsidized.

201
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.390
I'm not sure about that can come into that but I know that about.

202
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.070
So yeah something interesting to know.

203
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.710
So if you're planning on building a huge mining operation always think about electricity.

204
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.810
Who are you going to be competing with.

205
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.360
And you're going to be competing with where it's very cheap.

206
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:54.290
But again like I've heard also that the government in China is that is becoming such a big like a big

207
00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:00.830
problem there that they're considering of banning or you know like putting some restrictions on how

208
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.030
mine is electricity.

209
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:08.720
So that's something Astakhov for that might come Politti change completely changes Jard if that happens

210
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:16.160
again and this next one is just interesting bitcoin mining now consumes more urgency than 159 countries

211
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.990
together.

212
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.630
Individual countries so this is a word and a bit weird.

213
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:30.740
So for example all of these countries the orange ones they use less electricity per year than Bitcoin

214
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.260
miners use per year.

215
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:39.720
So basically what an interesting example is that Bitcoin miners use more electricity than Ireland uses.

216
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:45.980
Who would have thought thought that was was not that warm water which is which is there but anyway so

217
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:55.360
these are the countries and Bitcoin miners will be hundred and here the miners would be like 159.

218
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.900
So the hour runs from here.

219
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:04.710
So basically I think they would be somewhere here what place that would be but there would be 64 miners

220
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.850
or a country they would rank 6:02 first in terms of world electricity consumption.

221
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.480
That's pretty crazy if you think about it that way.

222
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.160
So yeah.

223
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:23.720
So Bitcoin uses up a lot a lot of electricity for the what they're doing so here you can see the countries

224
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.220
where Bitcoin actually uses more than the orange ones.

225
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.420
Bitcoin miners use electricity in these countries.

226
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.730
So it's a huge statistic of course.

227
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.230
And this brings us to the end of the Tauriel.

228
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:42.890
But what I wanted to share with you at the end is some additional reading and additional reading is

229
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.470
this article called bitcoin mining and energy consumption.

230
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.010
It's by Leo WIESS.

231
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.630
We say we so I guess our medium.

232
00:16:53.630 --> 00:17:01.520
So again the link will be in the show not in the show but it will be in the tutorial in of course not

233
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:08.330
so why I wanted to share this article is because it give you some good arguments because this is a common

234
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:16.250
topic for debate where people say Bitcoin because it uses a lot of electricity you know Bitcoin is evil

235
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.170
and things like that.

236
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:24.640
And you know as we saw yes it was just in some countries here he gives examples of how you can make

237
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.030
it like Indra when you put things relative to each other.

238
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.730
Some things might seem large or things might seem small.

239
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.170
It's all relative comparison so when you put it here you give some arguments where you can make it seem

240
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:42.230
big like we just did now and then he also gives us some arguments where you can make it seem small.

241
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:51.010
For example Bitcoin uses less electricity than 17 NSA data centers combined.

242
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:57.230
I thought it was an asset s.a.a or you know Bitcoin only uses 20 percent or energy of a single coal

243
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.560
power plant in Taiwan.

244
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.740
So when you put it like that it sounds very small.

245
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:06.500
So I thought it was an interesting comparison and you know puts you like whether you want to be an opponent

246
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.070
or a proponent give you some some facts to deal with some way to prosper.

247
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:11.600
All right.

248
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.070
So there are additional reading.

249
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.670
Hope you enjoyed today's Totoro and I look forward to seeing you next then.

250
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.540
Until then enjoy elections.
