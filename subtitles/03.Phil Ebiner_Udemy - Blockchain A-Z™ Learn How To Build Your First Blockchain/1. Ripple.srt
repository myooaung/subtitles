00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,270
Hi everyone and welcome to this lecture where we will be focusing on Ripl also known as X R.P. as is

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,980
one of the most prominent and popular forms of crypto currencies today.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,600
And due to its impact in the banking sector can also be seen as one of the main disruptive technologies

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,330
currently shaping the industry.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,900
But let's start off with a bit of historical background before we jump into some further details for

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,760
Ripl the company building the protocol open coin was founded by CEO Chris Larsen and CTO Jed.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,540
Originally released in 2012.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,050
It was written in C++ and one of the most interesting aspects is that the network can operate without

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,450
the company entirely but it can even claim to go back to 2004.

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,900
With the ripple project the founders had extensive experience coming into this with digital currencies

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,320
including working with companies that handled Bitcoin trades and online financial companies.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,820
Although Ripl does attract less attention than some specific other cryptocurrency currencies report

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,240
has the second highest market cap.

14
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:11,310
One of the huge benefits is that ripple can be used for any currency exchanged ranging from traditional

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,510
currencies commodities or even frequent flyer miles.

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,630
The ripple network was originally created with a 100 billion units.

17
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,640
Rebel was intended to be more efficient.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,300
Such as not utilizing large amounts of electricity to mine so you can exchange anything of value in

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,560
an efficient way.

20
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,810
And we did mention earlier that we could see here in a brief example how it works.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,480
From the following brochure if you get the chance take a look through it because it has some great information.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,370
And keep in mind that these terms here.

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,720
The liquidity it's going to come more to play later with a huge attraction of ripple related to liquidity.

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,180
But we could start getting an idea here of this schema how it works and who uses it.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,700
Think of the banking sector and keep liquidity in mind.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,350
We'll get to that in a moment.

27
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,010
So you may be thinking what are some of the benefits of ripple ripple benefits include speed.

28
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,530
And then is that X is over 1000 times faster than bitcoin in terms of confirmation time.

29
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,330
The transaction cost is also much lower.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,090
It has a higher quality of validators and processing and it's also ready for enterprise use which we

31
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,220
can see when we discuss the financial sector picking up rubble.

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,270
It's also open source software and anyone can run a server validator.

33
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,910
And as we've mentioned earlier as an example if the ripple company disappeared it would still function.

34
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,540
So those are some pretty crucial benefits you're talking about speed and lower transaction costs.

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,700
Those are two key elements within cryptocurrency.

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,620
In addition if you are worrying about more SRP being created the transaction rules are deterministic

37
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:55,090
and software is open source so there's no way to create more Ripl currently holds about $60 billion

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,050
SRP or 60 percent of X R.P. that will exist with 55 billion locked in escrow to be released over fifty

39
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,150
five months and that's intended to provide supply predictability over a set length of period of time.

40
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,120
The Leger's are public adding increase transparency.

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,180
And David Schwartz who is the chief cryptographer at Ripl mentioned that through 2018 the company plans

42
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,140
to focus on adding additional validators for decentralization.

43
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,370
And you may be wondering how Ripl compares to bit coin or how Ripl sees themselves.

44
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,460
But Ripl actually has positioned itself as a compliment to Bitcoin because you can use it for any currency.

45
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,530
Remember we talked about earlier the currencies commodities you can exchange Ripl for any type of currency.

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,430
And of course we have to mention blotching ripples payment network ripple net uses the block chain technology

47
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,260
but Ripl is in mind.

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,680
The company has control.

49
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,190
We talked about the distribution in the earlier slide.

50
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,480
And to reiterate a block chain is a public ledger containing transaction data for anyone who uses the

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,170
service.

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,300
Transactions are added to blocks orderings of code that make up the chain and each transaction must

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,000
be recorded on the block.

54
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,280
Blotching one of the most crucial if not the most crucial components of crypto currencies.

55
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,020
And here we arrive at the financial institutions and I mentioned earlier to try and keep liquidity in

56
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,710
mind.

57
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:25,210
And one of the most interesting aspects about Ripl and what makes it highly attractive is that for financial

58
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,860
institutions it has that such appeal related to liquidity.

59
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,960
And we see with a quote from Ripl CEO Brad Garlinghouse that he mentions liquidity needs of banks that

60
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,080
is managed with literally 10 trillions of float that sits in these no show and offshore accounts.

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,750
We believe very strong this is an inefficient model you can use digital assets to fund liquidity and

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,370
Ripl is uniquely positioned to capitalize on that.

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,440
Bitcoin takes four hours to settle a transaction where SRP takes 3.6 seconds.

64
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,780
You can imagine the benefits of financial institutions being able to make these transactions in such

65
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,290
a decrease the amount of time 3.6 seconds is almost lightning fast for a transaction time.

66
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,200
And if you get the chance you can visit the brochure mentioned here.

67
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,730
And we had it earlier.

68
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,650
We could jump over to that really quickly.

69
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,220
If youre able to scroll through it take the time to look at some of the information and how Ripl presents

70
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,340
itself and ripple in the SRP it is one of the main crypto currencies and its definitely here to stay

71
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,760
with its appeal to financial institutions all along with its speed lower transaction costs.

72
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,010
Those are some crucial components allowing people to succeed within the cryptocurrency environment.

73
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,040
In addition keep an eye out for what Ripl is doing within the next few years of the company.

74
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,410
As we mentioned earlier are working on implementing some additional decentralization options and I still

75
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,590
think we have much more to see to come.

76
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,450
Related to report and its impact in the cryptocurrency market and also in the financial market especially

77
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,500
related to currency exchanges and financial transactions.

78
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,290
With that we can wrap things up if you have any questions.

79
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,210
As always please feel free to share them and I will see you in the next video.
