00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello and welcome back to the course on blog.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,020
How did you go of the procedural with the transactions and UTX shows.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,080
I really hope you had a chance to kind of rethink the things that we talked about and maybe even practice

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,960
a couple of times.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,700
And today we'll talk about where transactions fees come from.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,430
We'll definitely continue practicing what we learned previously to solidify that knowledge but really

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,530
build on top of that a little bit and we'll see where the fees come from.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,180
So let's get started.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,550
All right so so far I've bought two bicycles with my bitcoins.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:44,960
And as we remember i have that one unspent transaction output left from a transaction that works and

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,480
to me of one BTC has been hanging in there for quite a while now.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,390
All right so let's say in the meantime in between the tutorials a couple of more people have sent me

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,430
transactions and the blocks have been mines and these transactions are in the system.

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:07,170
And so here they are so are certain to be zero point one BTC Adlon sent me 0.4 BTC.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:15,400
Ebay sent me a reply through BTC Maybe I sold something there and eidolon sent me Agins 0.3 BTC.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,040
All right so those are our current UTX sales.

17
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,750
Let's see what I want to buy now.

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:30,100
And today I want to go and buy a third bicycle for 0.9 BDC and an apple for zero point zero to PDC.

19
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,150
So I was walking home and I saw an apple and I decided to buy it because I wanted to eat it.

20
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:44,050
And so let's construct the transactions that are going to make this happen or the transaction one transaction

21
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,190
is going to make this happen and we already know that we can put we can have multiple inputs and multiple

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:55,190
outputs and so all of this you know like in banking you'd have to send you know to one transaction or

23
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:01,540
the bike shop and watch the action of the fruit shop in watching you just do one transaction and you

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,220
get everything done right away.

25
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,800
All right so our inputs.

26
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,170
How much do we need in total Let's calculate that we need 0.9 to BTC.

27
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:16,660
So what can what you take so can we take to combine them into 0.22.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,300
So if we take let's have a good start.

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,650
So input will take this report from Adlon because that's the first one and then we'll take the 0.3 from

30
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,730
E-bay.

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,070
We'll take the other 0.3 BTC from Adlon and interesting to note here that you know I said the money

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,420
twice but that doesn't get accelerated into one UTX So that's separate transactions that happen.

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,070
They need to continue they need to feed into another transaction in this case we're letting them feed

34
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,170
into this transaction.

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:53,440
And so in total that gives us 0.4 plus or 3 0 3 at one point in total and that's more than we need which

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
is good.

37
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:02,200
And so that's going to be our input and output is going to be well naturally 0.9 BDC to the bike shop

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,680
to get the bike zero point zero to BTC to the future for the apple and the rest.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,140
The change as we can see that's less than our input though the changes we know because just the time

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,750
that we need to send it back to ourselves.

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,710
So zero point 0 6 BTC to myself I know what you're thinking.

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,360
We'll get to it in a second.

43
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:31,420
So what happens from where we were learned that this because these transactions this transaction has

44
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,870
fit into here now it no longer is a UTI.

45
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:42,240
So there is no output that is left on just hanging it's already taken up by this transaction this transaction

46
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,620
same thing this transaction same thing.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,750
So we could just get rid of them out of all of you take those.

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,770
So this Amman's will grow it will become a takes over the bike shop this Amman's will become another

49
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,890
you are not should say for each of you takes over the.

50
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,190
And this will be a you take so for me so I'll go into here.

51
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:08,740
And so the question you're probably wondering is this doesn't add up here all this adds up to zero point

52
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,710
nine eight BTC total.

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,850
This adds up to one BTC.

54
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,270
So where did that difference go to.

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,370
Didn't you say that the change has you have to account for the changes to go back.

56
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:27,100
Well the way it works is that anything that you don't account for becomes the feed becomes the fee for

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,770
this transaction to be included in a block in the blotching.

58
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,060
We know that we've already spoken about fees.

59
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,050
We know that they're quite important and even though the auction theoretically is should be can be free.

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,330
You don't have to pay fees.

61
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,440
Nobody's making you pay fees at the same time.

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,520
There is a competition going on miners are putting these blogs in and there's a lot of transactions

63
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,260
that are waiting in the pool.

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,290
So if you want a transaction to actually be accepted you need to put a fee to kind of volunteer a fee

65
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,160
and or bid if you're a guest.

66
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,880
And so the higher the fee the more likely the question will be I said accept that sooner.

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,750
And so the way you specify the fees you don't actually there's no field to say the fee is going to be

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,340
this the fees calculate automatically what they do is they just take the total output that you have

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,720
with the total input minus the total output.

70
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,550
And whatever the difference is it is assumed that you want that to be the fee.

71
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,240
And that's where the fee comes from.

72
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,910
And so that's where the fee originates.

73
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,290
Very very simple like that.

74
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,220
And plus we had another example another section.

75
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,570
So now we update our utech sales.

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,410
So that's huge.

77
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,320
So for the minor but now we're going to update this UJA.

78
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,810
So here

79
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,060
are some I know.

80
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,670
Oh.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,650
And again of course can I forget and again the bicycle from my mom and I get an apple and now we update

82
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:58,910
this as we can see we those who takes us to get removed and now we have the money to me that should

83
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,360
be 0.06 no doubt here you take us out there we got.

84
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:03,980
So there we go.

85
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,950
That's how fees work.

86
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:13,340
And now let's have a look at some real life transactions that apply our knowledge in the real world.

87
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,640
All right so I have the luxury dot.com upset here and if we go into data and then we pick and you block

88
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:27,320
block and we go down you'll see here the transactions.

89
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,580
And so the person's action we haven't spoken much about this but it's very easy it's always the Coinbase

90
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,020
transaction it's the action that pays the minor the reward for Mining's block which is 12 and a half.

91
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,430
Bitcoins currently.

92
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,030
And it also includes as you can see it's a bit more because it includes the fee that the miner gets

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:54,050
fuzzbox all the fees for the transactions that were paid in this block they get aggregated here as well.

94
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,970
And that's the total amount.

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,030
OK.

96
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,400
So that's the first one and then these are the transactions we can have a look at.

97
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,730
You can see just as we described these are you the checks those coming from somewhere else from previous

98
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,350
transactions.

99
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,390
And there you go.

100
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:17,240
So this is our new transaction over here and they're going into new new places somebody is like buy

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,450
something moving around and because it's old crypt to topographically hashed out tell who's buying what.

102
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,480
Where money's going.

103
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:33,830
But you can tell them months you can tell what amount is going where that you've got some 0.1 1:03 or

104
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,990
you can tell where it's going but you can say see that these are monster movie.

105
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,540
What else.

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,460
So you can click on the transaction.

107
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,580
So this one and you can see how it's happening over here.

108
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,880
So another thing this amount is what's what blog.

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,060
Shane call mobilization that infer what they estimate the actual spend is because if you send your money

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,980
back to yourself you for instance one of these transaction is money going back to yourself.

111
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,930
The change then it won't be included in this amount.

112
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,190
So that's what their estimate.

113
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh no she's sorry that that's the total this amount estimated BTC transacted.

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,070
So that's the total.

115
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:19,340
So they can that you can see there that they are estimating that the payment was actually 0.1 1 3 and

116
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,570
then this is probably the amount that went back to the person themselves.

117
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,780
That's that's what they estimate.

118
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,040
And then an interesting thing here is you can go to the tree chart and you can see that the money came

119
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,760
from somewhere and then you can see how it's further purchase of the because it's the new transactions

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,240
and you block.

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,370
You can really see here so we need to go to like an older block to see that trees.

122
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,150
It's pretty interesting.

123
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:56,440
So let's pick a block and here always or go here to see the transactions.

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
And then just pick any transaction with this one.

125
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's see if this will be worth something.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,740
Yewtree chart there so you can see this one kept going so then it like what we discussed.

127
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,410
You take so I went to this one transaction.

128
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,870
This went into this transaction and then into this one so mauritians action adds it to that and then

129
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,170
it kept going.

130
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,690
So for now these are you check right now sitting there waiting to be spent.

131
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:33,380
So this one this one that you say like they added up to a whole Bitcoin and then it's moving on.

132
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,580
And now then that transaction 270 Bitcoins look we started with zero point two and one small example

133
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,790
and then this production which has been something bigger bigger bigger and then it went into a of 270

134
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,100
Bitcoin transaction.

135
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,770
Wow.

136
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,400
And then 130 Bitcoin.

137
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:58,980
So 270 Bitcoins that's like what is that going to give us 270.

138
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,590
There's like two million dollars.

139
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,640
That's a $2 million total because if Bitcoin is about those right now.

140
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,470
So that gives us 200 times.

141
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:16,620
So to have 2.7 million dollar transaction and then three Bitcoins here and then it split out like that.

142
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,990
So this is pretty cool isn't it.

143
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,380
So you can explore and at any point in time you can create.

144
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,950
You probably would need to.

145
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,420
You could probably look up this transaction somehow I guess

146
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,220
maybe we can try put it in here.

147
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,300
No.

148
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,700
All right.

149
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,360
So that didn't work like that.

150
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,660
Well I actually thought you could look them up here.

151
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,090
All right.

152
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,430
Well how can I look up a transaction see like that's supposed to work like that.

153
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,650
OK well no no worries.

154
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,050
So you can see how powerful that is that.

155
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,330
And you can see the whole concept in action.

156
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,320
So just feel free to go here and pick any blog.

157
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,060
If you take a look at all the blog you will see like a deeper blog you'll see there's more potential

158
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,620
to go through it.

159
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,460
And once again you just go into the blog you pick your transaction.

160
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,100
Look at that.

161
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,800
That's huge.

162
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,010
But this is not her not her recent book but anyway.

163
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,770
All right.

164
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:26,280
So you just pick a blog you pick your transaction on the header and then you click the chart and you

165
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,560
can have a look around and see how it was you know how it developed from there.

166
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,770
Once again if you take a deeper look then there will be more more to the tree.

167
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,790
All right so hope you enjoyed today's tutorial.

168
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,830
It is quite fun.

169
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,180
Now we know with that trend which is actually how transactions work what you take so are were fees come

170
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,660
from.

171
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,870
And in the next term we'll take that a step further and I look for it see you there.

172
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,710
Until then Jibla chance.
