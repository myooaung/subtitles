00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.880
Hello and welcome back to the course of blotching.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.380
And today we're going to talk about smart contracts.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.220
All right so what is a smart contract.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.590
What does it just for and how does it relate to Blodget.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.760
Well despite the name the smart contracts are actually programs which are run on the block chain.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
It's I know it might be a bit surprising that it's called the Smart contract.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.860
Well it's actually a program where when you think about it what's is a contract a contract is a set

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.020
of rules that or a set of clauses that parties agree on that govern the relationship between.

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.270
So it basically says that if this happens and this should happen if if the parties decide this and this

10
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.520
should happen after this this should happen so.

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.390
And essentially if you think about it then programs are the language that's the program speak the same

12
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
language so in programming you also define rules how the program operates.

13
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860
If this then that is that and this and so on.

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.440
And so it's it's not a surprise that smart tracks are actually code code that can go on the block.

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.660
Now we haven't spoken about code of the blocking before we've talked about many things that talk about

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.460
data on the blog share of stories about transactions on the blotching and things like that but code

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.190
the blocking sounds very very interesting and kind of very Skyfire like even how can you run code on

18
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.830
the block.

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.250
So let's talk about that a little bit more.

20
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.730
Well some of bitcoin in Bitcoin there's a programming language called Bitcoin's script and it actually

21
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.220
allows you to code things on the block.

22
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.800
At the same time in theory there's a programming language called solidity and illogical things for sure.

23
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.720
And for this tutorial for this section general the difference between the two will be a very important

24
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.710
component of our discussions or it's like ways the direction of our discussions why we going to be talking

25
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.370
mostly about solidity and ethereal.

26
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.480
Well the reason for that is Turing completeness of language.

27
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.570
The thing is that Bitcoin script is not Turing complete and solidity is Turing complete.

28
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.740
So now you might be asking what is Turing completeness What does that mean.

29
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.530
Well Turing completeness means that if a language is Turing complete that means you can code absolutely

30
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.480
any logic into that turing into that language.

31
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.740
So anything you can think of any logic you can think or write on a paper or having your mind you you

32
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.260
can code it into that language.

33
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.530
The how long it will take for that code to run is a different question.

34
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.920
It might take a few minutes it might take a few days might take a few years but that doesn't matter.

35
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.680
It's about this conceptual notion that you actually can code it.

36
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.590
It has all of the required elements to facilitate that logic.

37
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.880
Well why is Bitcoin's script not Turing complete and so it is complete all because it is because there

38
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.180
is one component that is missing a very important component and that component is called loops.

39
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.560
So loops if you're if you're familiar programming languages you know what loops are.

40
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.430
You know the for loop or the while loop that type of thing.

41
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.250
But if you're not familiar with programming languages it's basically a loop is a way for you to tell

42
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.810
the program to do a certain piece of code many times for many iterations.

43
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.370
It's either you might say do this five hundred times or do this a thousand times or it might say keep

44
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.940
doing this until a certain condition has been met and certain state has changed and then you know and

45
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.660
then stop or break.

46
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.380
And the reason is not because the script is not by accident it's intentional they didn't pull the script

47
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:56.010
because as a rule see for adult smart contracts or programs on watchings actually run on every single

48
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.600
node in the chain.

49
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.130
And they they can really slow the change down so somebody intentionally or unintentionally creates a

50
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.310
program that has for instance an infinite loop a loop that doesn't have an end.

51
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.700
It can destroy the whole block chain or it can hide the whole blocks and slow everything down.

52
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.250
Or even in an infinite loop just a big loop somebody might do like a very long loop a very tedious loop

53
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.720
and so loops in general are a in programming generally are a dangerous tool if they're used if they're

54
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.630
in the wrong hands or if they're used incorrectly and so to avoid any kind of problems and potential

55
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.040
problems with programs like running forever or going into infinite loops because script decided not

56
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.760
to include loops solidity on the other hand found a way to include loops and we'll we'll see how further

57
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.640
down in this part of the course.

58
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.910
And interesting note here is that I think I read somewhere one somewhere that I heard somewhere that

59
00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.120
the Hollywood Daryn was actually advocating for big conscript back in the day when before the theory

60
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.370
is Agard get over because crypto includes loops and make it complete because there's so much potential

61
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.210
for so many things you can actually create by coding or the bloodshed at the same time they didn't see

62
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.460
much of an update on that.

63
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.070
And so you went ahead and just created Theertham and solidity.

64
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.710
How interesting is that.

65
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.370
That's one of the reasons why we now have a theory and solidity and.

66
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.300
OK so let's have a look at this on a blockade.

67
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.670
So there is a block chain now a new blog gets added to the chain and instead of or in addition to writing

68
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.460
transactional data and other data we're adding a smart contract.

69
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.570
And so what does that mean.

70
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.770
That means that everybody in our network will actually have a copy of the smart contract.

71
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.710
So that's that's pretty crazy right.

72
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.790
So like one thing is to have some data copied onto machine.

73
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.070
Another whole thing is to have a computer program or you know a smart contract or program copied to

74
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.230
your machine which is right which will run there and everybody has a copy of it.

75
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:09.330
That's like it's very is an unfathomable concept and yet it is what happens.

76
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.880
And so each node has what has the history of all smart contracts.

77
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.690
So if there were any curious contracts they will be present on every note just because of the nature

78
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.520
of watching you get a copy of the blog change the whole logic gets copied every machine.

79
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.280
So that means all the smart contracts will be on every machine.

80
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.300
Will be a history of all transactions as we know.

81
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.210
So if there were any actions before the probably though there were tons and there will also we don't

82
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.780
ever know.

83
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.970
And also every node has to have the current state of all smart contracts.

84
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.070
What does that mean.

85
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.570
That means well the smart contracts their programs and they execute.

86
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.020
And so once you get in and you state and then they execute something happens you get into a new state

87
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.240
so every node will know in which state this word contract is the smart contract this is.

88
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.930
So there you go that's smart contracts.

89
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.000
In a nutshell I know it's like a lot to take in right away.

90
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.720
And so that's why we're going to like leave it here for now will continue further down.

91
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.620
And for at this point what I wanted to share with you is an example.

92
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.100
So here we have God's providence dot org slash white paper.

93
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.970
This is a white paper which is discusses how or explains how they're planning on using block chain in

94
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.720
supply chains to add transparency to supply chains.

95
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.950
And the reason for this the prayer the premise for this is that often like we biproduct said we don't

96
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.250
know where they come from.

97
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:46.180
Like you might buy coffee that you think is from Ethiopia but it actually comes from somewhere else

98
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:54.790
maybe you know just like like on a on a farm somewhere in your local country or somewhere where it's

99
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.710
cheaper to grow it.

100
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.890
But it's more reputable to say it's from Ethiopia.

101
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.340
So how can you tell it's from Ethiopia.

102
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.410
It might be a sticker but is that sticker valid.

103
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.030
Is that sticker a true sticker.

104
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:11.230
Anybody can stick a sticker onto a like a packet of coffee and that's not only to do with coffee that

105
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:20.740
has to do like pretty much any product that you purchase is this meat from a free range farm or is it

106
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.010
not from a free range farm is this.

107
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:23.530
I don't know.

108
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.640
Is this is it.

109
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:34.450
Are these clothes from a proper production factory or are these calls from a factory where they use

110
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:41.920
like like what is it called this sweat factory work where people are underpaid and you know they're

111
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.700
not treated well and they have to work lots of hours and so on.

112
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:55.150
So and So with that the idea is pretty solid to create a great transparency in supply chains and block

113
00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:01.960
chain as we know is a great way to do that is the prime kind of candidate for that because of its distributed

114
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.850
nature because tamperproof because it's so like it has all these amazing properties.

115
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.560
And so how would they do that.

116
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.840
They hear they explain well basically the same thing that we just discussed the brand premise for it

117
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.810
and here they have like a diagram which talks about what it is.

118
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:26.500
So we talk about certificates how they the certificates are issued right now certifiers what happens

119
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.010
today is there's a specific and that consumers don't have full visibility and don't have access to what

120
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.120
they want to create is as we can see this is our network you know and all of these tific is actually

121
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.080
still on the block chain.

122
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.570
Well to facilitate that they would use smart contracts smart contract would say.

123
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:51.010
OK so when the product is sourced in Ethiopia or let's say the coffee then and it's scanned with this

124
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:57.680
bar scanner if that happens then put this checkbox you know check this check box.

125
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:03.490
Then once it gets on the train check this check box once it gets on the ship check this checkbox every

126
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.100
time it's scanned because we have like the internet of things around there is so many scholars so many

127
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.450
checkpoints that actually can be digitized.

128
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.420
It's very easy for these things to be confirmed that it was physically scanned in this location and

129
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.110
the smart contract will have logic coded into it which would say you know if this then that if this

130
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.310
and that and it's not disputable this long it's like it's hard coded logic.

131
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.110
Nobody can come in and improve it.

132
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.170
It's a smart contract that's beautiful.

133
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.460
And now we can see why kind of can see you better why they're called smart controls.

134
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:45.690
Because at the end of the day it's like people or companies are interacting with it as a contract and

135
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.790
it's is treating this relationship as a contract.

136
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:55.080
So once certain conditions have been met certain things happen and at the end of the day the certificate

137
00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:03.060
is issued and you can go on line and you can have a look you know on your phone you know what like you

138
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.930
know like take a photo they had a good one here or something.

139
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:11.700
They're like take a photo and see you know see all of the details of where this product went through

140
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:19.200
what was happening along the way and get all the information and then you can be satisfied or dissatisfied

141
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.190
and purchase or not purchase said product.

142
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.970
So there we go that's an example of using a smart contract to disrupt a whole industry and which is

143
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.580
you know supply chains and create a lot of things there so that's prominence.

144
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:42.090
Then I also want to show you if you go to medium and you search for smart contract you will get a lot

145
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.750
of results.

146
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.980
So I look at the number of claps that means people are reading them.

147
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.390
So you got billed you for a smart contract before because smart contract language that compiles because.

148
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.160
Oh interesting.

149
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.890
So this is something for Bitcoin script smart contracts for Dummies.

150
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.960
Bill you first theory a smart contract with solidity.

151
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:07.740
You know like they are mostly for developers and they because people are actually coding on the block

152
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.070
chain.

153
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.530
It is the future is the next big thing.

154
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.360
And a lot of people are writing about this and helping each other out how to learn it.

155
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.990
So it is quite a popular topic.

156
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:24.020
It's really catching on and a lot of these are very recent like end of 2007 and I'm not sure you might

157
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.960
wish this video like like two years later so they might not be recent anymore but nevertheless smart

158
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.670
contracts are picking up.

159
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:38.710
And to finish off our additional reading for today I really liked this article smart contract for Dummies.

160
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.740
I enjoyed reading it.

161
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.740
I learned a few new things from it and got almost 2000 clouds.

162
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.940
Highly recommended.

163
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.050
Really good in the course description of course notes.

164
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.470
It's really funny.

165
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.040
I like how he describes smart contracts stones like as.

166
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.730
Let's set this in stone.

167
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:02.700
I love this phrase the phrase here like there's a reason we don't say let's put this in sand.

168
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.260
Soehardi.

169
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.880
So and then he has that example of a vending machine and so and so I highly recommend a very short article

170
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:20.220
but it will give you an additional perspective on smart contracts and show you how they work from a

171
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.260
different angle as a whole.

172
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.400
Kind of from a just.

173
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.590
Same thing different exploration.

174
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:24.990
All right.

175
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.940
So on that note.

176
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.580
Hope you enjoy this book.

177
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.680
See you next time.

178
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.570
And until then enjoy Lachance.
