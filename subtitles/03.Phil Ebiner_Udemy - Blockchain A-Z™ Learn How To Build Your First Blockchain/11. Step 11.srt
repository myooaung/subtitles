Hayes and welcome to this new tutorial in the previous Statoil we just made this first GET request to

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,710
mine a new block and now we're going to make a second GET request which will be to get the full block

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,530
chain displayed in our user interface postman.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:27,240
So we're going to do exactly the same as what we did for our mind block request meaning that we're going

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,600
to use the route decorator to specify the name of that request and more specifically the URL of this

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,880
request and to specify also that TO GET request.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,490
So that's why I'm copying this right now.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:48,220
I am pasting that here and here we just need to replace this name mind block by the name of our new

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,990
request and we're going to call this new request get change.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,900
As in we're going to get the food chain and this method is still going to be a GET request.

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,220
By the way you're going to understand much better the difference between a GET request and a POST request

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,870
in Mudgal to where we will introduce as well that POST request.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,570
But for now we only need to get request and that's exactly what our Get chain request is going to be.

14
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,630
All right and now exactly as we did before we were going to define a new function.

15
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,050
So I'm starting with Def and this function we're going to call it well get chain and same.

16
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,980
It doesn't take any argument.

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,910
We are ready to start defining it.

18
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,300
So it's going to be a much more simple function than the mind block function we made previously because

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,530
basically in this function we're just going to display the fool chain in our block chain.

20
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,860
And therefore what I'm going to do directly now it's going to look surprising but I'm directly going

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,840
to get my response variable which will contain what will be displayed when we send the get request when

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,940
we make that request you know the response that will Jayson ify same as we did before will contain this

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,610
whole block chain in the Jayson format.

24
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,100
All right.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,740
So I'm introducing here some brackets because we are going to input two keys and of course two values

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,880
and these two keys are going to be first the chain which will be nothing else than this chain list in

27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,610
our block chain object.

28
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,690
So in the end it functions as chain list is initialized as an empty list.

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,990
But of course you know when we mine some block with this mind block function that we get with the mind

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,040
block we quest.

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,810
Well this chain here is going to be populated with the blocks containing all their keys and we are going

32
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,640
to display in this response here all these blocks with all their keys.

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,210
So the response is going to be long but things to this change very well that will be populated.

34
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:04,770
Well we simply need to input here to change key and therefore here we are starting with the chain key

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,250
and the value of this key is simply going to be the chain of our blotching block chain the chain you

36
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,170
know block is our object.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,290
And from this object we get the chain attribute that is the chain variable.

38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,700
Perfect That will give us the whole chain displayed in this response.

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,070
And now we are just going to add something else which will be quite practical when our chain is getting

40
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,220
long very long.

41
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,930
It's the length of the chain.

42
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,630
You know we don't want to count the blocks in the whole chain when it's getting huge.

43
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,330
It would be quite practical to have the length of this chain displayed at the end of the response and

44
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,410
therefore I'm going to introduce here Nuki which will be in quotes length and that will be of course

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,940
the length of the chain.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
And how do we get exactly the length of this chain.

47
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:03,480
Well very simply we can use the len function inside which we input the chain of our block chains.

48
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,790
I'm just copying this and pasting it here and there we go.

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,840
We will get the length of our chain.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,920
Perfect.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,540
So that's our response.

52
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,280
That's it.

53
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,060
We were ready to return it in the Jayson format with same the HGP status code 200.

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,720
To tell that everything is OK and therefore I'm going to copy this right now.

55
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,130
Copy and paste it just below like this.

56
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,350
And there we go.

57
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,610
I have very exciting news for you now.

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,000
We are ready to start the demo.

59
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,400
We're going to do this in the next its oil.

60
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,990
I can't wait to show you this.

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,760
And until then and Joe bludgeons.
