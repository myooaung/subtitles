00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,870
Hello and welcome to part three of the blockade course very exciting part.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,620
We're going to talk about development finally we're going to talk about development and what changed.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,430
And we've got quite a massive journey ahead of us so let's look at the plan of attack how are we going

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,770
to tackle all of these tutorials.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,640
So in this section we will learn the following.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,040
Number one what is a theorem.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,950
A quick overview of what the whole general concept behind Ethereal is very exciting it's very powerful

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,970
and changing the world already as we speak.

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,630
They don't talk about what is a smart contract and we'll find out how they are used in blockades and

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,140
what exactly they mean for developers.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:57,880
Then we'll talk about decentralized applications on watching how applications can just exist on a block

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,300
chain rather than a centralized server.

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:07,410
And what that means again in the terms of development of these applications and programming them will

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,350
talk about in theory virtual machine and gas.

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,520
So how this infrastructure always theme actually works and what what's the purpose of ether at the end

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,540
of the day.

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,790
And you know that it's not just a cryptocurrency is not actually intended to be a cryptocurrency.

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,840
How this how these programs that we can write on block change how these applications that we can develop

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,500
are actually what the economy is behind it how they can run.

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,410
And at the same time not overload the network and be efficient and things like that.

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,210
They don't talk about decentralized autonomous organizations and that's an interesting tutorial about

22
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,180
how organizations might run in the future in a completely decentralized manner in fact in a completely

23
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,860
autonomous manner where they're just running there's no not no or not many humans operating organizations

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,700
and we'll see how that is possible but with the help of blotching In theory I'm not talking about the

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,970
Dow attack.

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:19,110
Interesting episode that happened in the life or the theorem when there was a massive hack and lots

27
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,700
of millions of dollars were stolen.

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,890
We'll talk about that and what implications that had on the network and how they recovered from that.

29
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,690
They will talk about soft and hard fork's what that means for a block chain network in general.

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,540
Look at some examples of that.

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,680
Will be two parts as a toil to this topic.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,190
The second is quite advanced so feel free to skip it it's a long tutorial.

33
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,320
Things over all were 15 minutes long and it is quite advanced.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
Feel free to skip it.

35
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,160
That's just the actual theory behind soft and hard force and how they work.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,250
But even the first part of that tutorial is sufficient to understand in a general sense what how those

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,290
things work.

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,300
They will talk about initial coding offering so slowly we are getting into the more financial aspects

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,000
of watching projects which are also important to consider and keep in mind when you are developing something

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,660
in the world of watching or where you're working on an application because this is kind of like the

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,770
end game or what you're aiming for and also we'll have a look at some examples.

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,420
So we'll talk about initial court offerings and how they work and how they're different to IPO or initial

43
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,370
public offerings.

44
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,890
Then we'll talk we'll have an IPO case study a hypothetical case study to show us even better how an

45
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:42,630
ICAO would work and what benefits it would bring and what kind of economy it would create for the project.

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,660
Then we'll talk about blocking startups will have a look at a couple of UPS we'll have a look at least

47
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:54,990
three examples of start ups in the space of bushing that I personally find interesting the ideas behind

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,970
them and in in one of these tutorials we're talking about investment advice financial advice.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,150
This is more for educational purposes and for understanding where to get ideas from how to find those

50
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,320
good projects that are using blotching in a way that makes sense and will specifically talk about white

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,270
papers and porters and white papers where to find them and what they mean for blocking projects and

52
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:25,400
what they mean for you as a as a developer or as a professional that is going to be using Guangcheng

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,390
in the future.

54
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,650
And finally we'll talk about.

55
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,660
We'll conclude by talking about washing and where three point old what role block chain will most likely

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:46,730
play in Web 3.0 or is is slated to play in the Web 2.0 that's coming our way in the next couple of years.

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,190
So there we go that's our plan for the section as you can see quite a lot of details to tackle.

58
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,800
So we're going to be fun and lots of different information and very very excited to jump straight into

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,060
it.

60
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,070
So hard for you.

61
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,650
Let's dive into your and I would call you on next tutorial Until then introductions.
