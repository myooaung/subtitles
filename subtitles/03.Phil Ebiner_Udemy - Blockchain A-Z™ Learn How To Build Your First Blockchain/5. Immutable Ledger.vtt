00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.540
Hello welcome back to the course on blotching.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.050
So there's got an exciting tutorial going to be talking about the immutable léger property of blockades.

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.050
All right so here's our map and previously we spoke about cryptography and so we can check that off.

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.990
And today moving on to the immutable Ledger.

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.410
So what is the immutable laser.

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.630
Well to start off let's have a look at where we left off last hour.

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.680
This is where we left off.

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.630
We discuss that in a block chain.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Blocks are cryptographically linked together and that's where the chain is actually formed.

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.490
And we discussed how that works.

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.940
So today let's look at an example.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.060
Let's say you want to go and buy a house.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.350
And so you have money might be a pile of cash or most likely just money in the bank and then you take

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.090
that money and you go and pay for your dream home.

15
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.250
So what do you get in exchange in exchange you actually get the home.

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.920
But how do you know that you have the home.

17
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.260
How do how can you prove to someone else that that's your home.

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
Like why can't you just go up to any house on the street and say that that's your home.

19
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.650
Well because in exchange for that money what you get is a deed a title deed to the house and whoever

20
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.810
has the deed is the owner of the home.

21
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.840
So what you need to do the deed is you need to take it to a government authority such as a local council

22
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.730
or the city council or some other authority to them they might differ.

23
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.580
So there it is.

24
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.320
You take the deed there and you register your ownership you show them the deed and you say this is now

25
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.330
my house I paid money for it.

26
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.580
And I would like to register that it is my home.

27
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.400
So that's like a simplified explanation of what happens I'm not an expert in property.

28
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.170
So there might be some experts listening to this and I'd be laughing at how miserable this is.

29
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.180
But this drives the point home you need to register your ownership with the local authority.

30
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.110
And so how do they register.

31
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.420
Well usually they write it down in the ledger but usually they always write it down in a ledger and

32
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.650
in some cases some modern governments more modern governments they use digital ledgers.

33
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.500
But the interesting thing is and I was very surprised to learn this myself that still a huge percentage

34
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.380
of governments especially in not like not in the first world countries and third world countries they

35
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.970
still use written letters.

36
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.710
So actual physical books and in fact not not just in all countries even in first world countries in

37
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:54.230
many cases it's still a physical book like a notepad with numerate pages where people just write down

38
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.790
who owns what and then what it's about once it runs out they put into the archives they get a new one

39
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.290
and then they start a new page and so on.

40
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.380
And so as you can imagine this this is it.

41
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.500
This is all you have you you have the title deed which you know you need to hope to keep safe that you

42
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.660
will lose it or you will burn somewhere and you have this little tiny entry in a book somewhere in a

43
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.980
building that belongs to the government where it says you own the house.

44
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.140
What if that building burns down or what if somebody steals that book or what if somebody wants to come

45
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.070
along and hack that book.

46
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.450
And we don't even have to use the word hack because it's a book.

47
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.010
They just go in and they're about the page and they glue in a different page where everything is the

48
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.300
same except for your entry which they changed.

49
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.680
And then what does that mean.

50
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.360
Well that means that all of a sudden you don't have the house anymore like physically you might still

51
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.140
be living in the house and you might think it's yours.

52
00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:03.320
But in reality just because that one line of information has been erased from a book somewhere in the

53
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.050
government authority all of a sudden you don't actually have the house and it's even if it's not a book

54
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.980
even if it's an electronic document like an Excel spreadsheet.

55
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.800
How difficult is it for somebody to go into an Excel spreadsheet and just change one line.

56
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.720
So it's very easy still.

57
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.920
Right so.

58
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:30.090
And in fact a lot of people actually live like that a lot like they are tons and tons of errors in property

59
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.820
title type property titles in like in these databases and people live in their home they think they

60
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.510
have the home.

61
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.000
But in reality it's actually not theirs anymore just because of some error or some somebody messing

62
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.120
up a fuss.

63
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.200
So now comes into college watching how can we fix this situation.

64
00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:01.550
Well let's say we have all of these titles stored in a block chain rather than on the paper or in a

65
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.480
Excel spreadsheet or a database.

66
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.250
Let's say we have them so every single title every time somebody buys something or sells a house it's

67
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.830
a new blog that's added to this chain and it's even OK that we're not even talking about distributing

68
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.790
decentralise.

69
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.440
Yet this whole block chain can be stored like very simplistically like in that govern facility even

70
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.570
that's really better.

71
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.150
And so every time you can see like we've really there's already been some transactions in this block

72
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.460
chain and then it's your turn.

73
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.630
You buy a house.

74
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.350
And so you add in each transaction and then a couple of months the months pass by or a couple of years

75
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.400
pass by and then somebody comes along and decides to take your home away from you by tampering with

76
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.510
the data in the block.

77
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.280
And they also realize that home and they want to report that page of the book but they get into the

78
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.920
facility and they see that it's actually not a book.

79
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.900
It's a whole block chain.

80
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.590
OK.

81
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.360
So that's you know that's a challenge but might be solvable.

82
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:07.300
But what's happened in those past couple of months or years is that more property transactions have

83
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.950
happened so people bought properties or sold properties and all of those are also record in the ledger.

84
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.300
And now so if this person tries to tamper with the data in that specific block then what happens is

85
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.550
that will change the hash of this block.

86
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.600
And what that means is this cryptographic link will no longer work because the hash here is different

87
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.980
to the hash recorded here for the previous block so we have the previous year the field previous hash

88
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.900
it will no longer match this one.

89
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.350
So this person would have to change this lock as well.

90
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.600
But as soon as they change this blog this blog called match this one and they have to change this one

91
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.910
as well.

92
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.040
And as soon as they change it this one or this one and so on so because of this cryptographically.

93
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.830
As soon as they change one block all of the blocks after that will no longer be valid they will longer

94
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.270
be connected to the chain.

95
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.710
It would be very easy to tell that very hard for the person to tamper with the record.

96
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.110
So unlike in the book where they can just change one entry here they would have to change the all of

97
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.780
the entries following yours.

98
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.490
And that's what we mean when we say that it's an immutable nature because you cannot change data as

99
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.680
soon as data has gone into the box.

100
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.050
It's very very difficult like at this stage we can see it's very difficult and that's when we just have

101
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.190
the block installed in this government authority.

102
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.760
Well we talked about peer to peer distributed networks.

103
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:36.460
You'll see that it's practically impossible to change a single block in the chain simply because the

104
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.660
way it's structured because more and more components are added.

105
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:46.090
So the longer the more time passes the harder it becomes to change and eventually becomes practically

106
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.550
impossible.

107
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.760
OK so that's what I mean an immutable Ledger is.

108
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.160
And I also wanted to point out here that this is not just an example pulled out of air.

109
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:04.560
This is one of the biggest coded examples of property Leger's is one of the biggest examples.

110
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:12.130
When people talk about blushing outside of finance outside of Bitcoin outside of other coins and crypto

111
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.320
currencies and CEOs and things like that why is it such a big example.

112
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:25.670
Well to start off with this whole problem of lechers right that these layers are so like archaic it's

113
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.370
so unreliable to keep information there.

114
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.530
And here's some other fun facts.

115
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.590
For example remember when the financial crisis that we had in 2008.

116
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:49.150
Well Bank of America was going to places like you know close mortgages for foreclosures and because

117
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.230
this is so unreliable.

118
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:57.670
They actually ended up coming to properties where they didn't actually have a mortgage they hadn't made

119
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:03.730
a mortgage given a mortgage the person or the the business for that property and they tried to foreclose

120
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.860
properties which they had no right to foreclose simply because how bad these ledgers are.

121
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.800
Another example is in height in Haiti or tight tight.

122
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:21.780
Well basically in entirety it's practically impossible to know whose property you're living on who which

123
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.020
property belongs to whom because of all of the natural disasters they have there.

124
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.070
Like all of these hurricanes that come through and you know just wipe out not just the properties but

125
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.020
like the government facilities and all of these ledgers unfortunately get destroyed.

126
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.620
And so it's really impossible to tell for many properties who actually belongs to what the historical

127
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.920
transactions were of that.

128
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:52.330
And plus on top of that like with any government there can be corruption there can be other factors

129
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.770
that influence that.

130
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.850
And so is it it is become a huge problem there.

131
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:04.660
Another example is that the world bank estimates that about 70 percent of the population of the world

132
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.090
don't have access to proper titles and to proper facilities that can register titles and title deeds

133
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.680
and that's also of course in third world countries.

134
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:23.090
But still that's that's a huge problem that's the problem that blotching can solve that this to console

135
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.780
and Tryphena shovel won't give you one example.

136
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.770
One more example.

137
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:33.730
This is an example from the U.K. So it's directly from the government of the U.K. website.

138
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:40.660
This is how many transactions so property and this is not commercial property this is private property

139
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.860
transactions that are residential property transactions that happen in the UK per month.

140
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.990
So you can see there's a there's the blues the values and the red is the seasonally adjusted so about

141
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.640
100000 transactions per month happen in the UK.

142
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.470
And I know you'll say you'll say what if these are like tiny transactions you know somebody paid you

143
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.730
know 10 pounds here and there.

144
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:10.190
Well no actually this data is for transactions that are £40000 or above only.

145
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.040
So only the only thing that's above £40000 went into this data set.

146
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:22.150
So as you can imagine hundred 100000 transactions per month which what does that make it.

147
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:30.250
That's hot that's about 3000 just over 3000 transactions per day or a hundred and forty of transactions

148
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.920
per hour.

149
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:37.020
Or if you even do it further it's like one transaction every SEC every 30 seconds so this tutorials

150
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.750
been going on for like almost 10 minutes I was hearing.

151
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:47.200
And so like in the time that we've been talking here 20 transactions have happened in the U.K. for 40000

152
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.260
pounds and about.

153
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.360
So can you imagine like 3000 transactions being recorded into these ledgers every single day.

154
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.240
Inevitably they are going to be errors somewhere.

155
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.700
And that means you know people's title deeds titles are not going to be recorded properly and that can

156
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.840
cause issues down the track and that can all be solved with technology with block chain.

157
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:18.470
And that's why governments are considering moving things like their title deeds management to block

158
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:18.790
change.

159
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.800
And I think that's one of the first places we'll see that happen.

160
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.050
And it's not only about Title these this can also be applied to things like diamonds.

161
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.400
That's another big use case you know because with diamonds you also need to track who boarded where

162
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.610
it came from who sold it and all the transactions related to it.

163
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.110
So you can see what's happening.

164
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:42.680
So like physical tracking of assets wherever we are currently using ledgers this we can move to blocking.

165
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.240
So there we go that's an immutable ledger and those are the benefits some use cases.

166
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.830
I've got a great article for you for today.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:15.520
