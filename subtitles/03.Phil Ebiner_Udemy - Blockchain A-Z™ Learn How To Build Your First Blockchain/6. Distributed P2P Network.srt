00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,150
Hello welcome back to the course on the blog today we're talking about distributed peer to peer networks.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,490
All right.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,410
So previously we've already talked about the cryptography.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,250
Check that one off.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,000
We've checked off immutable litter previously as well.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,590
And now we're moving on to distributed P2P networks.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,370
So let's have a look.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:33,970
We left off last time when we discussed the example of property Leger's the traditional approach versus

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:42,370
the block chain approach and how the blotching can add more protection and make the whole lÃ©ger immutable.

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,010
Make it very difficult for somebody to change previous records in the laser and therefore make it more

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,750
reliable.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,870
However the question here is OK well if I'm trying to attack this later if I'm trying to make some change.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,970
Yes indeed preassumed Previously it was just about ripping out a page or making like a change in a database

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,690
or Excel document which was very simplistic compared to the blotching approach but nevertheless even

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,450
in the block chain approach if this block chain is maintained just by this government authority then

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,500
what prevents me from going in and if I have enough time then actually changing this blog and then changing

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,000
this blogging business and this.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,200
After all if we're talking about a property that might be worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,590
it might be worth while for somebody to actually put in the effort to change the blog here.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,040
Replace their your name with their name and then the hash will be updated and then they will change

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,110
this hash and this and this and this and this and so on.

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,600
So what prevents them from doing it or on the other hand.

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,690
What what also happens if for example there is some system error.

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:03,820
And so for example this blog is not maliciously changed but just through some somebodies input error

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,350
or something else you we're going to put in a new blog at the end Blotz by accident.

26
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,800
They went into this ledger and they just actually changed the value in this block and indeed the cryptographically

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,640
will be broken.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,610
I will see that there is a problem but we'll never be able to restore the previous date.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,120
Right.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,900
It's even though we can see that there's a problem.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
How will we restore the data.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,400
So those kind of to equate those are two questions.

33
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,790
On one hand somebody can come in and actually spend the time to change all the blocks in the system

34
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,690
to forge the ledger even though it takes some time but might be worth it for them.

35
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,970
On the other hand this something might happen in the middle of the chain just accidentally some data

36
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,650
might be lost because then it is just like a block chain is an open ledger if anybody can just go in

37
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,080
there and see the file just like it like an Excel spreadsheet or databases that it's links like this

38
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,190
so it's harder to change or will see if there's a change.

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,560
But at the same time it's not that it is right protected.

40
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,370
You can go in and change this and if that accidently somehow happens then how do we restore that data

41
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,030
from the original data set.

42
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,070
So this is the problem is that a distributed peer to peer networks.

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,530
So.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
So let's have a look.

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,520
So in a distributed PDB system we've got lots of computers and they're all interconnected.

46
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,870
Ideally the more they're connected the better.

47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,650
But of course you can't we can't possibly connected to be connected to everybody at the same time in

48
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,830
some like further computers away are going to be connected a bit less to each other and so on.

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,590
But through the network everybody is interconnected.

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,870
And so in this scenario once we do have the block chain how like how does this affect the plot and how

51
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,630
can we use this.

52
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,420
How is this used in Blodgett's.

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,990
Well the blotching is actually copied across all of those computer.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,100
So let's think about our example the properties instead of just keeping it on one system.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,270
In that government computer it's actually copied across thousands and thousands of computers here we

56
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,800
only have six computers in our example but it can be actually thousands of computers or even millions

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,180
of computers just laptops of people or computers personal computers.

58
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,140
Like literally it could be on your computer or it could be on my computer.

59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,840
That exact government ledger of all the transactions.

60
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,680
And of course it wouldn't have names in it.

61
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,070
Everything would be connected through cryptographic keys and say things like that which we'll talk more

62
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,800
about in the coming months of course so you can't get to the actual names of the people without knowing

63
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,510
that it will be just through their identifiers.

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,740
But nevertheless all of this information about all the transactions on everybody's computer and anybody

65
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,800
can on their own computer change this information if they like or you know just not change if they don't

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,100
want to just just keep the chain updating being updated on their computer.

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,630
So that's what happens so that that's how the Blash is distribute.

68
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,870
I know it sounds pretty pretty crazy that like a laser of property transactions would be distributed

69
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,060
across peers like just you and me just normal people.

70
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,610
But nevertheless let's have a look.

71
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,440
Let's go.

72
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,450
Go with this example.

73
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,460
So once in your block is added.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,830
What happens is that information is communicated throughout the network and that block is added further

75
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,440
and further throughout the network until all of the computers have this block.

76
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,460
And that might take some time especially in large pro-capitalist boxes.

77
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,870
So in this case is the house that we purchased so we can see it's now copied onto all of the networks.

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:52,990
And then what happens is let's say some time passes as an obvious example three months or a few years

79
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,490
and more transactions are added to the block.

80
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,430
And a similar amount and now the problem is.

81
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:07,240
So somebody tries to hack our entry or or there's like an error that has been made to the entry Well

82
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,680
let go of the hacking example because both of them will have the same solution.

83
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,630
So somebody comes along and tries to maliciously attack our entry and take away our house.

84
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,160
And so we're going to present this with a black square once they've successfully changed the entry.

85
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,740
This is what it looks like but at the same time as soon as they do that we know that the cryptographic

86
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:33,310
links between the blocks will cause a problem for them because now all of these blocks after that walk

87
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,650
are all of the sudden invalid and they need to go through all of them.

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,760
And as we discussed maybe it is worthwhile for them to go through all of them and actually change the

89
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,730
hashes in those blocks recalculate the hash of each book one at a time and rerecord them and put the

90
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,800
new information.

91
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,930
So they might go ahead and do it and they're successful and they've changed this block.

92
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,070
So in the previous example before we had distributed peer to peer networks that would have been the

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,440
end they would have succeeded they would have succeeded and it would have taken away that million dollar

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,590
or a hundred thousand dollar property.

95
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:14,410
But in distributing peer to peer networks what happens is they are all sink top very constantly.

96
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,530
The network is constantly checking.

97
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,870
That's how this system is designed.

98
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,820
The block she calls the checking their peers to see if their blogs match up.

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,080
And so instantly these peers would see that there's a problem that's there.

100
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,030
BLOCK change doesn't match up to this block and they would signal to the blotching on that computer

101
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:41,460
saying hey look just like a computer or so against the other a look at your blog Sze seems wrong compared

102
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,330
to us and that's a shame on the rise of the blockade which was hacked.

103
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:54,320
You will notice that it is in the minority that the majority of auctions are all that are in consensus.

104
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,630
They have the same Barshay which is different to the one it has.

105
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,580
And that means it will understand that it's been hacked and what will happen automatically is that these

106
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,660
values.

107
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:14,020
Now where are we these values will see that these values are different and these values will be copied

108
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,460
over.

109
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:21,340
So just very quickly all these values will be copied over and the block chain will be just restored

110
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,590
to its original value.

111
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:31,330
So what happens in this case is as you can as you can see the hacker cannot just attack one computer

112
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,860
and just attack one block change and change change the values there.

113
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,000
The hacker will have to attack all of the block chains and at the same time.

114
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,910
So by attacking this one even even if it takes them like that they would have to do that operation very

115
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,040
quickly in a matter of you know few seconds or maximum or a couple of minutes depending on the blocking

116
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,350
structure.

117
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,180
Once they do that it gets replaced.

118
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,660
Right.

119
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,610
But so even if they see if they're taking a while to do it it will all get fixed even before they get

120
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,130
to the end.

121
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,130
But now to successfully attack they actually have to attack Well not all of the piers they have to take

122
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:15,880
more than 50 percent of the computers at the same time in order to replace them so successfully replace

123
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:16,930
the chain.

124
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,060
So if there are attacks we've got six computers that have to check for if they take one two three for

125
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:27,670
these computers at the same time and replace these blogs to recalculate this blog and then recalculate

126
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,860
the hash for this block and that and then replace it in all of these computers at the same time then

127
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,780
then that could take over the network.

128
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,740
That's the only way you can break into a block chain.

129
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,280
And so the more you have computers the more Piers you have an abortion the harder it is if you have

130
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,130
ten thousand computers you would have to hack into 5000 computers 5000 in one computers at the same

131
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,290
time and do it within a couple of minutes and probably a couple of you know less than a minute or depending

132
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:56,810
on the blushing.

133
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,310
Yes.

134
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,880
Couple of minutes maximum and that's practically impossible.

135
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,790
That's where the additional security comes from.

136
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,370
And that also illustrates the point that it doesn't really matter that this blockade is sitting on my

137
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:09,720
computer.

138
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,530
So this might be me blush saying I could do it as long as I can't get any personal details from the

139
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:21,040
action of the people there is long as they were presented by their identifiers rather than their names

140
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,420
and addresses and things like that as long as that sounds were presented then it doesn't matter because

141
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,570
even if I computer if I tried to accidentally or maliciously change something on this blotching then

142
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,230
the seminar will happen.

143
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,030
It will just auto update itself and I'll have the new file and that's it.

144
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,590
And I'd like my hands are tied.

145
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,040
No one person can do anything.

146
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,690
And so that's how we bring trust into a trust Listen wire.

147
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,730
And so and then they like if we don't know each other.

148
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,630
Anybody in these in this chain we don't trust each other but because we have the majority this majority

149
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:08,800
consensus situation because of that we can trust each other the technology set up the technology design

150
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,750
brings trust into this trust trustfulness framework and allows us to transact each other.

151
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:21,100
That's the beauty of pure distributed peer to peer networks in watching and that's as you can see that

152
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,500
adds an extra level of security.

153
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,120
So we had hash cryptography that's that was one level security.

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,070
Now we've got that peer to peer networks and other level of security.

155
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,790
And as we will see in the consensus protocol and other things there's more and more layers of security

156
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,290
that make location's so powerful.

157
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,180
So yeah there we go.

158
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,600
Everything's good.

159
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,380
Watching is back to normal.

160
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,550
All right so I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial.

161
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,710
And today we've got some additional reading.

162
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,710
Very interesting article by Vitaly terrine the founder of therian.

163
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,540
So we'll learn more about Retallack in module 3 of course.

164
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,960
But for now here's a good intro to get acquainted with him.

165
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:07,570
The article is called the meaning of decentralization and you may have heard some debate around the

166
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:14,590
difference between decentralization and distribute decentralized systems and distributed systems.

167
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,630
And so Vitalii really puts it all to rest.

168
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,370
He shows his understanding of different three levels of centralization.

169
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:28,300
Decentralization so logical externalization political decentralization architectural decentralization.

170
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,470
Very interesting read.

171
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,170
I highly recommend checking it out and also will help you combat any kind of debates you might have

172
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,170
of someone when they're saying no this is our distributer.

173
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:44,260
This is decentralise or no this is not the centralizes is distributed and this will give you some additional

174
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,870
overview of what's going on there.

175
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,040
All right and on that note we're going to wrap up.

176
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,330
I'll see you next step.

177
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,250
And until then enjoy fluxions.
