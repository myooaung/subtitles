00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.210
We are here to discuss like coin an important point in the realm of crypto currencies.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm sure some of you are already familiar with it.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
For those of you're not we're going to get into the establishment of like coin and some recent information

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.450
related to it.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:23.550
So let's just jump right into it like coin is actually seen as the silver or copper two big coins gold

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.780
due to its similarities and it was released in 2011 after it's launched in 2011 it became the second

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.820
most popular currency but did run into some trouble in 2015.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.250
It had a bit of a tough time with undermind acceptance due to a Chinese like coin Ponzi scheme.

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.330
And we could see that as a bit of a negative but we can also see that in May 2000 18 compatibility with

11
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.000
block net protocol was adapted for like coin.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910
And again we're going to get into that in a moment.

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.440
Keep that in mind because there is a big positive for like going to we can go a little further into

14
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.290
the establishment.

15
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.480
We know it was released in 2011 and it's open source so that it's not managed by any central authority

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:20.070
the like coin network went live a few days later after its release and was a fork of the Bitcoin client.

17
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.860
And although it's seen as the copper or silver to Bitcoin because it's almost identical to Bitcoin.

18
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.460
It does have some differences such as a decreased block generation time and increased max number of

19
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.900
coins and uses a different hash algorithm and modified GeoEye.

20
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.870
And we can think that the decreased time in the realm of crypto currencies.

21
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.270
If you have the decreased time the quicker transaction time and a decreased transaction cost.

22
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.930
Those are huge elements in the realm of crypto currencies like coin was setting out to try and conquer

23
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.850
that or at least establish that as a competitor.

24
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.890
In the realm of crypto we always want at least on the user side the decreased transaction costs so it's

25
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.350
more beneficial to us and a faster time as well.

26
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.460
Some interesting notes with light coin is it actually became the first of the top five by market cap

27
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.650
crypto currencies to adopt a Segway.

28
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.110
And in 2017 it also became the first lightning network transaction completed through light coin transfer

29
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.300
like going from Zurich to San Francisco in under one second.

30
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.880
Now that's pretty impressive.

31
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.370
And we get into transactions the cost of transactions or with like going around one fiftieth of the

32
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.750
size and with like one we also have that faster transaction time and crypto users see light coin as

33
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.900
more stable because the pricey acts more rationally and that's always great if you're looking to invest

34
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.520
into something you would kind of want something to behave more rationally.

35
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.030
Kind of helps with the prediction of it.

36
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:05.330
So what also helps is that there can only ever be 84 million like coins with almost $56 million already

37
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.460
released.

38
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.610
Now this is seen as a positive because having a fixed amount can help verse inflation unlike hard currencies

39
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.050
such as the dollar or the euro because we all are familiar with inflation related to those currencies.

40
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.470
So it can be seen as a more sustainable currency long term.

41
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.180
And an important note of like coin again we mentioned earlier that problem that Lycoming had with the

42
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.280
undermind acceptance in 2015 due to a Chinese Lycoming Ponzi scheme.

43
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.160
But this news is fantastic for like coins.

44
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.540
And this happened in May of 2008 with the compatibility of Blochman.

45
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.330
And for those of you who are not familiar with Blochman block it is a system that allows investors and

46
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.120
cryptocurrency users to exchange virtual currencies without the intervention of a third party.

47
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.840
The process is completed via atomic swaps meaning that anyone who has fiat or other cryptocurrency can

48
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.750
easily exchange it for like coin without having to rely on third parties.

49
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.140
And that's huge in the realm of cryptocurrency as well not having to rely on third parties being able

50
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.940
to swap and exchange like coin for other crypto currencies.

51
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.060
The adaption and compatibility of block that a big plus for like coin.

52
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.570
So for those of you who are looking to invest into it or for those of you who have had it and have already

53
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.760
invested into like going this is some great news.

54
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.910
Also on a side note if you're looking to integrate like coin and you can visit the following page here

55
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.560
and see the information related to integrated like.

56
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.150
And it's pretty easy because as we've mentioned it's got such similarities to Bitcoin and it has full

57
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.700
compatibility with the Bitcoin API.

58
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.790
It's pretty easy to integrate into existing applications that already offer Bitcoin support.

59
00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.780
You can find information as a developer using bitcoin as a merchant and as a business that already supports.

60
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.530
Like when you can actually register your site here just a great feature to see options on the coin on

61
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.580
the currencies page for offering integration with the currency.

62
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.150
All right.

63
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.520
We can see Vasser transactions that point initially set out to accomplish.

64
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.480
We could see that the Max Light point is being mind daily with every two and a half minutes a block

65
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.710
being mind that generates fourteen thousand four hundred light points daily.

66
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:38.570
As with all crypto it's becoming much more relevant as merchants and institutions adopt their use for

67
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.540
services like coin is gaining traction with some recent merchants accepting it.

68
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.180
So try to keep it on your radar for the remainder of 2018 and 2019.

69
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.990
And again with the compatibility of block net I think we're going to see it consistently grow.

70
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.370
We're going to see that undermind acceptance from the Chinese like coin Ponzi scheme in 2015.

71
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.080
I don't think that's going to be so much of an issue with the compatibility of block net.

72
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.180
Definitely and to help related to that factor and light point.

73
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.920
So try to keep it on your radar.

74
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.420
If you have any questions please feel free to share them in the Q&amp;A.

75
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.640
And with that enjoy cryptocurrency.
