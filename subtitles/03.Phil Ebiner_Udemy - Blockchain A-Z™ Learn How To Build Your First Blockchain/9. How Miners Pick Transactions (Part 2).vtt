00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.290
So this blog and call me again.

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.630
And what did I want to look at.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.740
All right.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740
So let's look at transactions per block.

5
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.930
Interesting chart here.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.510
Again this is if you go to the right and you go to charts.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.470
So transactions per block this is for the past year you can see that it's sitting at around 2000 So

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.350
this is 2000.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.280
You can actually do like a seven day average here doesn't really help anyway.

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.260
So you can see that it's it's about 2000 right now it's dropped to 1000 300.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.550
So yeah that's the transactions per block and that indeed can vary because of the size of each individual

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.120
transaction.

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.880
So if transactions grow in size the sample of the year that we have here.

14
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.940
So it kind of goes up and down but that really depends on the individual size in terms of megabytes

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.480
or kilobytes per transaction.

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.690
Now if we look at charts again and we go and look at the different one we look at average block size.

17
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.010
So that should be more or less consistent because the Maximum block size is one megabyte like one megabyte

18
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.550
or so sequences one zero point zero or five.

19
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.100
So more or less all the time.

20
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.430
This chart should be around 1 megabytes.

21
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.070
You know sometimes things happen I guess but it doesn't go like up to 2 megabytes or like you know down

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280
to consistently half a megabyte.

23
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.000
It's always around 1 megabyte.

24
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.400
And that's because minors generally you know like want to maximize the usage of that block because they

25
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.010
don't want to leave it half empty.

26
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.360
They want to put in as much as they can in order to get as many fees as possible when they can.

27
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.180
And speaking of fees is another interesting show here total transaction fees.

28
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.690
So this is total value of transaction fees paid to minors not including the coin base value look or

29
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.870
what.

30
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.100
So basically not including any new bitcoins that are generated for creating the block itself.

31
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.150
And so you can see here this is in U.S. dollars.

32
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.350
Interesting.

33
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.330
So you can see here that this is how much minors are actually getting in terms of fees in the past year.

34
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.960
They're earning it while you can see here in December 2017 they earned in one day in one day.

35
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.240
The miners earn 22 million dollars in fees.

36
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.330
How crazy is that.

37
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:49.780
And just recently yesterday they earned $400000 in fees but the reason here is there's two is twofold.

38
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.360
First one is demand.

39
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.020
Of course if people want to push transactions into the network into the blotching then they have to

40
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.560
like there's a lot of demand a lot of people want to have their transactions go through the list there's

41
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.190
only so much that he can take right.

42
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.530
There's only one megabyte per block of transactions that can be included.

43
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.930
So therefore people have to specify higher fees.

44
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.860
You know like when there's a lot of demand for people putting in their transactions whoever has the

45
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.490
highest specifies the highest fees when so that drives the fees up.

46
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.200
It's like a supply and demand economy.

47
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.970
And when there's not that much going on that people don't like there's not that many transactions that

48
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.710
need to go through.

49
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.090
People are not in a rush.

50
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.320
Are those two factors then the fees go down.

51
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.000
But the other thing is that this is in use the not in BTC I'm not sure why they actually did it and

52
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.080
it was D rather than in BTC because this is affected by the exchange rate.

53
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.830
Right so we know that in December Bitcoin was like the highest ever and then kind of dropped off a little

54
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.360
bit I think like Bitcoin was like almost to or around $20000 per bitcoin back then so you know like

55
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.760
if you convert this back to Bitcoin it won't be as chaotic.

56
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.100
It will be more more stable.

57
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.420
So that's another thing to keep in mind.

58
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.880
So there you go.

59
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.750
That's that's those are the stats.

60
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.110
There is a lot more charts here that that can be useful.

61
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.880
So I will look around if you haven't yet and maybe you'll find you know this cost of Paso's action will

62
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.320
cost purchase action different different shows that you might see someone pool but we'll talk more about

63
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.700
meme pool later on.

64
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.240
There's actual rate how many transactions I suppose this might be interesting how many transactions

65
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.390
are added to the pool per second.

66
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.680
So this is the speed at which transactions are being added You can see it's kind of like it's interesting

67
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.970
the seasonal looks like maybe it was on a season or this is like because this is tweenie I guess this

68
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.730
is per.

69
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.830
This is time of day.

70
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.760
You like I think this is the time of day or something like that.

71
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.640
So the drop is about 4:00 p.m. 4:00 p.m. or P.M..

72
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.430
And also I'm not sure what time which which system time using 6:39 my time.

73
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.320
OK.

74
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.850
So it looks like it's my time.

75
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.370
So Australia time maybe has the time difference of America because America Americans like waking up

76
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.060
now I guess anyway.

77
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.840
So interesting stuff.

78
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.910
Interesting charts.

79
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.080
Have a look around.

80
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.840
Another interesting another thing I wanted to show you is if you go to BTC dot com there's a transaction

81
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.540
an accelerator.

82
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.650
So this is like am I going to remember my nipples have these transactional accelerators.

83
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.880
Remember we said that Zeshan could get stuck.

84
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.530
So if that happens you can go to a transaction accelerator and you put in transaction hash and then

85
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.580
they'll tell you how much it will cost you for them to accelerate your transaction meaning that here

86
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.390
it says that there's a 75 percent chance that it will be pushed through within the first hour and there's

87
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.700
a 98 percent chance within four hours so it's a common issue and they actually make money of it that

88
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.530
they're like we have we're in a mining pool.

89
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.080
We have the power to choose which transaction is going first and which transaction go and last.

90
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.010
And so we're going to you know like if you want us to prioritize your transaction then you know pay

91
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.950
up basically pay up and we'll put it through for you.

92
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.540
OK.

93
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.340
So that's the transaction accelerator.

94
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.550
And finally to finish off today I had some additional reading for you.

95
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.850
It's a simple article nothing nothing too complex.

96
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.770
How bitcoin mining works but we've already covered quite a lot of things.

97
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.970
And it talks about no solely a positive economic difficulty.

98
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.110
So it's a very short article but if you want to kind of like recap on your knowledge from a third source

99
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.840
just see if you if you have any if you like you by now you should be able to understand every single

100
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.000
thing in this article.

101
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.660
It should be.

102
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.910
No no no holes as far as I can see from here.

103
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.650
Oh you have all the knowledge to understand this whole article including what we discussed today miners

104
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.910
keep trying but with a different block configuration so I wanted to give you this article earlier on.

105
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.900
But then they had this comment in it and I didn't want it to be confusing but now you should be able

106
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.950
to understand everything.

107
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.940
So if you want to try it out how Bitcoin mining works and I'm going to ask and billing link will be

108
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.710
of course in the course course notes.

109
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.180
Yeah.

110
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.490
So just a good way to confirm your knowledge on that note.

111
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.230
Thank you so much for being here today and I'll wait to see you next time.

112
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.120
Until then enjoy bludgeons.
