00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.150
Hello all come back to the course and blog check.

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.960
Today we talk about segregated witness segment.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.210
You may have heard this term and today we're going to get a brief overview of what it's all about.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.800
We're going to go into the technical details behind it but briefly we'll discuss what Stigwood is all

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.900
about why it's important.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.610
And so that's your you're prepared for these conversations if you ever need to have.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.340
All right so let's have a look.

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.730
This is our block and block.

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.720
Five hundred thousand one hundred twelve.

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.430
It's just a made up look of course.

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.890
And as you can see it's got quite a few things inside.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.100
This blog is got the block number time stamp non-SS previous hash hash.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.360
And so there's actually a couple of other things and all of those are called the block head are combined

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.960
because they are not the transactions they're not the actual content they are just like something that

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.800
goes along with the block additional information whereas the transaction that's the main body of the

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.120
transactions.

17
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.940
So in Bitcoin there's a limit there's a limit to one megabyte for the size of a block.

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.590
And this was included in the original design.

19
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.170
There's the speculations about the reasons for that and probably one of the main ones is that if you

20
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.130
have a block size which is too small then you don't have.

21
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.530
You can't include too many transactions in it and therefore you're going to have like a lot of bad like

22
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.280
bad with problems and network people are going to be waiting for too long to do the transactions.

23
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.820
On the other hand if you make the block size too large then the network is going to be slow because

24
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.770
this remember the whole Ledger has to be shared with the whole network everybody has to have a copy

25
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.820
of the block chain.

26
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.290
And therefore whenever a new bloke comes along we could be told that computers around the world.

27
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.650
And if it's too large then that will take a lot of times it was like a 100 megabyte block that'll take

28
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.110
a lot of time for it to go through a network and that means there's going to be more chances of orphaned

29
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.500
blocks more chances of competing chance and more chances for attackers to take advantage of the block

30
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.220
chain and check and do something because information is propagating so slowly and they have more time

31
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.810
to do that.

32
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.690
So the middle ground was decided to be one megabyte.

33
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.130
But we've been around the block.

34
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.760
The big question is did confliction has been working ok good with it but recently it's been like towards

35
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.840
like people I've been noticing like last year in 2017 Peter and noticing that it's been slow slow and

36
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.270
sometimes it be transactional black backlogs.

37
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.880
So they try to solve the problem how can we solve this problem.

38
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.740
How can we get more bandwidth in the network.

39
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.950
And there's a couple of options as approach of a hard fork and a self-forgetful talk football or more

40
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.800
about forks in module three of the course.

41
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:13.220
Well the hard fork that was proposed was to increase the block size and the soft fork was set to read

42
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.330
weakness and so there's two different approaches and basically the hard fork.

43
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.470
Eventually that's that's what resulted in Bitcoin cash that we see now.

44
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.970
But we will talk again we'll talk about that more and more with three the self-focus segregate witness

45
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.940
and what does that be.

46
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.700
Well so far because like an upgrade to how the block works which is not compulsory for everybody to

47
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.290
take on board right away it can prove it can propagate over the network of time and people can accept

48
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.130
it slowly.

49
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.700
So it's easier on the network that way.

50
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.600
And so what segregate witness does is it looks at the contents of an individual transaction.

51
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.010
So here's our transaction.

52
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.850
And as we discussed previously and this is why this fits in involved here because now we know about

53
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.160
transactions not only how they work but actually we know about signatures and public keys and private

54
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
keys and verifications and things like that.

55
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.690
And so we know that it actually is not as simple as just the head or the number of the transaction it's

56
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.880
actually got more to it.

57
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.710
It's got though of course the from to an amount.

58
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.330
That's that's the main reason for the transaction.

59
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.310
We need to know who we want to add to the chain.

60
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.920
Who's sending whom money and how much money they're sending.

61
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.550
But also for security purposes we cannot just include that information.

62
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.400
We can't just put their names there.

63
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:44.070
We have to put their addresses and also we need to put a signature on a public key.

64
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.650
We need to attach our signature and our public key to the transaction.

65
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:56.010
And the reason for that is because we need people we need the notes to be able to be able to verify

66
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.100
who has signed the transaction and has it been signed by the person who actually holds the private key

67
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:10.540
behind that and this is all good and well but the issue is that the signature public has as we could

68
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.990
see there huge numbers transactions don't necessarily have to be that large it's just you know one address

69
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.850
another other address the amount whereas a signature you can see is like a massive hexadecimal number.

70
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.760
And the public is also a massive exodus of lumber.

71
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:35.410
So they end up taking up to 60 percent of the whole transaction size and yet they're not the main purpose

72
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.180
of the transaction.

73
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:43.950
They're just a another way for verification a security mechanism but they take up so much space.

74
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.540
So what was proposed was to take this part of the message this heavy part which is also called the script

75
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.290
sig and remove it from the message strip it out of the message and send it as its own through its own

76
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.310
messaging service.

77
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.430
And on the network.

78
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.380
So it will still be linked to each block any action but it will go through the network separately and

79
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.450
that way we save some space that way each one of these transactions reduces substantially in size and

80
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.270
we can fit in more transactions.

81
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.650
And the key thing here is that you might hear that the SEC would increase it increased because the sequel

82
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.340
was adopted by the blocking network in on the 24th of August 2017.

83
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:33.960
And slowly it started seeing more and more nodes uptake SEGUI type of blocks being sent around.

84
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.800
And so.

85
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.440
And last thing is because the self-organize is backward compatible meaning that even nodes that didn't

86
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.060
accept SEGUI they still participate and everything is working fine.

87
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.640
So you what you might here is that you might hear that SEGUI increased the block size two to four megabytes.

88
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.340
Well that's not true.

89
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.870
That's not.

90
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.740
Well the the way to think about it it's technically it's not true that block size is still one megabyte

91
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.070
it's not going to change.

92
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.660
It requires a hard work to change that.

93
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.950
And as a result you end up with something like Bitcoin cash like you might have a split in the network

94
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.740
will be if you want that to happen again we'll talk about forks further down the course but if that's

95
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.960
not something that you can change easily it's still one megabyte what people mean when they say that

96
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.260
the block size increased and I'm loading in quotation marks with my fingers.

97
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.660
The blocks has increased two megabytes is what they're saying is that now you can include where you

98
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.090
could include previously you limited to one megabyte of transaction of data.

99
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.660
Now you can include a lot more data which feels like two megabytes of data right.

100
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.660
Feels like two megabytes.

101
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.610
But at the same time you just because these things are getting stripped and it's about 60 percent.

102
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.630
So even more you can even include a bit more than what it feels like to people say I could get up to

103
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.650
4 megabytes.

104
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:05.340
But the point is they can comparison to what you had previously if you're including X transactions previously

105
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.110
Now you can include like more than 2 x transactions.

106
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.860
So it's as if you're including two megabytes of data block.

107
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.930
But in reality this part is getting stripped out and it's being said separately so in the end you're

108
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.530
just ending up with still one megabyte of data in the block.

109
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.130
Just more transactions.

110
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.160
So there we go that's that's how sick with the old like a general overview of Cygwin.

111
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.060
So you know what it is.

112
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:33.190
Oh and by the way why is it called segway because I witness this data you know witness is a synonym

113
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.860
is uses synonym for signatures so it's a segregated signature.

114
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.750
You can say that but says sig I guess doesn't sound that great.

115
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.690
So segregated witness is mean is that you're segregating.

116
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:52.290
This block is segregating the script segue into its own messaging channel.

117
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.710
That's why it's called segment.

118
00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.880
And you know hopefully now you're prepared for these conversations a bit a bit more information about

119
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.830
how the current block change how a big card Bitcoin blotching search by the way it's not just Bitcoin.

120
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:11.810
There's a couple of other cryptocurrency like light Cohen who use SEGUI because it increases network

121
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:21.010
throughput it increases speed and the bottom line here is that Bitcoin and block change gripped currencies

122
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.460
have great advantages.

123
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.960
But one of the main disadvantages is that they're slow is that they can only throughput or slow like

124
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.420
Bitcoin right now is about like 10 transactions per second if you average it out whereas things like

125
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:41.020
Visa and MasterCard they go up to tens and hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

126
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.040
As you as we know everybody's using cars.

127
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.540
So they have a massive throughput.

128
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:53.650
So if Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are going to compete with players like that then they have to solve

129
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.470
problems of latency.

130
00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:01.750
All of that more latency is throughput throughput probably isn't so good as one step towards that but

131
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.580
there's lots more steps to be taken.

132
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:12.130
This for decisions to be made in the future of Bitcoin and other currencies in order for them to have

133
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:19.480
that throughput that that will become be like that can compete with what we have with the banking system

134
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.650
that we have right now.

135
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.020
So there we go.

136
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:29.650
Hope that makes it a bit clear I would say it is for additional reading I'll redirect you to the legendary

137
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.220
as we call him Jimmy song.

138
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.060
So Jimmy song is a developer who developer of blockade.

139
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.050
I think maybe in bitcoin.

140
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:45.720
Not sure about that last part but basically he has like I haven't read that many things from doing so

141
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.430
but they are quite well written.

142
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:56.770
And also I've heard quite a lot of people say good things about him and that's like a lot of influencers

143
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:03.590
in the space of cryptocurrency always kind of reference Jimmy song for his knowledge for you know the

144
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.050
things that he shares and they say listen to Jimi's song.

145
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.450
He knows what he's talking about.

146
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.640
So he's got an article on medium called Understanding Stigwood blog size.

147
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:23.680
I will say it like his style is not very like is is is a bit technical so it's not completely simple

148
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.670
so you will find it's not that easy overread.

149
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:33.810
It's not like extremely programming and technical but he uses terms that that might be quite to Archigram.

150
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.270
So be prepared for that.

151
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:41.250
But at the same time it does explain a bit more details about Cygwin than what we have here.

152
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.240
But even though even what we had here is enough to get you started on the desexing with this is if you

153
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.200
want to go to more technical things and understand like exactly how or more closely how things will

154
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.700
work work in that technical side of the chain.

155
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.410
All right.

156
00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.130
So there we go.

157
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.700
That's us for today.

158
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.650
Hope you enjoyed the Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you back here next hour.

159
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.710
