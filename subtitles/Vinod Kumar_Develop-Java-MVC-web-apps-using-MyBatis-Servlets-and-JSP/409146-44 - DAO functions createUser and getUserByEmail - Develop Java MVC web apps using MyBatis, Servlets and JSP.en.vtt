00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
in this lecture.

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.340
Let's address the deal layer for the registration model before we actually write the deal

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.090
functions.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.760
We need to make a change in the mappers list here.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.190
So because we copied this from the previous project,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.340
I forgot toe change The class names over here on the map of classes return.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.630
Nothing but interfaces need to be mentioned.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.790
And this was related to the previous project,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.010
not the current project.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.720
The current project has to deal into faces.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.240
Contact deal on user deal on that package Name is a little different than the one that is

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.990
mentioned over here.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.930
Let's change that.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.590
So it's gonna be cold out.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.990
We know dot phone book dot deal dot contact deal on then user do you?

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:52.570
So let's copy Onda face the same thing and changed the 2nd 1 toe user dio just to gratify

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.850
if everything is OK,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.770
move the cursor on these class names,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.310
but using the command on back and control on other laptops so you can see that it's showing

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.970
me a hyperlink,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.170
which means everything is okay.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.140
Let's say the file and then goto user deal.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.800
That's where we need to write the actual functionalities There are two functions required

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.860
for the decision.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.890
Model number one is for validation purpose.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.250
We want to send an email and check if the user exists by the demon.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.750
The other one is toe.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.530
Actually add a new record for the given user object.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.430
Typically did are divided into two sections.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.640
One is the crowd operations on the 2nd 1 is going to be quite.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
Is Onda the first function?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.430
Let's adjust the quality public user.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.650
We'll call it us.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.350
Get user by email on then we supply the email over here,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.630
and this has to be mad to an SQL select statement using a Did it select annotation again

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.900
from my buddies,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.070
A.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.540
P A.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.040
And the select Statement is gonna be like this select star from users were email equals toe

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.030
hash in college bracket,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.550
the perimeter that we are receiving like this.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.350
But one small problem is that the Venice,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.330
a select star from users,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.950
the user stable has a column called Created Underscore it.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.390
But as user has a field without understood,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.390
we abused camel caps for that.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.790
So if you go over here,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.850
you can see there they create at,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.670
but as here in the Davis Cup dollar.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.190
Still,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.140
it says here,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.350
created at.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.660
So let's also fix this problem.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.050
I believe there's a spelling mistake.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.810
Let's make it has created at Save this.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.840
Come back over here Now we need to say that,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.000
Hey,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880
the result brings a column.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.390
We don't have a mapping corresponding to that because the column name and field names are

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.900
different.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.480
We map it by using something called Under it.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.650
Results on the results is a on a day off one arm or result because there may be multiple

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.400
column names missing the map ings in the corresponding class.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.940
So we can say here,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.480
curly bracket activated.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.170
Result singular.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.260
And then we have no say What is the name off the column on Name off the property in the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.800
object So we can see here that the column is nothing but created underscore at on the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.650
property in the object that correspond to the same thing is going to be created at like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.080
this.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.090
Now let's are the second function,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.920
which is going to be the crowd operation.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.400
So here is where we want toe.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.880
Create a new user ricard for a given user,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.310
object on for the Let's call the function.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.550
Er's public wide create user are new user and the argument is going to be user user.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.880
This is supposed to be mad using the underrate insert,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.770
the command is going to be insert in tow.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.280
Users remember the user idea that'll gendered it.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.820
So we have to skip that.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.710
So which means we have to give the rest of them in bracket over here on the columns that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.940
we're interested in,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.670
adding right now is going to be name.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.030
He made boss word Onda.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.160
Also the created act So we'll see here created underscore at values is now going to be

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.000
picked up from this object,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.660
and we need to give using similares in tax.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.570
Let me full screen the user deal and then I come here and then in bracket.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.220
I have to say hash and then name coming from that entity.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:46.630
Hash email coming from the entity hash password and one lost his hash created at using

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.600
camel caps and then a bracket for the values on.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.440
This would actually add a new record in the U the stable,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.300
but the back and is also going to take the responsibility of automatically incriminating

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.730
the i D but we wondered,

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.700
I need to be automatically set toe this user also by default.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.580
That doesn't happen.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.210
We have to explicitly add an annotation toe.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.550
Tell my buddies that Hey,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.440
whatever the I d generated in the back in has to be fetched and also should be sent to the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.250
i d properly of the user object.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.120
And this is done by using options.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.480
An addition and the options is having a bunch of elements.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.920
So if you press control space here,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.750
you can see all the options.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.670
One of them is used generated Keast.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.300
That is the one that we want on you should simply say true.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.710
And what is the property that correspond to the idea in?

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.250
The users are here to stay here.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.220
He property equals toe i d.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.630
I didn't get the key column is different in the table.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.010
You can also say Key COLUMN Nichols toe water,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.510
the name of the column in the table.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.170
And since the column name is saying,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.080
we don't have to really do anything over here,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.000
So this completes the deal.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.050
Will air correspondent toe our registration model,

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.740
but before concluding,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.520
will take a look at the user.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.140
Also here there are two things that we may want Toe address number one is the password.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.590
Remember,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.920
this is the string the user enters a value for past for that has to be encrypted and stored

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.580
in the database table.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.470
It should not be stored as is.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.800
But that is the responsibility off the service layer.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.950
Because the service layer is taking care of all the business that you can encrypting the

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.850
password in the business logic functionality.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.170
The 2nd 1 is the clear did act Andi.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.230
Whenever an object off this is created in the memory,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.830
we're gonna pass it back to the ideal dealers goingto instantly save it in the levy.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.580
So which means that when the object is created,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.520
the time off creation is what actually we need so again simply assign a value here saying

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.620
that new date so that we don't have to worry about passing the value,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.870
are setting the value for this field.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.980
We can also provide one customize the constructor that takes these three parameters so that

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.550
it becomes easy for salaries layer to create an object quickly.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.880
For that,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.160
I'm gonna go over here and then say source generate constructor using fields on.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.680
I want to select only name email passwords.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.600
I'll untech idee and created at Gender it.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.580
And now we can see we got a constructor that takes the three perimeters on.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.060
Of course,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.850
we also have a no argument constructor anyways,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:35.600
so let's say all the files by pressing command shift S R controlled shift as on Windows on

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.600
.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.950
That's all for this lecture.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.070
In the next lecture,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.730
let's build our salaries layer on top of this deal Earlier.
