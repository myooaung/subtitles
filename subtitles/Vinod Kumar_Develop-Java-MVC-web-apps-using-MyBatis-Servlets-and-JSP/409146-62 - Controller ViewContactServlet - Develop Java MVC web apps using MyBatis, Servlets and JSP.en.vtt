00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
in this lecture.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.610
Let's create a controller on map.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.330
It toe this Ural pattern so that when you add a contact successfully,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.570
you will be able tow.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.090
Review the details of the contract that you have added.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.690
So let's go to the package right click and say,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.490
New Class named the class as view contact starlet that they're super close as http starlet

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.490
.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.740
Click finish at the Did it Web Sublet an addition and map it toe.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.820
Ah,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.140
you other patent view Contact details That's at the default cereal person.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.200
You I d for good practice.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.230
Get it off this comment on Let's all right the do get because response don't send redirect

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.980
always makes it get request.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.180
Also,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.310
it is possible that we may give a hyperlink somewhere so that clicking on a contact will

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.250
show you the details of the contract.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.900
Let's get it off these two lines.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.460
This duke,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.240
it is going to be very simple because all we have to do is toe get the input from the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.110
request object,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.490
which is not the i d.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.260
I have to assume that there is going to be a choir resting perimeter called idee.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.890
As you can see in the sunlit.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.820
We're making a request here with a question mark.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.450
Heidi equals to an I D,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.870
and we need to receive the diary.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.820
So let's try the way.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.510
Do that.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.430
String input equals toe request art.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.610
Get perimeter off idee are responsible that the user might not have type the idea at all.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.880
In case if the user is typing the euro request in the address bar directly,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.920
in which case input is going to be No,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.270
I can straightaway say,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.560
if input equals to know,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.440
Maybe we can simply redirect the user back to the home page,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.200
so their response don't send redirect to dot,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.370
slash and then say written.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.220
But if there is an input,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.300
let's convert that into an indigent.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.040
Because I leave.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.820
They're supposed to be into just to do that.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.450
Let's say in Teacher Islay equals toe new integer off input.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.680
There is a possibility that the user might have passed a non numerical values,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.560
especially if the user is attempting to in all of this tablet from the address bar,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.760
in which case this throws a number former exception,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.030
which will be for the throne away from this particular function and eventually it will

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.640
reach Tomcat and dunk.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.820
It will collect their exception and then render the factories to the user.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.160
We will have a look into that.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.680
But instead of putting that in a try,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.090
catch and handling that here there is a simpler method.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.310
Because these kind off exceptions are possible from many sellers,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.450
we can centralize the exception handling mechanism.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.140
But assuming that idea is okay,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.920
it's a number.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.440
Now we need to make use of the service that we wrote in the previous lecture and then

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.110
collect the contact object storage in the request cope on,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.350
then forward the request toe our chase.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.530
To do that,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.730
let's a contact service service equals toe new contacts,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.200
terrorists.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.450
And then we say contact C equals tow service.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.590
Start get contact by I D.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.100
And then supply this idea.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.230
Contact needs to be imported from our entity package and I press command shift or to do the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.740
same thing.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.500
Now,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.040
in this case,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.430
see,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.250
maybe no,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.480
maybe a valued contact object.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.180
We don't have to worry about that here,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.590
but in the view we can check if C is now,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.090
we can just tell that hey,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.150
there is no contact for the given idee But you see is not equal sternal.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.370
Let's displayed er details in the ninth HTML format.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.290
So I'll have to do is to say,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.420
request are set,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.690
attribute and then the attribute name.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.650
Maybe I'll give it us contact,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.570
but the object I'm storing is see on one final thing that we have to do is tow forward the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.360
request to a JSP,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.000
which we don't have as off now.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.550
So that's a request dot Get request dispatcher slash web enough slash views slash Let's

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.480
call it as show contact dot jsp And then we say dot forward request and rest once as

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.330
parameters on our controller is also really don't living that is now missing.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.590
Is the show contact or GSP?

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.430
In the next lecture?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.750
Let's finish that also.
