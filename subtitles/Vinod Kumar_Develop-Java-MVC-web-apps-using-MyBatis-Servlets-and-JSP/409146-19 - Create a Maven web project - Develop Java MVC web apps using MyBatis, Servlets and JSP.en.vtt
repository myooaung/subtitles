00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
in this lecture.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.370
Let's see how to create a new May 1 bad project and deploy the same thing on this

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.320
particular server.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.180
To do that,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.730
let's Goto file new May 1 project as Asian.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.750
Let's click on the Create Simple Project by skipping the architect selection.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.650
Click on next,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.430
the group I d.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.240
I'm gonna give it us Korda,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.730
we note,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.470
because my website is we know Darko Artifact Ready?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.350
Let's give it us sublet demo.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.600
Importantly,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.790
you need to give the packaging us war washstand for them archives.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.150
So that's what we want toe create.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.250
You can give name and description optionally,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.950
and if you have a parent project we can give you don't have any of those click on finish

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.360
toe.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.340
Come out off this and as soon as you see that the project is created,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.750
you may also see an editor.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.970
And if you click on that on,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.570
go to the markers view over here,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.150
it will tell you what is the actual era.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.650
It is May 1 Java e con figuration.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.170
One problem.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.950
If I expand that it is web dot XML is missing and then it is Failan missing web dot XML or

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.750
Web maximal is turned on to truth.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.930
So basically it is that your project must have a web dot XML.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.380
If I on,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.650
we don't have one here.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.470
If you extend the SRC,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.330
you'll see that there is a main,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.200
expanded guilty Java resources.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.750
With that,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.390
so inside this about it expects a VEB a and a slash web dot XML fight,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880
and we don't have one.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.350
That's why it is giving an add up.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.950
We'll fix this problem in a minute.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.330
But before that,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.260
there is another problem that we have the address,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.030
which is the washing off java that Nayman project has taken.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.820
So if I goto project properties and then look in tow Jolla,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.570
build part libraries,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.350
you'll see that the jury system library has taken Jato SC one about five.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.920
I can change this in two ways.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.260
The number one way is if I double click on,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.060
then choose Jolla,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.380
SC wondered age,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.150
click on finish and then apply enclosed that would actually do the job.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.260
However,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.710
each time I do a May 1 update,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.680
the portion will be reset toe under fire.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.270
To avoid that problem,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.820
that's goto com dot xml I a May 1 compiler plugging over here,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.150
so I'm gonna just increase the phone,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.950
stays a bit,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.140
and then I'd hear a section called Build inside the building.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.650
We're gonna add plug ins,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.700
and the plug ins is florals.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.130
That means it's gonna contain one or more plug ins.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.120
So I'm gonna one plug in right now for May 1 Compiler begin artifact.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.380
Really?

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.450
That were toe use is May 1 compiler plugging,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.750
and this has got a configuration,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.040
and the configuration has two options.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.050
Number one with a source wondered Pete on then the target is one that beat,

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.650
Let's say this and do a maven abd it by right click on the project.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.750
May 1 update project I take on Okay.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.530
And now,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.370
if I goto Project co produced and then under job build part libraries,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.410
we can see that it has updated toe Java and C Wonder eight automatically.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.330
Let's cancel this and let's add the web dot xml file by right click on our project.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.770
There is a Java ee tools,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.720
and it tastes your gender.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.610
It deployment descriptor stub,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.350
which is nothing more developed or XML.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.810
Let's click on that.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.390
You can see that it has gender did have folder called Grab Enough.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.200
And inside that folder we have a file called Directional.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.350
Let's also create a home page for our project by Aisling,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.850
an index shortage female under weather.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.210
You can either lately conv ever are you convey.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.050
Click on the project and then say new HTML file.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.230
You can see that automatically about four there is selected.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.080
Let's type index as the name dot html will be automatically taken.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.650
I can click on next.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.890
It has automatically chosen the HTML fight template.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:34.050
Let's click finish And we do have a very simple HTML file exchanges to sell it on JST demo

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.930
That's had a hitch.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:46.050
One same thing sunlit jsp demo probably HR and I'm gonna give you a paragraph that says

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.770
Created by my name slash So I'm gonna save this.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.970
Not that our server is not started.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.060
It has been stopped here and there is no projects Lister under this particular dunk it What

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.500
I have to do now is to right click on this project and then say Rana's run on Sarwar Since

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm doing this for the first time,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.600
eclipses gonna prompt with sir what you want to use.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.410
I have only one so that is automatically selected over here.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.720
And we can enable the stick market that is always use this server when running this project

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.720
.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.860
Because I'm not gonna add any more servers over here.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.770
Click on Next note is that it has automatically taken the project suddenly dash Demo Over

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.930
here I take on finish and now it is going toe create a war file out of my project and then

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.460
deploys onto the tongue.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.930
Cuts work directly,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.150
which happens to be in our work straight itself.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:54.320
Let's click on finish and now you can see it has opened the you are within eclipse itself

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.250
in the previous lecture.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.620
I sure where that option is their toe change This from internal brother to an external

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.150
brother.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.820
I did not choose that.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.350
So I goto window and then save Web browser I select Default System Web browser.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.930
I close this now and then,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.450
right click on the project.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.380
Roundness around.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.050
Answer one.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.950
This time you'll see that it opens in the default brother,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.220
which happens to be chrome.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.050
In my case,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.990
if you want to see where exactly the project has been deployed,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:35.180
we can go toe a new finder window or Windows Explorer in case of Microsoft windows and go

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.850
toe desktop.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.550
This is my training workspace.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.000
You can see that there are two projects,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.480
or here.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.830
Number one is the servers project that actually came up when we configure Tomcat.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.800
And there is a 2nd 1 which is called several demo,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.580
which is the that project I created just now.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.330
There are other folders here which are actually invisible.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.680
Right now,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.240
there are hidden folders,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.710
toe get into the he didn't folder.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.890
What?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.340
I'll do that.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:08.750
Copy this part and then open a new terminal and then city in tow That location.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.280
And if you see here,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.280
ls minus l I C only those two.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.500
But if I say unless minus L A,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.550
you'll see that there is a folder called Meta Data,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.850
so I will get into that meta data folder.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.070
Under that,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.120
there is a folder called Plug Ins again.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.410
It's hidden for those serving started their dot.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.880
So I go in tow the plug ins folder,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.990
and now I will say open that location so you will see that it comes up with a window

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.950
consisting off all the files.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.640
Let's have a look at that now so you can see under training workspace that the dark matter

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.170
later dot plug ins and I have to know Look into the plug in that is responsible for the Web

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.750
servers,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.630
which is our dark eclipsed or wst dart Sarwar call.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.940
So if I select that,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.050
you will see that there is an interest called PM P zero.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.650
So if your country getting multiple servers,

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.250
you'll see folders like PM P zero TMP one TMP toe etcetera.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.410
I click on this TMP zero.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:14.510
Now you can see that there is a bunch of folders that represent like work folders off your

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.160
project.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.760
So here is the wtp wraps.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.670
This wtp ribs consist off your projects that you're deployed,

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.040
they click on that.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.350
You should see that there is a folder called Subtler Demo which is nothing but the exploded

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.680
washing off the war file.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.940
So if I click here,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:37.250
you'll see that there is an index html medallion f verba enough And then you have Vettel

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.830
XML.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.250
You also have classes that actually doesn't contain anything.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.700
But if you have a job class that compiled wash not that would be over here.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.410
Similarly,

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.450
if you have any additional jobs,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.760
they'll be automatically another folder called Live Here,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.650
consisting off on the job fights.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.730
That's all for this lecture.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.000
In the next lecture,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.850
let's create our first separate class.
