00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
let me make a copy off this particular file to customers by ID's Anglo Press Command.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.890
See,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.100
and then command V on Windows Control C and Control Be.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.400
It will say that Hey there the name conflict.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.810
But give it a different names.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.820
I'm gonna type your update.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.580
Customer data,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.690
I'd say.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.250
OK,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.690
and now we have this new five year update.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.400
Customer data.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.780
Let's open the same Onda.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.650
We have returned the customer record.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.980
Let's change this back to,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.300
let's say,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.240
for example,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.820
three.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.590
So three.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.750
The valued customer.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.200
Let's check it out by running the cold.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.430
So it is.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.460
James City is Bang Glor.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.500
Let's say we want to change the value of City from Bangla Toe Dallas on.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.790
Since this is the one that is being printed,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.610
let's just go and change the customers City by typing C one dot set city toe Dallas and now

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.740
we can change any other values.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.270
Also,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.930
if you want,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.520
for example,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.530
against a C one dot said phone number is,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.200
let's say,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.900
for example,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.500
55523411 to 2 Onda.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.860
Now,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.070
if I want to update this back to the database table,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.250
we simply have to say.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.360
Delwar dot update customer see one notice The name on email remained the same.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.730
Whatever.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.880
That was their NC one when we're itude ID,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200
so we will now try to retrieve it and then print it again.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.570
So this is before updating and we want to print after updating.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.790
Maybe I can say you're before updating plus C one on a similar output I want to give,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.180
but I have to retrieve it once again on then I have to say here after updating,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.160
this is the data.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.570
So let's change this to after updating Save this,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.960
Let's go on down the same So after a daring idee name remained the same city has been

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.200
changed to the last email remains The same phone number has also been updated,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.600
but we also want to see if it has been updated in the back and also off course this time.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.360
Because in our deal factory,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.900
we already have said that it has toe automatically commit the transactions we should know.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.160
See that James Rickards should be changed from Bangla toe Dallas.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.050
That's people and run button over here and you can see it has been updated toe Dallas on a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.650
new phone number over here
