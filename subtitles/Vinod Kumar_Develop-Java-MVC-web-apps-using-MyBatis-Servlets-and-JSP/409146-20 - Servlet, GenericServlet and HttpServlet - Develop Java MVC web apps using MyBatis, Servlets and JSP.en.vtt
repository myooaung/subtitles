00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
sunlight is the core off any Java Web applications.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.630
As a developer,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.400
you and I cleared a class which is qualified at the summit on then a Web container.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.010
Like a party,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.080
Tonka will instance shit and manage its life cycle.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.020
In order for a class to qualify as a sublet,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.950
it must implement the subtler interface from Java extracts omelet package.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.910
This interface has fire mental signatures unit salaries destroy,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.910
which are considered as lifecycle matters on the two additional functions,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
which are getters called Get seller in four and get seller conflict.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.860
When your application is deployed onto a Web container such as Apache,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.410
dunk it,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.600
it reads.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.530
All the information about the application,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.110
either from the web dot xml are from an additions off all the classes phoned in the class

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.400
spot.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.690
If the Web container comes across a separate plus,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.310
it creates an object off the same and then calls its innit metal.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.580
They need mattered,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.350
receives an instance off sunlight conflict containing some country information about the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.920
sunlit,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.850
such as innit parameters.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.930
In our solar it we have to store this contract object as a member variable and then

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.770
returned the same where the gets alert conflict minted.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.480
This matter is usually required by the Web container Onda women ever use it at all.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.530
Once the salad is instance,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.030
created and initialized,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.970
it is religious.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.090
Are any extended?

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.830
Declined requests on the requests are handled by the service Life cycle matter.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.350
So whenever the client makes a request to a particular sunlit,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.390
the Web container create objects off,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.850
submit,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
request insulin response and passes them to the service mattered off.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.350
Other sunlit object.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.910
This is where we have to handle the client requests and produce an appropriate its GDP

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.640
response.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.260
The teller lifecycle method,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.660
which is called destroying,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.660
gets executed by the Web container when the summer is being removed from the container,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.540
which generally happens when the application is being shut down but gets are waiting for.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.790
My third is expected to return a string representing a small piece of information about the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.290
summit,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.640
which is usually used by admin.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.670
Consoles toe display information about all the subjects that have been loaded into the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.260
container.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.640
The Saturday Pierre provides that class called Generates Tablet,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.120
which implements the solid interface.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.210
The gender excellent class implements all the methods from the sunrail interface except the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.020
service matter.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.260
So instead off our class,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.070
implementing all methods of their salary into face.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.780
By extending the genetics alert class now our class,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
we have to implement only the salaries method which is abstract.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.900
The rest of the contract,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.390
mentored from solid interface,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.880
have some appropriate ONDA meaningful court in the gender color class.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.020
The salary pay also provides a class called its GDP sunlit,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.560
which inherit from gender excel it.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.170
This class implements the contract service matter as well.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.280
Apart from the contracts Airways Mitter,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.810
it also provides different variants off the service method.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.300
Nor did the do functions which intento handle the corresponding.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.450
It's too deep emitters,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.660
for example,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.050
that do get method is invoked when the client makes an http get request on the do posted in

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.150
world when the client makes hits TTP post request.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.370
So the most common approach to create a summer class is toe extend.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.810
Http Select class on overrate,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.020
one of the Duma thirds.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.010
As for a requirement when a quaint makes a request,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.050
the Web container in works the contract salaries mattered on our solid object,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.960
which then converts the perimeters in tow,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.150
their ex TDP abortions and in walk another sarees minted president.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.450
But https alert Plus this second sarees matter checks the X GDP method used by the client,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.910
such as Get our post and then in walks the corresponding do mattered,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.860
such as do,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.200
get or do post.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.770
So in our summer class,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.260
we must forward a specific do function in orderto handle a specific http method.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.340
Otherwise the Web container response with an adult court 405 indicating the subtler does

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.850
not handle such a request.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.100
Here is an example of a typical separate class.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.360
The salaries method in this case,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.230
the do get mattered has two parameters supplied by the container.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.530
The 1st 1 is hit studio.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.730
The seller's request,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.390
which has access to everything that the client has sent.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.120
This includes the request perimeters,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.710
headers,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.180
cookies,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.720
etcetera.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.990
The second perimeter is off type http response which has access to an output stream so that

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.750
we can write our HTML response to the client.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.520
So,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.410
using a request,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.130
we can read all input from the user and using response,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.790
we can give our HTML content to the client before writing any content of the client,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:59.100
we must set the mind type off our output mine is an acronym for multipurpose Internet mail

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.760
Extension,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.870
which only describe what kind of data that we are giving is a HTML.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.090
Is that a CSE,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.800
or is it a binary later,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.420
like a Pdf etcetera?

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.990
Here's how you can set the mind type.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.130
You call the set content and function on the response object and supply the appropriate

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.900
mind type.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.350
Using the Xdd presented responds object.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.110
We can get an output stream,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.740
which may be a character stream or a binary stream.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.630
Most of the time we want to read a text to content.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.540
So in order to get a character output stream,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.970
we can simply call response toward get greater function with irritant.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.320
An instance off print.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.760
Traitor.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.210
We can use any of the print or print Eleanor print off methods provided by the print

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.050
traitor toe gender Door response.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.050
Make sure you close the writer object.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.230
Otherwise,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.990
the client may not get the actually steamer content because they're all buffered output

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.450
streams.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.940
In the next lecture,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.450
let's create our first solid class
