00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
in this lecture,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.130
let's create a controller sublet that can give list of contact details to the user.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.880
First,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.080
let's go to the head,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.530
RJ SPF And for a long day,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.110
Newser,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.350
let's forward an option toe.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.180
View the details off all the context that he or she has on.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.880
This is where we are going to provide the links which are accessible only for a long time

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.370
user.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.580
So I'm gonna come here,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.870
press,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.980
enter a hitter of equals,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.450
toe dot slash view all contacts.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.190
Let's also get a caption in a similar style with you all contacts and let's add a pipe.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.270
You're a separator and clear this summit that has a Ural mapping off this text.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.680
So I'm gonna copy this right Click the package New class,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.790
the name of the class.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.680
I'm gonna give it us view all contacts,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.750
Sell it on super class as usual.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.650
Http.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.540
Starlet click Finish.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.200
Give the Ural pattern using the in addition Web starlet as do all contacts import Web

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.750
summit,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230
our default cereal washing.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.940
You already get it off these comments I do get by pressing control space,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.120
start typing T or G E and then press enter.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.900
Get it off these two lines.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.210
A typical controller.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.610
Somebody's supposed to read the input from the request.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.230
But I don't have any imports coming from the user here,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.860
so obviously the first step is not required.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.550
But then we need to make use of saris object,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.870
and then get the list off contact,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.400
which you can just do by typing contact.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.800
Service service equals toe new contacts with and then we say your list equals toe Survey

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.490
start get all contacts list needs to be created as a variable.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.370
I have to press command one on Windows Press control One press enter and then we got the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.460
list off contacts.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.520
We need to store this in the request.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.860
Copes,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.050
I'm gonna say request Dark Said attribute.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.500
Let's call it US contacts and then say list.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.570
So contacts is the attribute that JSP is will use listed the object that we have over here

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.570
,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.160
Of course,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
to avoid the unnecessary creation of variables,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.970
you can simply cut this from here on,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.480
then paste over here.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.700
After that,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.870
we just had a forward the request to a JSP.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.310
Currently,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.780
I don't have this Jsp.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.760
Let's assume that we're gonna have a J speak all show context,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.710
or GSP.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.420
So I'm gonna say request or get request dispatcher slash zabin f slash views slash show

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.360
contacts dark GSP and then we have to say dot forward bypassing the request and response

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.610
objectives perimeters.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.970
One other thing that we also have to do is to ensure that only logged in users can access

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.030
this Ural on that is done by simply copying.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.420
Is Ural Pattern going to the log in check filter and then put a comma here and based on the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.710
oral pattern on our controller is now ready.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.010
The only missing thing is the JSP called Show Context or Jay Z.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.610
In the next lecture,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.020
let's create the same.
