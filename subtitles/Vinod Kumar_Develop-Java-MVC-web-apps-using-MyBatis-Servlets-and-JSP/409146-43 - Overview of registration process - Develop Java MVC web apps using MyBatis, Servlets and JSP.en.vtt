00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
in this lecture.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.550
Let's have an understanding off the entire process in order in the registration modern.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.010
It begins when the client makes a get request.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.750
We need to provide a hyperlink in the home page so that the user can do a self registration

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.750
.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.930
When the user clicks on the hyperlink,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.820
it's always going to be a get request,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.350
and they get the question is going to be received by a controller.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:30.020
Let's call it us a register several it on this register solid because the point is making a

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.940
get request.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.450
Is simply going toe respond with registration form JSP.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.900
The user is then going toe,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.270
fill in the details and then click the submit button.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.130
And that's going to be a post request to the same several.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.920
It so in the controllers is the request.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.150
It gets all the request perimeters,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.320
and the only thing it does is it's gonna pass the control toe the service layer on in the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.680
service.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.950
Later,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.760
we have a function called as a registered user,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.680
and this function is going to collect all the values.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.020
And then probably there's some validation,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.940
for example,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.090
verifying whether the mandate we feel such as Neiman email are entered or not,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.000
whether the password is matching with the confirm password,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.890
and then it also has to verify whether the user's email it only registered with us.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.760
If that is the case,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.770
that's also validation.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.070
Error for that surgeries later is going to be Nokia function on the deal earlier so that it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.970
can trick to our user based on the email.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.070
So the user has already submitted the email and Decimal is now going to be president of the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.390
deal.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.340
Will air delivery simply going to get the user details for the given email now that only

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.260
two outcomes either the email it already form.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.500
So we get one record because it is unique are the email is not registered with us.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.900
Hence,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.030
there is not a card back in the service.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.260
Later,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.670
we're going to check whether we got a user for the given email.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.690
If the answer is yes,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.510
that means it is an invalid email on our validation as fade.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.800
Now that the valuation has failed,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.630
we're gonna just return back to the controller with the details of the EDL.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.610
Probably using a hash MMA on the controller is simply going toe give the registration form

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.950
back with 11 adult messages.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.410
But if there was no violation errors,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.450
that means the name has been entered.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.560
Email has been entered.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.270
Passwords match on.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.850
There is no record for this.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.530
Given emails,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.440
everything is okay now that services again going to contact the D A.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.240
Will air and invoke a function toe.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.860
Register these details as a new user,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.610
and then the deal air is going toe insert record in the Devi comes back with the i D on,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.150
then gives the control back to the service.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.900
That said,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.590
we simply return the control toe.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.160
The actual separate and the sunlight will now redirect the user to the dashboard.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.530
So this is the entire process.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.550
Off registration.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.770
There are two ways to start developing the top down approach in the bottom of approach.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.390
The top down approach starts from developing the resources from left to right.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.400
So you start by creating the HTML Ajay speed required for your use case and then write the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.250
controllers dented the services,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.850
then read the deal functions.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.400
The ultimate is that you plan very well and then start rating the deal functions then

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.550
called the service functions,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.370
which make use of the deal on,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.700
then right the court in the controller class and then provide the Js piece for this model.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.310
We're gonna follow the bottom up approach so we'll start from the d A.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.290
Will identify the functions required over there and read the same thing and then write the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.250
service function.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.450
Makers of the deal functions and then the controller sublet,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.080
which makes it of salaries.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280
And then eventually the JSP page is so that's all for now.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.550
See you in the next lecture.
