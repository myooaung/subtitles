00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
in this lecture,

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.970
let's address the last missing part,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.670
which is the registered our jsp under slash webinars Views folder,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.690
which is right here.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.340
So I'm gonna wreck,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.640
click and say new JSP file and then say You're register,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.490
press enter and that creates a fight on Let me get it off this first and then include the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.820
common header and photos I'm gonna say percentage at include finally call store dot slash

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.250
header dot che SPF on,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.420
then percentage Greater than copy paste the same thing for food or also on in between.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.080
I want to give here something like,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.470
let's say it's three new user registration form,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.040
maybe a hitch on.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.520
And now I want to give an HTML form here which actually submits the content toe.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.510
The same mural that it came from,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.840
for which I can simply say form action equals to either an empty string are you don't even

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.710
have to give this action at all.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.620
But apparently method equals toe post has to be given because that is when the farm get

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.850
submitted to the new post.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.300
On inside this,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.430
I want to create an HTML form.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.660
But since you're using bootstrap,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.750
which makes our website looks pretty.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.950
We need to use the bush abscesses classes for working with forms.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.990
So let's go toe get bootstrap dot com and that has a documentation.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.850
Look for any off the elements that you're working with,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.430
for example,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.750
currently working it form.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080
So I'm gonna type your form on.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.430
You can see it shows the forms selig dirt on here.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.880
You get the help required for any kind of forms and there are different kinds of forms over

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.320
here.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.420
All you to do is tow.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.250
Look it the one you want and click the copy button,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.980
place it in your HTML or jsp and then make the necessary changes.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.680
So the one that I want to use is something that had the label on the left side on the text

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.720
boxes on the right side,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.280
which is something like this.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.030
I know that reduces a do for each off the row.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.220
So there is an email and then email are possible and password.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.760
You can see that the do has a class off form group and rope there.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.450
The label.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.540
Then there is another deal.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.380
Now,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.120
since I already know this by practice,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310
so I'm gonna go back toe the Jsp and use the same thing I need here.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.790
Name,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.200
email,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.610
password and confirm password.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.610
So I need four rows and,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.930
of course,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.640
one more for the submit button itself.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.260
So I'm gonna type your deal.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.590
Class equals toe form group and then Arrgh,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.570
Arrgh,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.480
ideally in bootstrap consists off 12 grids on a column can be specified with appropriate

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.410
number of grids.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.250
For example,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.900
For a label,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.980
I can say I need four grades for the text boxes I need around,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.400
let's say,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.290
eight groups.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.280
So to do that,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.300
I'll type your label and then say far recalls to name Classical is toe call MD.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.830
Let's say four MD stand for medium Bush up assumes that you have extra small devices like

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.710
mobile phones.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.680
Small devices like a little bigger phones are a smaller tablet.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.480
The medium devices include the bigger tablets and laptop screens,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.970
and then LG for large correspond to a high resolution screen.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.080
And then I'll say your name.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.350
And then the 2nd 1 is gonna be a do with a class off call MBI and then remaining eight or

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.950
less.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.760
If you give more than it cannot fit in one row,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.000
it will go to the next through.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.280
So that's some off Greggs used by different columns in a row should be 12 or less.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.050
So I can say you're eight.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.140
And inside that I'm gonna have your and input type because toe text class equals toe form

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.710
control.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.890
This is the one that makes the textbooks.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.750
Looks very nice.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.350
You can also add a placeholder,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.660
but I'm already giving a label.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.130
So place for that is not required.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.190
Importantly,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.970
I leave your name equals student.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.400
Dean,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.460
this is the key value pair that goes to the sunlit when we submit the form Onda.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.840
Since we're using label far records named this corresponds to the idea off the text box.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.200
Now,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.200
I didn't not used by sorrow state program ings like salads and jsp.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.660
But they're typically used by JavaScript.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.440
So we will use that when were doing valuation in the future.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.950
Right now this is OK for me.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.670
So we got a label on a text box now.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.200
I can copy and paste this a few times.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.630
I need one for email.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.270
One for password,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.650
one for confirm password.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.160
So I'm gonna change the same thing on tape.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.460
Your email address on this is gonna be the i d email,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.560
which is this one.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.270
And this is supposed to be an email because we want to read email in our request.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.020
Object on this is the email box that I want to give.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.340
So on a browser,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.700
it doesn't make much of a difference.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.810
But on a mobile,

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.780
the ways when you tap on the text,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.070
wants you and see an email keypad coming up Similarly,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.780
this is going to be a password on bond.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.250
This is going to be all password here.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.880
So the idea I'm gonna give password a type of also possible,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.930
because that way the textures mosque to it starts on.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.830
Name is password.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.550
Because that's what I'm actually looking for in the request object.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.550
And I did because I gave the label for So that's also going to be password.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.040
And the last one is gonna be Let's a re enter possible for our confirm password.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.880
Let's call this a C underscored password everywhere and the same thing I'm gonna give for

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.770
name as well as I d.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.700
Of course,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.250
their textbooks here is gonna be the password box.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.000
Now,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.820
apart from all these,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.560
I also want a submit button.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.380
You can just take the button right here.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.270
But there will be a line on the left side if you want the burden to be aligned towards this

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.270
,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.780
we to the textbooks.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.550
So let's one more here.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.150
So I'm gonna copy this and based once again.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.110
But this is a dummy label,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.690
so I don't need any off these.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.390
Andi,

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.070
I don't need a text because the dummy label this is required.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:11.150
But here I'm gonna take a bottom class equals to bt in bt and primary.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.660
And then I tape your register.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.160
We can also give a recent button as input type equals toe reset.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.760
When the user clicks undid all the text that the user has tied will be arrest on the form

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.600
will be reset back to its original appearance.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.460
But the class name I want to give it like Bt and Bt and hyphen link.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.950
So it looks like a hyperlink.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.210
Value is nothing,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.050
but we set another registration form is complete.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.810
So if you go to your sublet over here when you make a get request toe this it's going to

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.270
simply produce the registered a jcb.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.650
But after submitting that registered our JC.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.730
That control comes over here because we said here mattered equals two posed and their do

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.760
post is reading all the values over here,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.550
sending it to the appropriate service function.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.790
I know that when there is an arrow beer storing errors as an object in our request

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.060
attribute which now you're registered or JSP has an access to and Paris is a map.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.120
Map is nothing with Akiva Loop Here,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.170
you can use the same errors,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.550
object in your jsp here and then display if there is any others.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.210
For example,

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.410
if there was an error over here again,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.380
simply type your deal and then I can say class equals toe that they text dash danger and

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.520
this will give you basically a medic alert text and I can simply type your dollar editors

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.100
dark.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.410
The key in the map name is one of the key,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.450
so that is there in our user service.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.210
If you go to the user service over here,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.980
you can t v a.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.980
Storing all the field names as keys.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.410
So we are basically accessing these in this format.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.550
If there is no value for this field than this whole dear is gonna be empty so nothing is

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.370
going to be displayed.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.830
But if there is an error message died,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.450
a message will be displayed like this.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.040
So I'm gonna copy this section on,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:12.070
then based over here and then change this toe email similarly for password on D C.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.730
Bus work note is here.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.880
We're using c underscore.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.240
Possible.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.380
But this is the one we have stored in our map objects so you can see your see password.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.250
That's what I've used.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.980
So now our model view and controller is ready.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.980
But to check all these things will also provide a hyperlink in our header Georgie SPF so

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.440
that we can click the hyperlink and check the registration process.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.650
So let's go to the head of Dodgy s fear.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.840
After this,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.630
Do let's have another do whose classes container and then add here a couple of links.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.950
The first link is for the home page.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.490
It since I'm gonna say a hitter,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:59.330
fickle store dot slash and then type here home that also had a pipe so that it looks like a

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.140
separator.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:06.710
The 2nd 1 is going to be a a hitched a WTO dark slash register.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.480
This is the one that we want toe check right now.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.550
So I'm gonna type your register.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:17.460
That answer are one more hyperlink for log in which we don't have at this time so that they

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.370
hit terrific ALS too dark slash logging on.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.510
Let's call it as log in.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.010
We'll also give couple off breaks here so that there is a gap between the sender next

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.770
section.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.950
So now application looks like,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.640
really Let's go and run all project.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.940
So let's right click on the phone book Project Runners Run Answer would on We got our page

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.690
and you can see we got the link toe homepage resistor and log in.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.710
If I click on the register,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.650
it get request to the summit on that.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.420
Supposed to bring me the JSP?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:57.380
You can see we got the html page and I should be able tow type in the name email,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.020
password,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.000
reenter password and then click on this reset button toe.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.800
Clear everything.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.130
But if I click on the register,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.790
it should actually go to the solid back,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.240
but this time with the post matter,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.620
and then come back with error messages.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.780
So if I don't take anything,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.930
let's click on the register.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.580
You should know.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.040
See,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.350
that name is mandatory.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.340
Email is mandatory.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.450
Password is mandatory.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.790
But if I type something in the password on Denman Arctic on register,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.950
you can say it is passports Do not match.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.550
Of course the passwords get interest.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.030
And if I type your one later and then click on register,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.030
you can see that it says at least three letters required.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.850
So all these are happening properly.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.170
Even if I refresh its going toe,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.810
ask for re submission,

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.170
it will still go back to the star it and comes back over here.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.910
I'm gonna take my name.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.330
We know that.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:43.730
Come on,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.610
email.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.720
I just let me type it us.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:52.430
We know that we know dot co on possible Let's take the secret and reenter password.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.780
I'll also take the same thing.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.220
Click on register Now.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.450
This time it's goingto go to the separate over here.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.860
Onda collect all the values,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.910
makes a request,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:09.690
gets a valid user object on do the object will be stored in the session and then it will

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.700
redirect with something called dashboard.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.890
And we don't have dashboard yet because of which we get a four,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.390
not four,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.330
but by that time each love either,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.720
and you record in the database statement.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.190
That's what we are more interested in.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.890
Let's go and check the same thing by click on register expected foreign or for error

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:27.550
message.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.050
So that's click,

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.000
and you can see we got four right for it,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.210
says phonebook.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.050
Slash dashboard is not dead.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.930
But if I go to the hitch to counsel over here on day,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.880
let's refresh.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.250
Once on click on Connect,

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.270
click the users on Run Select.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:52.090
So from Users Command and I don't see the card or here this is family because we never did

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.710
commit.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.870
And this is supposed to be done in our deal factory,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.910
where we are getting a session object.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.590
We have to stay here true,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.150
indicating it has to do an auto commit.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.210
Let's give it a try back,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.770
so we go back to our page over here.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.100
Phonebook application.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.950
Let's go to the phone book homepage register again.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:22.740
Let's say we not we know that we know dot co password A secret on the entering the same

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.120
thing.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.690
Clicking on register again.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.790
Negative for not four.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.670
That is okay.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.360
I go back to the it's to console click on Run On,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.810
you'll see that we have the newly genital i.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.930
D two under the name email persuaded secret and created at its own.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:44.160
So they don't think one thing we don't want is to store the password like this because

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.740
everybody can know the password off everybody else.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.780
So the best way to do is tow.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.020
Encrypt the password.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.090
Andi store the same thing in the next lecture.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.470
Let's encrypt this password on store in the database.
