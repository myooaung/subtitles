X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
in deflector.

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's create a controller on the view combination,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.900
which produces the page for dashboard requests to do so.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.990
Let's go toe over that package.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.130
Are they new controller?

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.180
Which is nothing but the subjects I'm gonna wreck.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.530
Click on the package.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.410
New class.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.940
Let's call this ass dashboard.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.950
Starting it on super class is supposed to be http Summit.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.080
It's like that Click.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.810
OK,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.350
click finish to come out of that.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.180
That's at a an addition here.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.450
Web summit,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.160
toe map,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.370
this toe slash dashboard.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.480
Your request.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.410
We'll also have defaulted in which you ready?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.440
Get it off.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
The comment on this is going to be only a get request.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880
So there is no post request for the summit.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.620
Simon type here.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.870
Do get Let's get off these two lines on.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.150
The first thing we have to do here is to check if the user has logged in or not.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.950
If the user has not logged in,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.460
then we simply have to redirect the user back toe.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.950
Either log in or register are probably the homepage.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.840
But if the user has logged in,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.700
may simply have toe present the dashboard dot jsp,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.180
which we don't have yet so to check that.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.260
I'm going to say user equals to request our get session.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.980
Don't get attribute called User on.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.630
This has to be created off type user User is from our indeedy package on this request

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.100
Casting.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.530
Let's press command one and press enter toe at the casting and now we can check if user

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
equals toe Know that means the user hasn't loved in yet.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.160
So we'll simply say rescue dot send redirect to you can say dot slash,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.050
which is nothing with the homepage.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.840
All you can say,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.250
doc slash register dot slash logging.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.070
Ideally,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.730
it should be the log in page because you're trying to access something that you are not

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.110
logged in.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.090
But since we don't have the log in page yet,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.600
so we'll simply redirect the user to the homepage and then save Britain.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.410
But if everything is OK,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.150
we say here request don't get request dispatcher toe slash robin f.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:16.350
It's life views slash dashboard Don't chase B and then we have to do a forward request

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.330
response.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.740
The very billions are Arctic,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.590
you aria speed.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.490
That's all in the dashboard.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.450
There is nothing else.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.750
How would we don't have the jsp x I'm gonna copy this name,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.550
right?

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.710
Click on the views and then say new jsp file on,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.770
then paste the name,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.680
press enter,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.090
get it of everything and then include the content off header and footer Jsp s So I'm gonna

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.900
say less than percentage at include follicles,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.940
toe dark slash header dark chase B f Close it on,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.270
then copy paste I hear footer in between I can say probably hitched three on I want to give

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.940
him a says you're Hello Welcome back And we also want to tell who is that user whose love

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.430
being so remember we have our session off picture We can always say dollar session scope

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.320
dot user So in the session scope we have an object user on the user has a property called

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.870
name which we can use So it is Hello.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.710
We know we'll come back on the other You see here is not really another so you can select

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.340
everything cut it and paste it and you can see that there has gone So let's run the project

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.370
by right click on the project name runners run on server So we have here the homepage I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.840
don't have any users right now because I deleted the users over here so you can see,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.700
selects or from use.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.150
This is not giving any data.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.160
If I time directly dashboard like this Onder,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.260
then press enter.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.770
You can see that it's redirecting back toe the home page again.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.290
Let's click on Register a new user.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.940
Let's type your my full name.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.660
Did not Come on.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.380
We know that we know dot co secret is the possible and again the same thing.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.450
Take on register.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.240
And this time,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.400
when I register successfully,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.350
it'll say hello,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.020
we not come on.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.880
Welcome back.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.870
Once you have loved been successfully,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.330
we don't want the register and log in buttons.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.700
Instead,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.140
we want the lager button,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.310
but before that we will provide an option for the user toe log in.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.340
So that's all for this lecture.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.540
Seeing the next one
