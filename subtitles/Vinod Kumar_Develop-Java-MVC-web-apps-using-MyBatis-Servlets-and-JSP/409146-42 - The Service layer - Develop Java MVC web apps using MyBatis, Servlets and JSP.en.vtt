00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
in this sector.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's create two more classes,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.690
which belonged toe a layer called the service layer.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.550
The service later takes care off calling are making use of the deal functions so that my

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.240
controller,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.770
which is going to be a separate their life,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.750
becomes easier.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.110
So let's right.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.360
Click on one of the existing back of this new class.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.430
Change the name of the package tow service on the name of the class.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.390
Let's give it US user service.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.070
Our user manager click on finish.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.670
So this is going to contain all functional is related to a user such as register or log in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.670
,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.860
which in turn,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.970
makers off the user Delwar toe add a new record to the user,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.460
are get the records based on the email or get all users and so on and so forth.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.820
Let's create one more class here,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.450
so I'm gonna right click on the service package.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.580
New Plus,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.050
this is gonna be called us contact service again.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.410
I'm saying this is acting as a facade or a superficial layer for the be able the functional

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.200
it is for these classes we will add as and when we proceed further,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.510
you know,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.690
Project as and when we addressed new use cases will come and at the appropriate function it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.570
is over here.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.630
For example,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.600
if I'm creating a user registration peach based email content in a jsp file,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.200
the sublet corresponding to this which access controller the business logic function,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.890
probably like a registered user,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.700
are probably the mapping of a skill command to the deal function.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.550
All of them.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.460
The end to end functionally did,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.290
will provide for use case.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.350
So that's all for this lecture.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.350
See you in the next one.
