X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
in the sector.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.850
Let's encourage the password using something called decrypt.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.910
So the very first thing that we want to do is tow Add that live in two different,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.880
insist all projects.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.490
So I go to the main one Central look for something called J decrypt,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.180
which provides an implementation off the big crypt for Java.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.990
So I'm gonna set the 1st 1 Get the latest Washington in that copy the dependency.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.320
Come back door eclipse,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.390
go to the bomb,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.070
direct salmon,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.200
come back somewhere at the bottom and then pays the dependency form I don't see on If you

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.820
go and have a look at the moment.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.170
Dependence is you will now see that there is something called J b crypto chart.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.000
So this forward said class Corby crypt and that has got some utility functions where we can

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.810
encrypt as well as verify whether the password is correct or not.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.210
So to do that,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.510
let's go to the user survey start shallow because that is where we are trying toe add the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.050
record to the database using this particular function over here on just before creating the

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.780
user.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.910
We want to take this possible on,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.510
then encrypt that So this is a location where we want to actually do.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.950
The encryption on this is done by using something called Be Crypt,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.380
Let's say controlled space toe import the same dot You have a function called as hash

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.010
password.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.740
That is a function that we have here,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.570
and there takes the password,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.680
which is nothing but our password that we have received from the user.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.070
The 2nd 1 is what's called salt,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.810
and this is the text that is going to be used for encrypting your password are hashing the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.390
password,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.340
and you can gendered assault by using something called Be crypt dot gen salt and that

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.990
actually will do the job.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.640
But if you want to specify how many rounds off attrition it should do,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.710
you can also supply now toilets.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.020
Consider the good number.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.920
Let's give that as it is on the return value off.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.950
This is going to be our hash.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.620
The password.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.910
You can either assigned that back to password are you can actually assent to a variable and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.660
then positive gate.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.020
So this is the way you can encrypt your password.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.590
When we implement the logging model,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.270
we will see how to verify whether The password given by the user is correct according to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.070
the encrypted passwords.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:28.090
So I'm gonna say this now restart the server and let's go back to our phone book obligation

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.090
.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.170
Let's go to the home page One city fresh on,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.690
There's a register link you're taking on the register should take me to this.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.620
We have seen this.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.050
Let's go on type a different use of this time.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.660
So I'm gonna type your sham on,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.010
say,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.150
Sham at example dot com possible.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.550
Once again,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.950
I'm gonna give secret password again.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.520
A secret click on Register on again.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.620
Expect the four not for here and that's OK,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.150
so we're going to the dashboard,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.100
which means it must have inserted the record.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.280
I go to the console off each to Little Miss Onda under select Start from you that speaking

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.340
on this time you can see that the password is now hashed.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.250
The one thing with respect to the B crypto encoder is that every time you're encrypting

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.160
your password,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.380
the same password,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.180
major data,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.190
different hash,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.620
and that's why it's called the one way possible in quarter.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.550
Other word can check whether to hash passwords are originated from the same string or not.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.130
And that is what we would be using when we are working with Larkin.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.660
Now,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.850
things I don't want these two records anymore.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.900
I want to read on my script.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.000
So the script is the DB script or rescue that I have here on.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.570
I have a commander that copied and pasted over here.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.850
I'm gonna copy this and then based over here,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.270
execute this.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.870
Now the tables are dropped and recreated.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.720
So if you go and check the you the stable year now there is no users in the next lecture

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.850
lets it does the missing dashboard.
