00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
in this sector.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.920
Let's implement this log in function off the user service.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.910
So this is a business logic function which is supposed to validate whether email and

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.910
passwords have been entered are not.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.720
Also,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.500
it has toe in work one of the deal function toe.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.580
Get the user details based on this email and then verify with this past world which is not

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.960
being hashed as off.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.390
No,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.050
with the one that we have stored in the database,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.950
which is currently in the hashed format here.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.350
And in case if there are any validation errors such as email is not entered,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.360
password is not entered are there is no user corresponding to the email given are the user

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.960
exist?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.210
But the password of the mismatch We have to send those errors square this address object.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.100
But if everything is OK,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.650
then we have toe return the user object.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.720
So first,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.100
let's add the validation than I'm gonna copy this section because this we have already done

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.100
.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.980
This takes care of the required validation rule for email and passwords.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.070
I'm gonna copy and paste over here,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.270
but we now have to check if there is a user for the given email,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.760
which we have done over here.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm gonna copy these two lines and then based over here deal factored out.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760
Get use early about truth in Iowa.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.380
Exceptions.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.960
So let's throw it away from our function and then come back over here.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.200
If user is no.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.170
That means there is no user for the given email,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.110
so I can put that at another message.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.790
Soil pipe here,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.080
if user equals toe none that a Arabs dark put on and email is the field for which I want to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.300
give another message and say,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.150
for example,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.650
invalid email our password.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.610
We don't want to really tell the user that whether the user has given a wrong email or

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.360
wrong password,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.420
so we don't want toe narrow down the situation to the user.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.240
But if user is not a question on,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.610
that means they're either user.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.640
However,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.040
it is possible that the password entered by the user is different than the password in the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.950
user object.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.740
And this is where we now have to use the B crypt utility class toe.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.750
Verify whether the password given here the same as the password in the user object to do

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.250
that.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.280
Let's come over here and then type bullion result equals toe be crypt dot You can see that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.270
there is a function called check password.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.990
So I'm going to stay like the chick password function.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.450
The plain text is the password entered by the user.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.350
The hash to password is nothing but user dot get password.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.220
In case if they match,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.350
the result will be to otherwise the result will be false.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:48.310
So we can say if result equals two false will be the same error message once again once you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.260
come out off this if condition now,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.150
we'll check if errors dot size greater than zero.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.070
We have toe written none.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.990
So I can copy that from here and then paste over here.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.680
But if everything is okay,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.230
we want toe written the user from here with this now our log in function off the user

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.810
services.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.210
Really?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.130
In fact,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.460
the actual logging model itself is really Let's run the project and check it out.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.630
So I'm going to right click on the phone book project Modernize.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.920
Don't answer what?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.340
Let me click on the log in link over here.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.460
We told typing anything I take on log in and you can see it comes back and says,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.060
Invalid email Password.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.610
I really should have been.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.920
Email is mandatory to fix that.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.270
Let's go back over here.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.660
So since one off this is missing,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.350
we don't have to go forward here.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.550
So I'm gonna copy this and then paste even here also so that the control goes back to the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.980
user without having toe check in the database.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.540
So let's save this restart,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.180
dunk it,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.060
go back to the browser and click on logging again.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.740
On this time,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.150
you can see email addresses.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.930
Mandatory password is mandatory.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.410
Let's type in the email as we know we know dot Go on.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.620
Then let's say I'm gonna type a SDF as the password,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.520
which is incorrect.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.000
Password.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.370
When I click on Logan,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.810
you can see it comes back with an adamancy saying that invalid email password.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.170
Nor does the email is getting it ist That's family because we're forwarding the control

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.950
back to the JSP on the JSP has a textbooks without any values.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.560
Now,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.960
if you want the previous values to be preserved here,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.970
it's very simple.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.600
These are part of the request perimeter so I can come back to the JSP here,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.880
which is right here.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.920
And I can say value equals two and then use an expression that says bottom dot email.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.090
Param corresponds to the perimeter or request perimeter,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.750
which is nothing but this itself.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.830
We don't want to preserve the password.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.260
Let's leave that as it is,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.250
saved this.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.910
Go back to the browser.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.900
Let's do one thing.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.900
Let's click on the log in button once again and now I'm gonna type here.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.680
We know I'd be no Darko.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.760
He is deify the password.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.250
Click on logging and you can see it comes back and says Invalid email are possible.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.050
I know that it the password mystic because the email is valued.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.390
Let's type secret,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.400
which is the correct posture and click on Log in,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.520
and it should go back to the dashboard,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.500
insists hello.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.050
We know from our welcome back.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.080
If I goto home here and then type the log in once again or click on the log in button,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.260
it should not ask for the logging because user has already logged in and we have taken care

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.800
off that.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.050
So if you go back to the log in some right here,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.780
you can see that we have checked.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.070
If the user is not equals to none,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.390
which is coming from the fission.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.670
We're redirecting the user production war since I've already logged in.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.650
If I click on the log in button and again,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.150
you can see that it simply goes to the dashboard in Slough going to the long inform.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.470
Of course,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.930
the next thing we have to provide is a lager button on the longer burden also should be

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.670
conditional.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.720
So if the user has already logged in the register and log and should not be here,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.120
but instead we should have a lot of good button.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.700
In the next lecture,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.850
let's implement the same.
