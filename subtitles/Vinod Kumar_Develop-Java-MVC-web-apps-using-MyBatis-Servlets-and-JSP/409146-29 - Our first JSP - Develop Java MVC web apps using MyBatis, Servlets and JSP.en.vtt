X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
in this letter.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.030
Let's have a look at how J space work for this.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm going toe right click on my back folder or that solid demo project so I can right click

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.660
here and then say New JSP file.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.500
No did It's gonna go and select the about automatically.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.200
Let's give the name as hello dot jsp.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.640
If you click next year,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.220
it's going toe.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.900
Ask you to choose a template,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.740
and it's It's a GSP with HTML.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.460
If I market,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.650
that's the one that I want.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.100
I click finish as you can observe.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.280
It's nothing but an HTML file,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.270
but with little different syntax over here on this pilot optional right now so I can even

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.750
get it up.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.050
This and it will still work.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.250
There's no need to make any changes here that's just going tape your hello Jsp,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.010
and I'm gonna give the same thing as hitch.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.460
One based it.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.950
Let's put a horizontal rule on then probably a paragraph developed by we don't slash b that

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.630
saved this.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.180
Andi,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.750
run this by right click on this organized announcer work.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.590
So when I do this,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.630
you can see it's going to come up on the browser as expected.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.230
There the hitch.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.090
One Hitcher and Balanoff.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.870
If I rightly care and then say view pictures,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.670
you may observe that the special syntax,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.750
what we had in our JSP is no longer available over there.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.960
So this part is gone.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.700
So which means it's not the same file like its team.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.210
Afraid so.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.360
The extreme If I will be sent to the client as is,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.790
and there is no processing done on the subway,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.840
however,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.080
for Jsp dissident different so you can see that jsp the modified washing off my source

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.070
score so behind the scene.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.890
What's happening is that this file is getting converted into a Java source school and then

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.190
the jobless so scored get converted into a Java class file and then instance off the job

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.930
plus gets loaded into the VM,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.720
which is nothing but a sunlit.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.210
Now,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.860
if you want to have a look into the source scored generated,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.150
let's go toe New finder window are Windows Explorer in case of windows.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.970
So I go over toe my desktop where my project location is their training workspace,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.550
and this is the location where we have a dark meta data,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.560
which is invisible because it's a hidden folder to access the same someone open a new

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.790
terminal over here,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.190
Onda.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.500
Then I'm going to say your CD space.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.430
I'm gonna drag and drop that over here.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.770
So we get the city into this,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.310
and if you see here,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.710
unless minus L A will show me that there's something called Meta data.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.340
Also,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.060
I'm gonna go into a city meta data that has a plug INS folder and that contains all the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.620
plug ins that your eclipse is currently configured with.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.350
So I'm gonna know.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.650
Say,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.300
open.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.250
Don't that brings up another finder window here.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.960
You can see training workspace as a here unfolded meta data.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.310
No,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.980
on the dot plug ins and the plug in that is responsible for your server.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.950
Is this our eclipse Wst Sarwer core on inside that we have this PM p zero.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.650
We saw this earlier when we introduce subjects in the beginning Andi,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.110
the temporary folders where your applications are deployed.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.400
So the wtp Robertses radio application is currently deployed.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.660
So this is where do you see your actual JSP failure?

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.980
Hello?

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.460
Jsp on All the Java classes corresponding to your sunlit will be there inside the classes

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.330
as exploded package.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.360
So this is the actual war file,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.000
but that's an exploded format.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.140
However,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.910
the JSP files what you have get converted into a Java and then in tow,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.300
Dark class file in a temporary work folder,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.480
which is over here.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.250
So I'm gonna click on this work folder and you can see there's a Catalina.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.200
So let me reduce the were tough this click on Catalina local host.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.340
You can see there's one folder for your current project also,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.980
but this doesn't contain all your rabbi Neff.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.790
WebEx ameliorate steam and none off those exist over here because this is a temporary work

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.850
area for J Space to be converted into Charles.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.580
So notice that there is a package like for the structure here.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:27.920
You can say our dot Apache dot jsp dot and then you see Hello underscored jsp dark Chaba

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.970
Also the class fell over here.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.270
Let me open the same in visual studio court.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.780
You can see that it's nothing but a regular job class on the class name here is called

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.330
Hello underscored jsp that inherit from something called hitch TTP JST base.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:55.000
So if I goto eclipse back over here and goto navigate open type hierarchy Onda Type the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.250
name X TTP jsp based.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.890
You'll see that this particular class is a subclass off its TTP sunlit,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.350
which is also supplies off gender accelerate.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.810
So,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.520
in other words,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.570
the class that is created here Hello Jsp indirectly inherit from its GDP solid and becomes

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.560
a solid by itself.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.640
So,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.130
in other words,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.770
an object off.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.580
This is nothing but a solid object.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.180
You can also see that there are few variables over here and there is a static blood

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.340
guarding some imports over here.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.270
So if I scroll down further,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.630
you'll see couple off lifecycle functions over here.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.370
But there are different variants.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.860
Underscore J spin it and underscore J speed.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.740
A strike on this is the one which is the service function off.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.600
Your result in some late.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.550
So the underscore tsp sideways.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.340
You could see the argument request is off tape.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.860
It's TTP solid requests.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.560
It's really personally responds those of the two argument types.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.780
It has exactly the same signature as your do get our do post.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.430
So if I scroll down over here inside this,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.250
you can see some variables have been declared over here.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.240
So the request response page Context session application,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.360
conflict out on page.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.080
All these are called implicit objects,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.570
so that's because remember currently this particular pages created by Apache Tomcat.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.220
But if you are using some other server like Web logic,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.930
for example,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.760
the names of the classes,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.980
the names of the packages,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.440
the names of all these variables may differ.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.300
However,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.100
the variable names like request a response on on these variables.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.430
David remained the same thing because their standardized by Java community process and

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.470
hence there called implicit objects.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.170
Which means we respect your wits that what you're going to use these variables you can

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.340
always use in your JSP s.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.520
Let's go somewhere down over here on now.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.840
This is the location where the enter HTML part that we have written over here this part is

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.880
now converted into a series off outdoor trade,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.640
including the blank lines.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.900
As you can see over here,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.480
this is the one that viewed of return in our subjects.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.870
But instead of writing in our subject,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.590
which is a job,

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.060
plus,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.520
we're writing in a HTML like court,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.660
which is much simpler.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.880
So if I want to add,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.570
for example,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.160
s styling or if I want to create a table.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.830
It is very easy to create over here instead of creating Inner Jolla program.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.450
And that's exactly what this JSP engine is doing.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.910
It takes our it's Team a light Court but eventually converted it into a gel.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.250
A class like this.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.940
So if I make some change over here,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.660
for example,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.060
let's say I'm going to say we know Kumar Kyle tire and save this.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.960
If I go back to the browser and reload that over here I see that change.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.900
But the actual changes reflected,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.190
or even here also you can see it's changed instantly.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.520
So as soon as we refers the browser,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.950
the browser made a request.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:56.480
Now the just the engine realizes that the object that is currently in the JBM is a stale

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.080
object.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.150
So it's going to transform your Jsp toe a new Java,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.270
and then it complains that into a new dark class while it discards the old object in the

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.680
memory.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.440
And then it will reload a new object that is made out of this particular class just to show

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.680
you how to use one off this implicit objects.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.770
Let's go back over here and either html form.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:23.540
That's a form Action equals to an empty string this time because if you are not giving

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.710
anything when you submit,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.400
it will be submitted back toe the same jsp file.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.530
So we will see that once again,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:36.460
I'm gonna type You're under your name and then a text box here in port type pickles,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.650
toe text name equals toe.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:45.430
Let your underscored me and let's close the bracket and then for the button for submit.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.650
Let's give the caption as submit itself.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.680
Now,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.210
if you're typing something and press enter the same,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.670
JSP receives the request,

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.780
and here I can process the form that's being submitted to do that.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.110
Let's open a special bracket over here on this is called script lit,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.550
and we will discuss that in the subsequent lectures.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:12.280
But this is where you can write a regular job decor so you're JSP engine will transform

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.680
everything here into a serious off Roader.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.320
Quintal in on this also will be converted into a serious off Roader printer.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.550
Order tried statements,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.300
but this will be untouched because this is considered a Jolla,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.050
so your actual court would be kept here as east.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.350
So let's go and type something over here.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:37.150
We're going to say string need equals toe request dot Get perimeter,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.280
and then the perimeter is nothing,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.100
but you are underscored Name.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.060
That's the name of the text bombs.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.950
Notice request is one of the implicit objects of the object is declared right here.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.590
So because our court is going to be embedded right here,

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:58.820
we have access to this out as well as this request as well as the I don't implicit objects

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.740
I explained.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.080
So I'm gonna come back over here so requested.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.640
Get perimeter off your name.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.580
I'm gonna say,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.290
if name Noriko's toe know because for the first time,

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.770
many with it.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.430
This page,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.200
this name is now,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.560
so I don't have to do anything.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.000
But if name is not equal to know,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.270
I can simply type.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.220
You're out dot print Ellen,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.560
probably I can say you're hit three.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.500
Hello?

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.610
On the name off the person that we are giving.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.710
So with an exclamation probably slash hit three notice.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.430
We are doing exactly the thing that we did earlier with a summer.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.580
But this also can be simplified further.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.710
We will do that in the subsequent videos.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.280
So I'm gonna say this.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.440
Go back to the browser.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.160
If I refresh over here,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.500
you can see it is enter your name.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.920
I'm gonna type your say.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.810
For example,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.700
we don't click on Submit.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.200
You can see it is hello,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.610
we note,

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.670
Let's go and have a look at the result in Java code that's ended it for this.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.920
As I mentioned earlier,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.280
all these statements would be converted into a serious off out dot right statements.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.550
But this will be untouched and will be kept us is.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.370
You can go and have a look at that all here.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.630
So this is the court that exists before that script lit on notice.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.820
The court in this cripple it is untouched,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.870
and it's kept as it is.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.100
So it looks like it's a continuation of this court over here.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.720
So there was some serious off all dot,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.060
right?

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.570
And then there is another outdoor parental in statement.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.770
It doesn't make much difference toe discord at all.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.300
In the next lecture,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.280
let's discuss about the Jsp element,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.280
one of which we already saw,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.850
which is called script Lit
