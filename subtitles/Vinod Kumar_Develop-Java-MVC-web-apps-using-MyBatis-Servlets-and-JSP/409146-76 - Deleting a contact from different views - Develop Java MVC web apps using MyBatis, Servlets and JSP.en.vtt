00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
in this lecture,

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.210
let's create the JSP that is supposed to display the details off this user with a

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.850
confirmation dialog box on clicking this button.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.400
So in the summit,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.140
we have written and name here called Confirm Delete Contact Dodgy.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.970
It's food that doesn't exist in our view,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.130
that's going clear.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.630
The same thing.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.790
I'm gonna copy this name.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.520
All right,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.950
Let the views folder and then say new JSP file based it.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.360
In the next step,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.360
make sure to select the phone book JSP template click finish and here will say conform

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.230
deletion.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.100
And if you wanted to be in red color,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.700
you can always say class equals toe text danger.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.030
And this is where we need toe check whether the contact object existing that request scope

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.660
Look at the delete contact.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.450
Do get here.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.800
We're storing the C one after retrieving indicated the user has Manu elated the idea of the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.750
contact ability on the address bar on If that is either invalid or it doesn't belong to the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.500
current user,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.450
this is going to be no So I need to check if this activity contact Is it none so I can

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.660
check here using the Js steel and in order to use the jail.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.050
Still,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.540
I need the tight labor early.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.860
So I'm gonna go to the beginning and then type here less than a percentage at tag lib you

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.520
are equals toe jsp j still court prefix equal stool on,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.990
then say,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.500
see,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.250
Come back here.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.090
You know you can use a sequel.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.600
And if our sequel and choose when So let's a sequel.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.470
And if testicles toe dollar and then say contact double,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.450
it puts to know if the answer to this condition is yes,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.550
that means the idea is invalid or the contact doesn't belong to the user.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.170
Let's tell the same thing to the user.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.460
I'm gonna say hedge flight.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.950
The idea supplied is either invalid on the contact does not belonged toe your phone book.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.320
But if the contact is not know were to write the condition again.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.780
So I'm going to say your sequel.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.940
And if testicles toe dollar contact not because toe No,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.230
that means the user has access to this contact so that he can delete.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.280
But we need the information from the user.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.780
So we're gonna display a couple of details,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.390
Probably the image on the first name last name are If you want toe display all the details

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.610
like you did in the case off the show contact.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.950
I can copy that section completely from the beginning.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.760
Off this rope.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.710
Tow the end of the drew up to here.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.850
So I'm gonna copy that.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.310
Come back toe this confirmed village,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.450
contact jsp and then paste over here.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.570
Of course,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.090
I don't want toe give these students because they don't make sense over here.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.050
The only thing that I want toe type here would be a text box where the user is supposed to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.230
enter permanently.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.570
Delete someone,

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:16.220
open a paragraph tag and then type this is going toe permanently delete the records from

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.250
our service and cannot be undone.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.850
Close the paragraphs.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.020
Give another paragraph.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.300
If you're sure,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:33.290
Then type permanently delete in the text box given below.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.790
Let's close the paragraph and we need to give a song here that submits the contact.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.580
I d that we're trying to deal it along with the text box.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.240
So we're gonna right the form action is not required because actually is going to go back

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.530
to the same Sublett.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.920
But method is important,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.650
so I'm gonna go get them address post and the contact ready will give it in the form of a

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.190
hidden feel so I can type your input type equals toe hidden so it's not visible to the user

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.750
name is important,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.450
which is called idee on the value for that comes from contact or ideally,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.020
which is the object that we're using toe display on these details.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.720
Then we're gonna give an input type equals toe text box on to form it that nicely.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.790
So we're gonna give here a deal.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.680
Class equals to form dash group on the row,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.770
and the textbooks is gonna occupy probably around four grades so I can take your input.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.750
Type equals toe text.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.190
Classic was toe call dash MD Dash four.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.790
Name is important.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.520
That's the conforms.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.520
And that is what actually we're reading in the delete contacts average that's here.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.780
And now we need to get a button.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.610
So I'm gonna take your button.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.630
Classic was toe Bt in Bt in danger.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:04.420
That's the complete red color button will also give the class called dash MD Dash three And

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.250
then the caption here saying that Deal it.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.600
Let's say this restart,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.250
dunk it,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.950
then go back to the browser.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.650
I may have to log in again.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.450
Let's do that.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.810
I'm gonna log in us.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.660
We know that.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.030
We know dot co and enter goto view all contacts,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.270
delete one person.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.470
They delete this option.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.520
When I click on this,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.740
you can see that it takes me to the similar page because we copied and pasted a lot of

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.410
content.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.640
It is your confirmed elation in red color.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.180
That's the texture danger class we used.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.690
The details are despair,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.070
and it says here this is gonna permanently delete the record from our database and cannot

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.700
be undone.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.850
If you're sure,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.270
Then type permanently delete in the textbooks given below.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.030
I'm gonna type your and then tricked village,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.350
and that's supposed to deliver the actual content.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.020
But if I type your something like,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.620
say,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.270
56 which is not a valid I d.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.360
When I press enter,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.090
you can see it's gonna come back and say the ideas supplied is either invalid or the

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.050
contact doesn't belong to your phone book.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.400
And that's what we expected earlier.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.600
Whatever type your let's say two and press enter now if I come here and then type something

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.080
or if it don't type anything at all and click on delete.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.010
It's gonna come back to the same page and supposed to display an editor.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.340
But we don't have any place holder for the era and the other is supposed to be because off

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.880
this,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.240
But I haven't stored any other Mrs.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.380
So it's a good idea to store and Adam estate here so that we can say the texture did not

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.650
match or something like that.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:52.050
So I'm gonna go give here request dot said attribute and then probably he our message.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:02.360
The other message is going to be like you have to type the text for permanently deal it toe

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.360
,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.150
confirm deletion.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.600
And now we need to display their a message in the JSP.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.140
So that is,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.810
er,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.290
message should be displayed somewhere probably below this are right below the deal here.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:25.630
So I can say hetch five class equals toe next danger and then I can type your dollar.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.400
You're our message in case there is no other message.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.830
Obviously,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.140
initially there is no enmity,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.430
so this would be one visible.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.360
But once you submit the same Jason is going to be rendered and then you're going to see

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.490
that at a message.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.660
Let's save this restart,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.700
punk it Because we made some changes in our separate and go back to the browser.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.620
This would have actually loved me off.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.370
So I'm going toe longer myself.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.580
Log in again as we know it.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.540
We know Darko Secret.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.430
That's enter view.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.050
All contacts view details.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.600
Delete this,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.760
Andi.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.450
I'm gonna actually type some A s,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:04.820
dear,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.590
for whatever this is supposed to display that,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.950
um I said right below the form.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.630
Let's hope that's gonna work like that.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.310
Click on this.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.550
You can see it says you have to type that text permanently.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.160
Delete to confirm deletion.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.860
I let if that works,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.130
I'm gonna type your although I can copy and paste.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.630
But if you're using some JavaScript,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.370
you can disable the copy paste.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:24.940
Also,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.300
I'm going to stay here permanently,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.160
deal it and then click on the delete button.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.030
Hopefully that a car should be deleted from the database on.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.730
I should be redirect with the homepage.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.850
Let's click on village.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.070
If I go to the view all context,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.150
you can see that record corresponding to Kishore Kumar has been deleted.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.210
You can also go on verify the same thing in our database.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.530
So the card number to Kishore Kumar doesn't exist.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.290
After this,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.890
it's click run and you can see record number two has been deleted permanently with this.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.360
Now our delete operation,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.770
along with all the current operations,

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.950
have been completed.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.330
We can always add additional feature toe enhance the application.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.690
One such feature is to change the look and feel dynamically rather hollow the user to

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.920
change the dynamically.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.190
So in the next lecture,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:22.060
we will provide a couple of options here on the Footer so that the user can switch between

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.910
the teams.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.900
Currently,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.350
I'm using this yeti.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.160
Remember,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.330
we actually got this from boots watch dot com.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.750
So if I scroll down at the bottom,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.260
there is one called UT.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.750
So this is the one that we're using.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.720
Let's select a couple of other options like,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.420
for example,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.770
united or superhero,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.900
some of them with the different contrasts on another user toe,

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.670
choose them based on the user's choice.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.800
The team also should be applied
