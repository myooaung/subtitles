00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
in this lecture.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's shift this scored into a filter,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.360
which can intercept both our contacts,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.150
our lives as well as the edit off dead contracts are let.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.340
So let's right.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.610
Click on over that the package and say new class.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.770
And let's name the class as request toe contact filter.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.670
There is no super close to extend,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.680
but there is an interface called Filter that you need to implement.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.890
Click finish on comes with the do fetal function,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.810
which has a solid request and solid responses parameters along with the filter chain.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.600
However,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.690
the request don't get perimeter functions that were called here They come from the it's two

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.020
debates,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.950
a little request.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.310
So the first thing we will do is tow Rename these variables toe request response on Let's

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.890
call this s chain.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.550
Let's get it off the to do.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.070
A second thing that we have to do is tow contoured This request on the response into their

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.820
http questions.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.620
So I'm gonna say you're http sunlit request R e q equals toe request.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.420
Andi clips will suggest me to do a casting.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.690
Let's do the same.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.650
Let's also do the same thing with the http salad response even though we're not using the

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.050
same,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.190
it's DDB Select response.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.750
That's gonna That's rest equals toe response.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.500
Command one or control one toe at the cast.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.010
And then we now have toe copy this entire court.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.560
In fact,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.450
we can cut this entire court from here and then paste that right here.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.760
But the contact object that you created here is a local variable on.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.680
We need to make this available to our sublets on the way you do is you store this object c

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.950
in the request scope.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.300
So it's a artic u dot set attribute.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.030
That's me.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.880
The name of the scope variable s contact on the sea is the local variable that we have And

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.470
then I have to use the chain toe proceed further toe Any other filters that are available

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350
are to the actual separate.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.500
So that's done by using the do filter function.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.690
The argument is the request on response.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.850
And since I stored something in the request,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.510
the same request is going to be deceived by your some light here on from the request.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.110
I can obtain this very well.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.650
See,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.410
So to do that,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.650
let's type your contact to see equals toe that addict cast and then say altitude or get

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.950
attribute off contact.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.630
So now we can see our court is much simpler on the same thing I have to give even in the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.960
context of Let's so I'm gonna copy this code on Goto Contact Summit.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.430
So this is the section that we want toe replaced with the one that I copied.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.760
I'm gonna pasted over here.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.640
Now you can see our do post even in the other contacts,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.280
alert is much simpler.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.960
Let's save this.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.780
And one last thing that we have to do is tow.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.930
Tell this filter water the request that it is supposed to intercept so that can be done by

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.950
typing here at the rate vab a filter onda,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.350
not the filter has couple of elements.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.650
There is an element for your own patterns,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.190
but there is no element for its TDP methods because this is nothing to do with the http

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.760
protocol.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.580
So the filters are independent off the protocols.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.960
So let's use this.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.340
Ural Patterns equals toe on a day off.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.040
In our case,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.460
it's gonna be to off them.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.830
So at contacts average that is slashed at content.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.850
That's the number one your apartment that I want to intercept.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.640
And the 2nd 1 is the edit and update contacts.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.850
I'm gonna copy this and then come back to our filter based it over here.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.350
But what of them?

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.250
Have a do get and do post.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.810
So we want this to filter only if the request is opposed to request other ways.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.250
I don't want to really do anything.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.150
So what I can do that can check using the request object?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.420
If request art get matter,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.750
dark equals ignore case off post.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.790
If the answer is yes.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.820
Then do all these things.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.380
I'm gonna cut this part from here on,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.950
then paste it over here.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.100
So in case if the user is making a get request or any other request,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.360
this complete sexual ists skipped and it simply goes to the intended summit but indicated

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.550
the user has made a form submission on that happens to be post this will take place on that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.760
is only for the other contact on a little update contact.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.960
So with this now,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.710
our filter Israeli as well as our summits looked simpler on the reusable court is not

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.850
unnecessarily duplicated in multiple places.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.520
So let's say all the files restart Apache Tomcat and then go back to the browser.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.250
Let's longer first lugging with little.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.960
We know that we know Darko Secret view all contacts.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680
Let's give a picture toe Kishore.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.310
So go to the view details it it contact didn't so far so good because we made a get request

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.390
and there was no other you can check even in Eclipse Console.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.950
There is no error as such.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.910
Come back over here.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.890
Give the after as http equal and double slash cave in or dot com slash profile pictures

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.660
slash men slash two dot jpg.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.930
Let's say City is saying she moga could not to go.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.080
Andi,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.590
let's say India that saved details on Now you can see we got the details off this person.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.550
Get updated.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.770
Similarly,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.250
you can also try adding a new contact.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:08.350
Let's give forced them as John Doe as the last name John Doe at example dot com phone

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.740
number.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.740
Some arbitrary 10 digit number I'm giving after again.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.830
I'm gonna give it city people and keeping our dot com slash profile pictures slash men

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:27.260
slash Let's give it as five dot gyp IQ on probably the remaining ones I'm going to leave it

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.750
as it is.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.570
Country probably USA Click on Save Natives,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.640
another agency that we got John.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.210
Those details added to the database as well.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.500
So the filter is working.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.020
Fine,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.390
are add edit view.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.700
All of them are working.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.070
Fine.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.620
So with this now,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.650
our edit contact model is done.
