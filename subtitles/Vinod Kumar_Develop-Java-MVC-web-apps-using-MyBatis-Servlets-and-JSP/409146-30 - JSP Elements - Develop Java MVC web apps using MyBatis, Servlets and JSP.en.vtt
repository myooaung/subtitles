00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.010
in this lecture,

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.530
let's have a look at various elements in the JSP file.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.280
Number one is the static content.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.460
These are the lines of code of return for HTML CIA,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.020
says John,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.750
listed within your GST,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.190
and all the lines will be converted into a Siri's off all dot right statements inside the

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.570
resulting Delacour so they will not be processed in the Star Wars say Instead,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.250
they will be sent back to the client on the browser will handle the seat,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.050
but the most important ones are the scripting elements,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.710
which are no us to write Java code.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.840
Inside the J speak,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.950
there are three types of scripting elements.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.830
Scrip,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.250
licks,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.550
declarations and expressions.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.460
A scruple.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.940
It is a cold inside a special bracket,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.950
with start from less than percent and injured percentage agreed to them.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.420
The Jayakody right here will become part of the service function off the resulting jellicle

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.420
.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.450
Hence it has access toe all the implicit objects.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.440
The implicit objects are a bunch of standard Java objects such as requests,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.020
response,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.070
out session,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.700
etcetera.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.000
Inside this cripple it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.920
You can declare variables you can use if conditions.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.760
You can use four loops etcetera,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.270
but you cannot rate additional functions are classes because it is as if you're writing

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.660
there a function or a class insider service function,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.080
so which is what it is not alone.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
The second stripping element is the Declarations block,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.950
which is also a Java code written inside a special bracket.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.310
The bracket starts with a less than percentage exclamation,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.920
and it enjoyed their percentage greater than symbol.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.060
But the jungle call you right here becomes part of the resulting Java class and not part of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.010
the service function,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
which means you cannot write for Lupul if conditions directly,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.060
because then it looks like you're writing a follow button if condition directly inside the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.550
class.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.850
So declaration block is generally prefer to use when you want to declare a member variable

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.010
or ah,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.370
function or a nested class,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.740
all ecstatic block.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.690
Since the Cody right in the Declaration block is not part of the service function,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.350
you don't have access toe any of the implicit objects inside the declaration block.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.360
Most common use cases are toe right lifecycle functions such as J spin It and Jsp destroyed

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.360
.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.840
The third scripting element is called expressions On then Expressions is also a substitute

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.900
for some court that goes into the service function.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.250
Expressions are generally used for printing.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.630
The value of a variable or return value of a function are the fearsome expressions and you

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.240
want to print that on the HTML you can use the expressions.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.290
My expression have a simple syntax.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.550
Less than a percentage equals,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.160
and then you give the expression,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.980
then close the bracket using percentage.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.570
Great to them.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.990
Expressions have access toe all the implicit objects because they are part of the service

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.450
function.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.600
Apart from that scripting elements,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.660
which is the major part of your Jsp,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.890
you have something called directors.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.280
Now,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.910
if you're from C programming background,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.560
you know something called the pre process director,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.090
which tell the compiler before.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.620
Actually,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.930
it starts the compilation.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.960
Likewise,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.600
the directors instruct the JSP translator before it can begin the translation of the JSP

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.450
into Java.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.540
They can affect the actual source scored off the JSP itself.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.570
So a directive basically has the syntax off less than percentage at followed by name of the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.350
director and then a bunch off a tribute in the form off key value pairs.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.090
The most commonly used directors are page include on Tablet,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.510
a page basically controls the appearance of the page.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.210
For example,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.360
if you want to import some packages other than job ordered Lang.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.180
Additionally,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.960
you can control the page,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.610
including whether recession object will require out,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.330
not in case if there was an exception in a JSP page where it should be redirected.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.650
Toe.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.460
All those things are controlled is in the page.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.350
But the most common use of the page directive is for importing classes from other packages

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.800
that included Ricky is used for including any extra within your application,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.390
while the page directly can be given anywhere in the Jase.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.750
Define the include director because it includes the content of the other files.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.450
The placement of include is very important because the inclusion off other fires happen

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.790
even before the actual translation begins.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.980
Many of the occasions this is called as ecstatic includes on the third most commonly used

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.490
to director is the tag lib director.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.640
As the name suggests,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.830
it represents tag library That tags we're talking about here are nothing but the JSP tax,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.310
which are not the it's team attacks so they can be processed by the browser,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.150
so the tags are going to be processed in the Jsp engine itself.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.990
But in order to refer Toa any time exploded by third party,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.350
we have to use this tablet directive.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.950
So general syntax is you say haggling and then you are equals toe given name space

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.650
representing all the tanks and then a perfect student full toe the tax So the next The Jsp

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.550
element is called JC actions.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.550
They're actually call actions because they perform some actions.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.520
But behind the thing they're nothing but J speed tanks.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.610
There are two types standard actions which are standardized by Jolla community process on

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.850
the 2nd 1 is custom actions.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.600
Now the standard actions.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.270
You don't have to include any additional John finds.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.170
Are any TIG libraries?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.680
You can simply start using the Jays feast under tax,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.230
using the JSP as the prefix.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.390
Most of the times we don't have any really requirements off this.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.750
In the modern JSP,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.090
custom actions are actions or JSP tax created by developers.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.050
Hence it's called custom because we're past amazing our own actions.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:06.000
These are no us to create a Java class on use the Java class as a tag in the initial days

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.920
of jsp,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.170
a free more call about his tricks provided a lot off tags,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.410
which are meant for programming purposes.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.960
For example,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.000
if you want a far group instead of reading a script lit and read a foreign group,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.350
you can actually use a J Street tag.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.000
They look like HTML tags,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.350
so you use a tag toe.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.190
Repeat over a collection.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.560
During those days about your stretch became very popular,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.270
and in the next portion of J Spirit is JSP 2.0.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:40.410
They introduced a bunch of tax called Js steel because we're writing applications on Apache

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:47.770
Tomcat nine with support JSP 2.0 jail speak and also have expression language or he'll for

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.830
Sharp and then Js steel.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.940
So the other additional two elements off JST,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.680
which completely replaced writing off script lids,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.630
declaration the expressions within our JSP,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.200
an expression language has a very simple syntax off dollar and a cuddly bracket,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.840
and as the name suggests,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.910
you write some expressions did.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.600
For example,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.610
accessing the value of variable are probably property of an object are eternally operator

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.680
like question mark colon combination JST L is the JSP standard tag liberally,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.850
which allows us to do a lot of things,

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.330
is in J spit tags,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.190
which otherwise we would have done you things.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.160
Triplets declaration that expressions.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.690
In the subsequent lectures,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.250
we will have a leader looking toe expression,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.550
language as well as Js steel.
