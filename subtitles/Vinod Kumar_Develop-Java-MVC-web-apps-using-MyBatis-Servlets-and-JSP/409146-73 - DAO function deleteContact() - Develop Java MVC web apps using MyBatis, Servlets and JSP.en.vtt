00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
know that our application has I'd contact,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.040
view,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.950
contact view all contacts as the last modified contact.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.850
Let's also try to provide a delete contract option.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.060
So we're gonna provide a button over here that says delete contact details taking on which

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.450
it should ask a confirmation from the user so that accidental billiards can be avoided.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.630
There are a couple off ways you can do that.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.050
One of the method is where you papa bear,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.290
alert our dialogue box and then ask the user,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.050
Are we sure we want toe do that?

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.800
Andi,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.170
if the user says yes,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.350
then you can proceed for there to deal it.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.950
Here is an example from YouTube.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.570
This is one off my repository on.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.910
If I go to the settings on and scroll down at the bottom,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.750
you can see that there is an option called the Delete This repository.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.960
When I take on this button,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.390
you can see that there is a dialogue,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.820
books that comes up when it is.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.540
This action cannot be undone.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.120
And this is gonna permanently delete the repository and every other resource associated

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.520
with that.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.750
And I have to manually type this enter text.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.450
This is a wide Any militias boats toe perform the village operations.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.400
So unless I type exactly as well is tight door here.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.550
So this is not going to be deleted.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.200
Similarly,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.420
here is another example.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.350
I have a course here on if I want to delete this course from this platform,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.270
I have a button hear clicking on which it shows me a few options.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.950
One of them happens to be the delete this product.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.220
When I click on that,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.720
you can see another ballot box comes and then says,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.030
Hey,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.150
are actually one of permanently delete this.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.840
And then,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.650
if so,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.170
I have to type your delete and then confirm anything else I typed.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.350
The button is disabled,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.170
so these are a few options that we can think off in our application.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.500
What we're gonna do is provide a button here on clicking this button.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.050
We should get another screen where it shows few details off this contact and then ask the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.720
user toe,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.050
enter the phrase permanently delete,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.550
and only after user types there and clicks on the button.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.600
Then we're gonna delete that,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.730
which means deleting is a two step process.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.400
One is a get request,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.640
and now there is a post request in the next couple off lectures.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.240
Let's handle this enter scenario to begin with in this lecture.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.850
Let's address the DEA well part of it.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.530
So let's go back toe clips on,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.500
then opened the deal.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.350
That's the contact deal.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.040
We have the create read update for here.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.390
So let's also add one more function after the update on this is also going to be a wide

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.010
function.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.910
Let's call it us.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.290
Delete contact on then the argument that this would be an integer idee on within the other

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.290
.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.750
An annotation here at the rate delete on.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.750
You need to get this from the my back this package.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.320
Onda Let's right the SQL delete statement like this.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.410
So it's gonna be a deal.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.690
It from contacts where I equals toe hash idee and now over dear oh,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.190
function.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.150
It's also ready.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.790
In the next lecture,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.480
let's read the service function that does some validation and then in walks dysfunction
