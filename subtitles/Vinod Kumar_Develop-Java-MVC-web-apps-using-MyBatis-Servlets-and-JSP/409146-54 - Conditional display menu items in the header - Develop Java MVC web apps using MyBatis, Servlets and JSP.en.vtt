00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
in this lecture based on the user's log in status.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.920
Let's conditionally display these men items for that.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.940
Let's go to the header Dajae SPF and close all other fights.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.070
We need to write an if condition based on whether the user has logged me.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.650
Not not,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.230
but we don't want today the Java code here,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.690
and that is where Js steel comes into picture.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.720
Now J.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.950
Steele has two tags which allows us to conditionally render some HTML content.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.570
Number one is the sequel and if which is only foreign,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.480
if condition,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.350
there is no else fall of it.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.850
Whereas if you want that it felt kind off solution,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.790
then you have to use something called Sequel and choose and then you can view multiple

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.060
conditions inside that this time let's are just the issue using sequel.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.220
And if the first thing you do is tow the target directive less than percentage at Tagle it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.770
you are equals two and then wait for a second.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.160
If you don't get this intelligent,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.460
you press controlled space,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.250
sell it the Jsp J steel core and then press enter perfect equals toe.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.930
See,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.550
that is the preferred perfect.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.180
And now I come down here and make some room.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.670
So this is supposed to be one condition on this is supposed to be inside another condition

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.670
.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.530
The condition I have to use here is session scooped out.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.620
User Equal Streak wants to know.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.970
That means there is no user logging,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.470
so we need to render this.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.440
But if the user has already logged in,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.140
then this is the one that I have to give.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.640
So it's very simple.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.740
We're gonna type your sequel and if and the conditions should be given as a test.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.290
So this is how you need to view the same thing I'm also going to give here.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.250
This is the complement recondition that we may have to give you,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.000
Which means if I given here some condition,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060
it's the exact opposite conditioner to give.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.320
So the condition here is dollar session scope dot user equals to know.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.040
But as here,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.900
I had to give the condition Eyes not equals to know.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.320
So let's copy paste the same thing and type you're not equals to know.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.850
Bend the law goat.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.730
So let's former the same.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.550
Save it.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.240
Restart the server,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.470
go back to the browser,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.840
refresh the page ones are probably go to the home,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.520
and now you can see we got register and log in because our server God restarted.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.770
The user has been removed from the station,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.500
so I see a register and log in.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.670
Let's go to the log in and then type the user name as we know I'd be no dot co.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.550
And then the password is secret.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.660
Click on Logging on.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.090
Now you can see that the register and Logan has gone and la goat has come back.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.450
So even if I typed manually here logging press enter,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.690
you can see I'm taken back to the dash more likely for type your register and press enter.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.370
You can see I'm taken back to the dashboard again.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.810
So the only way you can go back to the register form now is toe kick on the la goat and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.130
then click the register button.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.490
You may also see that there is an additional pipe here.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.230
This is because in the head,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.170
a large a SPF I have an additional pipe.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.050
Let's get it off that save it,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.620
come back and do a refresh.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.680
You should not see that that's gone on.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.120
And of course,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.820
if I log in with the proper email and password,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.290
you can see our header is displaying the links properly.
