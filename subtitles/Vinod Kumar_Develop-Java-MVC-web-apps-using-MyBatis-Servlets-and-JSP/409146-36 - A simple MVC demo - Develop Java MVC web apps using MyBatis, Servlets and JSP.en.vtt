00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
to bring the best off cigarettes and jsp.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.260
Let's make use off something called NBC or model view controller.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.950
M V C is an architectural pattern which emphasizes on separation off constants.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.750
Every claim request visits a sunlit which access what is called controller.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.840
It's only job is to co ordinate between other components off your applications,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.670
such as deer or classes of service classes,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.470
and then J space toe produce an HTML output.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.320
Typically,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.950
the controller has few responsibilities,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.800
such as read the inputs coming from the it's TTP client,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
such as request perimeters or cookies are Session 90 are hits,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.290
TDP headers,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.620
etcetera and then identify an appropriate model which happens to be a service.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.560
Are ideal object on in work a function on the same get.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.170
The data are typically in the form off either a single entity object or a collection off

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.080
entity Objects store that in the request cope and then forward toe Jsp,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.580
which acts as the view A J speed responsibility,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.600
is only toe collect the later in the request scope for made that and produce and it's team

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.470
or put give the control back to the separate and then they suffered which is the controller

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.730
gives the HTML back to the client to implement this.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.070
Where an example.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.650
We will also make yourself my betters.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.010
So first thing first,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.090
let's add My bite is dependency toe are bombed or XML.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.030
I'm gonna open the palm.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.360
The XML here we have a bunch of dependence is already.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.990
Let's go to the browser.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.860
Goto May 1 central or envy and deposited outcome.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.750
Search for my buddies opened the very 1st 1 Get the latest portion,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.430
which is three dot fighter for copy the dependency examine.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.970
Come back to Eclipse based it formatted and save it on.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.680
As you can see,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.350
that under libraries may,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.310
when dependencies has all the dependencies that we have listed out toe represent their data

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.700
in this particular table.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.120
Let's create an entity class called customer with Eylea Name Citi email phone as respective

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.770
films.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.550
So I'm gonna go back right click on into the package.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.990
New Plus let's name it as customer defined the fields,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.850
which are private indeed your I d and the rest of them are all string.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.950
So I have named you made phone and city.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.650
The order doesn't really matter.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.560
It's also hard.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.950
Uh,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.480
no argument.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.610
Constructor Onda Get doesn't sitters That's a the file on Let's Create an interface,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.180
which has a function toe.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.850
Get all the customers.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.500
So let's call the interface as customer deal,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.650
so I'm going to right click on one other package.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.750
New interface.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.700
This is our mapper into face for my batters.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.540
The strain.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.300
The package Name.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.120
First toe.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.900
Deol.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.550
Call it US customer deal.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.690
Click finish.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.340
Typically,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.880
a deal should have read operations and many qualities I'm only going toe earlier.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.170
One.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.510
Quite a function which is going to give me a list off customer objects.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.080
Let's call it us.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.110
Get all customers Import list and customers list is supposed to be imported from Java.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.110
Util Customer is automatically imported from entity and let's also our advocate select

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.670
annotation toe map.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.380
This toe SQL Select statement at the Red Select Annotation comes from a party,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.150
My buddies,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.200
The quality is going to be very simple.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.220
Select star from customers.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.010
Let's say this toe provide an implementation for this customer Delwar interface.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.080
Let's make use off my batters so I'm going toe right click on the deal package New Class.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.860
This is going to be our deal Factory class Andi.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.240
Let's also make this is the final plus click finish to ensure that this cannot be instance

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.660
hated.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.680
Let's add a private constructor.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.250
We're doing this as a good practice.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.950
Let's provide a public static customer deal.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.400
That's the interface that we want.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.900
Toe return an object off that Kalidas get customer vehicle,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.260
which is supposed to take the help off my buddies and return a customer deal.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.100
Object.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.940
My bed is depends on a configuration five.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.650
The name of the file can be anything.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.430
I don't have that file yet,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.760
but I'm gonna create one.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.800
Let's say I'm gonna create a file called my betters conflict dot XML and I want to get an

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.210
input stream representing the theme for this I can say input stream I s equals toe

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.240
resources Dart get resource as stream aan den.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.750
The name of the file is supposed to be my bestest dash conflict dot xml It's important

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.270
pushed him from Java.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.280
Are you with this input stream?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.220
We can now create a session factory.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.780
So with a SQL session factory that's Commodus factory equals toe new SQL session,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.880
factory builder dot build and then we supply the inputs team that we have just created with

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.550
this factory.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.120
Now we can create an SQL session object.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.500
Let's call it a station equals toe factory door Open session.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.750
Let's import SQL Titian from my body's a p A.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.860
Now that we have the decision,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.820
we can create a custom will be able instance and return the same.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.690
So I'm going to say here,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.990
written session,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:51.060
don't get mapper and then say that we want an instance off Customer deal mapper interface

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.630
notice We are also supposed to handle the exceptions Over here we can simply throw it away

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.470
from this.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.520
So whoever is calling this get customer beer will may have toe handle the same.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.560
Let's also quickly create this file in our resources sections.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.180
I'm gonna go right click on SRC Main Resources New.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.000
I want to create a file that is not listed here.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.450
I go to other under General,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.620
we can select file and face the name of the file that we wanted to create Click Finish.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.710
It's going toe open a text editor and I'm gonna paste the XML from our previous examples

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.060
that we discussed in the my body section.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.700
Let's say this So with this now,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.410
we have completed our model section.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.830
And now let's create the controller,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.050
which is a separate to do so Let's right click on the package over here and then create a

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.430
new class and there's going to be my thundered plus So I'll call this as get customers.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.800
Select Super Class is going to be http starlet Click finish.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.570
Let's add the deformed serial wash annuity as a good practice and over it the do get matter

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.250
to handle the client request.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.600
So I goto source over implement methods Select Do get click OK,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.250
get it off these two lines.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.740
This being a controller,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.560
we're gonna produce any HTML output here,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.310
so we don't have to say response towards set content type or we don't have to say response

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.310
.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.440
Don't get writer.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.370
Typically,

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.480
a controller has four responsibilities.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.490
Number one read all input data from the request,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.290
such as request perimeters or headers or cookies.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.280
In our case,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.180
we simply want to get the list off all customers so we don't have any inputs coming from

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.750
the browser.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.650
A second responsibility is toe identify a suitable model object.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.240
In our case,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.240
it's going to be the customer dio object on in work,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.110
a function so that we can get the model later.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:57.150
The third responsibility is to store that in a scope such as a request cope and then 4th 1

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.090
is toe forward to an appropriate view,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.470
which is the JSP.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.040
So let's do the same things.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.150
I'm gonna go say here,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:09.710
Customer dear Will Delwar equals toe deal factory dot get customer dear.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.990
Oh,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.280
I remember this trust and I o exception.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.300
But incidently the do get function also says throws are you exception?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.320
And that is why,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.180
even though it is a checked exception being thrown,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.380
it's not causing any problem over here.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.710
Let me full screen this.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.540
Now that we have their deal,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.390
we want the list off all customers.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:35.190
I'm going to simply say list equals toe Delwar dot Get all customers listening to be

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.980
created as an object off Java util dot list Let's press command one or control one on

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.590
Windows Press enter.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.030
So our first to task.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.520
As for us,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.680
this particular controller is done now.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.200
The second task is to store this in request scope,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.250
and that's a simple assed request.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:57.920
Are said attribute given name here or they take customers And then what do you want to

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.260
store?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.700
Which is nothing with the list off customers?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.830
And the final step here is toe forward.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.870
This particular request toe the view which is going to be our JC.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.740
I don't have a JSP yet,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.170
but assume that the name of the JSP it's called show Customers start GSP.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:21.220
Let's forward this request to the same Let's type request art get request dispatcher on the

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.450
name of the file is gonna be slashed.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:31.300
Show customers dot jsp and then we have to save forward this request and the rest wants

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.950
object.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.670
Since we are forwarding with this particular request object which contains the attribute

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.950
here called customers,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:46.040
this JSP can loop over this customers and then display each off them as Rose.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.510
Let's say this create this jsp So I'm gonna go back to my lab folder,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.750
right click and I say new jsp Fine.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:02.060
I'm gonna face the name of the file show customers are jsp click finish and this is where

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.760
we need to know Display the list off customers.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.460
So let's change the title as customer list give the same thing as hitch one.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:18.980
Also they had a horizontal rule that's had a paragraph NBC demo Pullard by summits,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.240
Jsp and my buddies to display the customer later.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.450
Let's add a table for the time being.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:35.070
That's also say border equals to one table is gonna have a T head on the body in the P head

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.070
.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:42.490
We're gonna have the heading Roso 30 are with that safety hatch Islay slash t hedge

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.710
Similarly,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:49.570
that also have the same thing for name city email on a phone number.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.080
However,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.790
the tea body is supposed to be filled with Rose that is coming from the list,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.220
and the list is stored in the request.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.650
Cope as customers,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.750
so toe loop over that customers.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.700
We can simply use Js steel.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.630
However,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.150
the JSTOR libraries need to be added or pond or XML.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.220
So let's go to the bomb.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.340
The victims Gloria.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.450
Let's go back toe the May 1 repository Look for Js steel.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.810
J still is a standard a PS,

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.200
so you only get a bunch off into faces Over here,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.090
it's like the wonder to worsen.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.410
Copy the dependencies.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:38.020
Come back door Palmdale XML based over here But this a p A specification is implemented by

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.010
different vendors.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.900
Since you're using Apache Tomcat.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.840
Let's get the one from Apache,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.400
which is called Standard,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.880
So I'm gonna look for standard over here.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.230
You can see it is Apache Standard tag labor,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.450
early implementation.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.740
Let's like the latest portion of this implementation.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.580
Copy this.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.250
Come back over here.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.510
Added to the list of dependencies.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.790
Former save.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:06.890
Now you'll see that we have additional libraries corresponding toe Js steel as well.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.220
Let's go back to the jsp.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:09.800
Andi.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.480
Here is where we want toe loop over the customers collection in the request scope to make

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:21.900
use of the jail steel we need to ruffle toe the tag library and where you do is by adding

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:28.710
this directive less than percentage at tag lib ur equals two.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.140
And if you wait for a second,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.780
you'll see that you get a list off all the name spaces.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.430
The one that we want to use is the core Js Steel libraries,

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:46.330
which is coming from this particular name space Select that the perfect suggest er is see,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.930
that's like the same thing.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:54.350
And now I can come down here and then say here c colon and then press controls presidency.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:01.040
Each of the J still times on the one that I want is sequel and Forage The sequel and Forage

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.280
depends on a collection or a string.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.000
I have a collection in my request.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.380
Cope.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.410
I can stay here.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.800
Items equals toe dollar.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.490
Either I can say request cope dot our state of a customers.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.110
Only thing is that in this case,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.790
it first checks in the page scope only if it is not that it's going to check in the request

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.210
cope.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.370
Since we very well know that it's there in the request Cope,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.620
you can always say requests scoped our customers.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.920
This is going to be the source collection,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.450
but we want to pick one customer at a time.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.030
And,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.450
uh,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.060
customer that were picked up.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.730
We want toe.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.580
Name it us.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.660
Let's say C don't confuse that with this sea because this is only used as a perfect

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.520
suffered tag.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.650
But this is just a variable that we can use it with our expression language.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.400
So let's go Another tr over here,

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.250
the fear is gonna have five TD's corresponding toe each one off this.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:01.800
Let's a TD and then say dollar si dot i d,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.870
which is nothing but seed out.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.790
Get I d.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.330
So I'm gonna copy this and then paste it for more times.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.760
Change each one of them,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.790
toe the respective properties.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.930
Nothing but get to name.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.160
This would be city representing.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.300
Get Citi email for get email and phone for get phone.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.150
One last thing we have to do is tow associate this solid with a Ural pattern.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.160
We can do that either using an XML or with an addition.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.530
An addition is much simpler and let before the same.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:41.720
Let's give here at the rate Web separate and the fighting that I'm gonna give as view

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.740
customers.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.340
We can also provide a hyperlink in our home page so that when we click on that,

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.030
the control comes to here.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.760
To do that.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.310
Let's go to the index start.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.070
It's TML.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.300
Let's add a hyperlink over here.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.450
Do slash Do on.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.290
I'll take a hit.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.750
Sheriff equals toe dark slash view customers.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.040
And then I say,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.570
view space customers that the caption now that our application is really let's write,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.810
take on a project under on the same.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.780
But I see an editor over here,

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.780
and if you see the other is because of the pond or examine You can also look at the same

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:22.860
thing in the markers over here you can see may when dependency it is missing Artifact Java

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.860
ex assembler jsp j still is missing.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.590
So it says that this dependency could not be found so you can go and have a look at the

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.940
same thing over there.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.650
I looked for Js steel.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:41.590
This is the one that we picked up You can see here The jar is not available so let's not

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.270
use this.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:48.560
Let's search it again Js steel and sell it the 2nd 1 even though it raise your bid artifact

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.320
is more too soon.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.470
So that's still select this wonder too.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.340
Copy this You can see here we have a job.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.670
Fine.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.840
I'm gonna replace this with this one.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.960
Save it.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.350
You can see that Jay Steal John has been downloaded.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.780
Now let's go to our project.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.500
Right click Run as run on,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:07.720
sir.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.170
One by default.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.420
Little open the index dot html file on the browser.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:18.220
We have this view customers clicking that link will take me to the separate Separate will

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:23.460
talk to the modern which is our deal object which is provided by my buddies That gives me

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.870
their data,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.520
which is the modern.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.900
Later the summit stores inadequate scope goes to the JSP.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.740
Jsp produces that output.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.070
So hopefully everything is okay.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:36.170
Let's click on this to see and you can see that we got the output from our application.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.340
So if you go back over here,

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.930
the sunlit has absolutely no HTML core,

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.900
and the JSP has absolutely no job accord in it.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.840
Also,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.710
if you go to the sub,

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.530
let the sunlight doesn't take the responsibility off talking to the D B.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.390
It's been handed over to someone else,

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.250
So we have different clear cut separation off concerns.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:04.130
One last thing let's have a look at it is if I run this particular JSP directly like this

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.500
by right clicking Rana's run on sorrow,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.800
you'll see that we got an empty table.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:16.720
That's because the output is produced directly from Jsp and the JSP doesn't talk to the DPJ

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.050
sweeter than popular model.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:24.870
So we actually don't have any data in the JSP because of which we practically never access

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.020
the G XP directly.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.140
If you want to restrict the user not to access the JSP,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.620
the best way to do is tow put that in a folder inside the vagina.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:39.260
Because Webber enough is a hidden folder in new users can access them directly,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:45.220
but suddenly being an object inside the bunker container that can actually access that.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.300
So what I do that moderate click on the Robaina create a new folder?

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.090
Generally,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.310
this is called The Views are pages.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.670
Let me give it as views take finish and then I'm gonna drag this show customers jsp into

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.240
the Views folder.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.170
Obviously,

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.440
now the sunlit is also supposed to be changed because the currently the Separated actually

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.470
going to the show custom Ajay,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.090
Spin the root off your application,

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.210
which is the Web app.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.190
But I am supposed to now give your slash Web dash in F.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:20.780
It is case sensitive slash views slash show customers jsp.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.510
So let's save this.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:28.850
If I go to the JSP directly and then right click run as run on server,

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:36.040
you will see that you get an ETA better for not for because inside the web and if you can

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.960
access anything from the browser,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.470
so the only way you can access the details of the customer will now be by either going to

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:51.190
the homepage are manually typing this as view dash customers like this and then get the

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.980
actual data.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.120
As you can see,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.420
the sunlit is able to access the JSP,

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.360
get the generated HTML and give it back to me.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.090
But I,

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:00.960
as a user,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.040
can access the JSP directly because it's inside a hidden folder.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.160
So this is how you work with model view controller application.
