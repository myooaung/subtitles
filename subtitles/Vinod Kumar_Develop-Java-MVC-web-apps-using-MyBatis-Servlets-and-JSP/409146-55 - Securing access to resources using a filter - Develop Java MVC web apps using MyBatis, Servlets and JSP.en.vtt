00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
now that we have log in Lagos and register in place in this little let's see how to secure

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.400
other resources that we're going to develop in the future.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.020
We already have one resource which requires log in that is the dashboard.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.960
For example,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.890
If I go to the address bar here and then type dashboard myself and then press enter,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.750
you can see that I'm redirected back to the homepage.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.510
Ideally,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.740
I should be taken to the log in page and that can be done simply by going to the dashboard

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.740
.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.310
Settle it.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.200
You can see here in the do gate,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.100
we are actually checking with the user is logged in or not,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.840
And if the user is not logged in,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.180
we are actually redirecting the other to the homepage.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.000
But instead I can simply say your dot,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.010
slash logging.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.220
Let's save this restart,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.230
dunk it and then go back to the browser again.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.900
If I tried the same thing by typing dashboard here manually and press enter,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.910
you can see that I'm taken to the log in for from no one.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.640
Whatever the subject that we're gonna rate for managing the contacts off the currently

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.560
logged in user if the user has not logged in,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.420
the user has to be taken to the log in page just like this,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.820
which means this core is common for a lot of other settlements.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.080
Instead of repeating the same court in multiple places,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.950
we can make it of the sublet filter toe.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.850
Address the issue.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.570
So let's get a filter called Log in check filter and shift this cord into that to do so.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.960
Let's right click on the package New Class and I'm going toe type the name of the class as

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.980
log in check filter,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.240
unlike the previous classes,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.900
will be used.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.680
Toe extend a class called http Sublet This time our classes supposed to implement an

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.950
interface called Filter.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.540
So I'm going to click on the add button and then say Filter.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.040
I feel that is supposed to come from Java extorts tablet package,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.990
click OK,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.300
and then click Finish.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.990
Here is the do filter that gets executed for every sunlit request that this filter

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.750
intercepts.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.700
Let's get it off this doodle.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.600
But only one thing is here.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.760
The argument of the subway request,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.830
whereas the sub let's receive an argument health.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.780
It's TDP sell it request also the get session is a function available only in the HDTV

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.090
standard request interface,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.050
not in the salad request.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.840
Let's quickly change the name of these arguments.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.840
Toe R e q r E s p on.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.950
Then let's call it s Chain and convert Selectric questions Separate response in tow.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.950
Their http counterparts on that is done by simply assigning to a variable off http salad

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.190
request and then doing a cast similarly for its treaty presented just once.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.280
So I'll tell your http starlet request,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.190
Let's call it as request equals two R E Q.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.240
Let's import.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.170
It's really bizarre Request from Java extort Sandler Dotage TV package The secondary is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.480
that it needs the casting.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.050
So let's add the casting also on the same thing I have to do for its GDP.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:12.320
Sublet response response equals toe R E s P press Command one or control one toe,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.850
import it and then again command one or controlled one toe at the cast.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.270
Now that I got the request of response like this,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.920
I think we have to check whether the user has logged in a Not so The court is already

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.610
available in our dashboard seller.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.590
I'm gonna cut that court from here and then come back and then face the court after this

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.250
statement.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.610
Let's format it,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.940
but the request object is named here as request,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.510
not Arctic.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.880
U R A.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.130
Q.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.930
Still responsible salad request.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.390
So I just have to change the valuable name toe request and then say Get station does Nora.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.420
Similarly,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.450
Century Direct is available only in the it's TDP sublet response.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.960
So let's use that variable on,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.910
then call that function so the filter will now take her off chicken if the user is no,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.720
then redirecting to the log in page.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.780
But if the user is not a constant,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.670
that means the youth that has already logged in.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.460
We now have to let to the filter chain take care off.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.350
Passing the control to the next filter available are the intended separate,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.160
and that is done by just going and typing here,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.790
chained out Do filter.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.570
Nowadays,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.710
you can supply the request in the form of salad.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.070
Requests are extremely presented.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.730
Request border variables representing the same object,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.830
so it doesn't matter.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.150
One thing that we have to do is now we have to tell the Fintor water the request that it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.350
supposed to intercept it?

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.960
That can be done in two ways.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.170
Number one is using an annotation.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.540
Number two is going to the web dot XML and then adding appropriate XML content since we're

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.100
following annotations everywhere.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.900
So let's also use an annotation.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.820
The innovation is called moderate van filter,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.900
which takes your importance as an element which is supposed to be an area of strings.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.330
If you have only one your apartment,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.040
then you can just give it a bulk order text.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.730
Otherwise,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.100
we are going to give an array,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.410
since I'm gonna have a lot of you other patterns united once.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.400
Let's use in our A.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.490
The 1st 1 that I want toe protect is slash dashboard as in when be right new subjects that

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.080
record authentication we simply come here on the corresponding urine patterns are the names

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.130
of the sublet that format.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.210
Save Onda Restart,

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.870
dunk it,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.200
notice in the dashboard sunlight.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.530
We have removed that court,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.390
but still,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.690
if I goto home on,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.340
then go here and then type dashboard manually.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.260
Press enter.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.910
You can see that it still takes me to the log in page because this time the filter checks.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.390
If the user has logged in which the user is not on automatically redirects.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.750
They use it to the logging pitch.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.510
And now,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.310
if I log in here by typing the valid email and password,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.730
click logging on notice.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.520
The request to the dashboard is still going through the filter.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.180
The filter knows that the user has already logged in it simply Lex,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.850
the actual dashboards under to do its job.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.060
So one thing to keep in mind now is that every diamond moderator new resource that requires

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.960
a temptation.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.870
I had to come to the log in check,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.230
filter and add a comma and then a double college text representing the U.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.530
R L pardon corresponding to that particular sunlit.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.360
So that's all in this lecture.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.330
In the next few lectures,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.330
let's address adding a new contract for the logged in user.
