00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.230
now that our application is really one last thing that we will do is tow provide an option

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.690
it off,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.290
footer somewhere here for the user toe,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.640
select a different look and feel for the application.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.320
But this should happen dynamically,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.530
which means that if the user is going to say this is a team that I want from that point

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.970
until they you the changes,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.670
the team should remain the scene.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.120
And currently we're using a team called ET and the team is nothing with the bootstrap start

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.760
Mindo RCs is that we have used in the energy SPF.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.120
.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.850
They've opened that you can see we have given here a link.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.570
Rarely constant style sheets type equals toe text slash CSS.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.520
But importantly,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.440
the HF corresponds to bootstrap Dharmindo CSS,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.650
which is available under our assets slash times.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.970
Obviously,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.320
when the user makes a selection,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.260
we have to change this dark CSS file.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.560
We can make it off the cookies for the same.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.320
Currently I only one single file here Bootstrap Dharmindo,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.970
CSS.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.860
Let's add a couple off more by going toe this boots,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.950
watch dot com and then scroll down and choose three or four different teams off your choice

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.950
.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.550
So I'm gonna select this one because that had a totally different look compared to the one

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.160
that we have.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.900
Let's click on download,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.230
and it's gonna don't load that with the same name.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.360
Bootstrap got Min dirty assists.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.780
But since I already have bootstrapped minorities is under old styles,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.850
it's giving a different name.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.830
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change this name.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.140
Toe bootstrap dot united dot and then min dot CSS over here,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.450
that's kicks in.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.700
Likewise,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.040
I'm gonna download superhero Same way I'm gonna rename this as Bush about superhero dark

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.380
mindo.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.840
TSS will be one more.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.150
Let's click this pulse download again.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.400
I'm gonna rename this as boots.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.050
Stop dot bulls dot men dot CSS on one.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.540
Last probably is darkly Let's click,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:19.540
download and change the name toe would step dot darkly dark mindo TSS No days for 80.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.290
We still have the name as bootstrap Darkman dot CSS It didn't change this one.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.030
So let's first refresh the styles holder so that the list off all the files are visible

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.850
over here on Well,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.240
really,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.550
In this bootstrap dot mindo CS is toe deity.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.560
So I'm gonna press f two here are you can rightly condense a refectory ning.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.080
So I'm gonna rename.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.380
This is bootstrap dot u t dot mindo thesis Let's click OK and quickly changed that over

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.950
here.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.890
Otherwise you will see that the styling would be removed.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.230
But this has to be dynamic,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.020
which means that we have to use some kind of jaycee expression here toe replace this part

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.240
with the team that we're using.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.450
Let's come back and do that in a bit.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.140
But first,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.130
let's go to the foot R J SPF and add a couple of links over there,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.600
so that user has an option to change the team.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.520
So I'm gonna open the food order Jay Speer.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.450
This is where I have the copyright.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.510
So I'm gonna diss,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.860
press,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.370
enter,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.120
make some room here,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.550
give another do,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.020
and inside this Do I want to have a couple of hyperlinks,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.090
So I'm gonna go give your A head chef equals toe dark slash team cushion mark.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.560
Name equals two.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.870
Let's give 80 and then I'll type yeti in Paschal case.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.280
Let's give a separator.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.810
Let's copy this and paste four more times and change each one off this toe match.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.510
This particular text over here,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.350
so I have darkly pulled superhero united.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:06.950
I'm gonna change this toe darkly and let me remove the last pipe and also a texture to say

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.250
that choose one of the teams.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.000
So when the user clicks on this hyperbole,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.970
it is supposed to go to a serverless,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.010
a program called Team Supposed to be a sublet,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.790
and I don't have any started for this year old better,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.040
but let's give it a try by going to our phone book application.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.250
Right click.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.870
Run as Run on,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.830
Sir would on in the browser you can see in the foot or we have something called Changed him

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.830
.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.960
80 Darkly Superhero Paulison United Clicking on which right now I'm only going to get the

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.700
for Not for because the page doesn't exist corresponding to this year old pattern.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.570
So let's go quickly.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.310
Create a sunlit under the package.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.710
That's right.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.160
Click and say,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.980
New Plus.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.930
Let's call it as change team starlet Super class is gonna be It's TTP.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.060
Sell it as usual,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.450
click finish on an an addition here for mapping the Europe Latin,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:15.070
which is called several it The euro pattern is slash team at the default cereal wash 90 as

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.120
always for the best practice on the do get because we are associating this sunlit with

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.920
hyperlink.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.000
So it has to be.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.430
Do get get it off these two lines.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.340
Andi,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.710
this is where I need to read the name off the team.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.780
That user resending which is a paramedical mean.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.670
So let's go in here and type.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.030
String team equals toe request art,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:46.150
get perimeter off name and all I have to do now is to store this text in the form of a

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.450
cookie and send it back.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.240
And if you want the cookie to be remembered forever,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.280
then probably create a persistent cookie which last for a longer period of time,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.530
like a year also and send it back to the browser on the header should read this team and

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.810
then apply the appropriate styling.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.900
That's all what we have to do.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.960
So first,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.280
I'm gonna create a cookie.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280
So it's a cookie.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.230
C one equals toe new cookie Onda cookie needs to be imported on.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.250
The constructor has two parameters,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.390
so I'm gonna give the team as the cookie name and team variable is the value in getting the

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.290
user restraint to Manila Tate that over here on that is not one off these like ASD

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.200
something Obviously the cookie will be stored with dark name on the head of restraint to

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.550
look for Bush shirt Dark A s Didot min doc CSS,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.550
which doesn't exist.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:44.540
Say that a good idea toe check if the team that is coming here is one of the team that I

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.290
already have.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.840
So what we do is we're gonna create a list off all the teams that we have in the form of a

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.590
collection.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.910
So I'm gonna type here,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.140
are a start as list and then do a list off teams that we have.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.590
So which is a Yeti?

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:10.000
United superhero pulls Andi darkly listed to be created off type job order beauty alert

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.280
list.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.230
Let's toe the same thing before we can assigned to this.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.860
Now I can check if the list contains what,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.760
the team that the uterus ending then No problem.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.760
But if it's equals two false,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.190
that means the user has time to something manually on.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.220
That is not one off these on.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.520
Let's assume Yeti is the default one.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.360
So I'm gonna say your team equals toe yeti with this.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.530
Well,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.130
aeration,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.820
the cookie that contains the team is always going to be one off this.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.250
Let's also are the age of the cookie as an year.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.650
So I'm gonna say your C one dot set max age.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.660
So let's say 365 days in tow,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.980
24 hours into 60 minutes into 60 seconds.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.810
If you want 10 years,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.280
then just want to play this with 10.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.200
Next,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.740
we have to send this back to the browser by adding that in the response,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.070
I'm gonna say you're rescue dot I had a cookie off.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.750
See one.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.080
After this,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.790
you have to render some page back to the user by default.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.960
A solar doesn't produce any output.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.330
So if I just believe that as it is now,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.610
the user will get a blank page.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.110
Obviously,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.880
we don't want that,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.900
So let's redirect the user back toe the homepage by typing respite art.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.970
Send redirect to dot,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.020
slash and now over some.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.190
It is really,

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.380
however,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.470
in the header,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:46.950
we need toe read the cookie that were stored and then change the link to the bootstrap dot

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.900
mindo CSS.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.090
And that's very simple.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.900
Let's go to the head.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:57.880
Org SPS Instead of hard coding the Value 80 here it has to be an expression on that

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.400
expression.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.720
Should check the value off a cookie called team.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.640
If it is there,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.610
it should actually put that over here.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.030
Otherwise,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.540
that should give the default value a city.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.450
So let's replace this with a dollar curly bracket.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:16.100
Do not give any additional space before and after this expression inside that expression

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:16.750
explain.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.390
So here is where I'll say cookie,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.250
which is an implicit object.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:28.070
Darted team that is the cookie objects that this is the object representing this.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.770
See one here and that has name value and couple of other data.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.350
But we're interested in the value property off that.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.080
But if cookies or team is no,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.710
then we want to display 80 other ways.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.490
This is the loose.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.980
I'm gonna go at an expression here by taping Cookie Dart.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.410
Team equals two equals toe.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.640
No question mark.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.500
Then I have to take your 80.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.660
Otherwise,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.150
it's going to be whatever the value off that cookie,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.170
let's save this.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.490
Reload our application by running it again on the server.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.250
Let's click darkly,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:13.090
and I can see the team has changed on this is superhero.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.170
We have pulls on.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.380
We have united,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.080
Let's elect darkly and then Goto logging on.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.540
You can see that now the browser.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:29.490
Remember the user's choice on a place that team for all the other pages as well.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:37.120
So if I'm gonna log in with let's say we know we know dot co secret enter now you can see

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.250
I'm in the dashboard with the same team.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.900
View all contacts,

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.920
same team view details sent him.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.750
Every pitch contains the same team.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:53.630
Now you can also check by closing the browser as a less quitting Google chrome.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.370
That means there is no chrome running on my computer at this time.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.480
If I open chrome again on the visit,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.430
local host age radio,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.980
phone book,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.550
press enter,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.180
you can see that it's still remembers.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.560
My previous decision,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.390
which is darkly it was,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:17.310
selects superhero exit clothes from forever and then opened that again and then,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:23.050
with a local host age original phone book you can take remembers the superhero team as well

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.050
.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:29.540
You can also highlight the currently selector team in this case superhero by converting the

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.030
appearance off this Lincoln to a bottom so it stands out compared to the rest of them.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:39.390
And that can be done by dynamically adding a CSS plus toe each of these hyperlinks.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.060
So I'm gonna go and adhere.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.950
Class equals toe Bt in Bt and Dash link.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.970
That is going to be the default for each one of them.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.210
Someone copy this on,

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.750
then picks over here.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.290
But instead of hard coding link here,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.580
we can change this to primary dynamically based on the value of the cookie on that again

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.100
can be done using an expression.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:11.650
So I'm gonna go and use a dollar cookie dot team dot Value is it equals toe deity.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.450
Then we need to change this toe button.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.950
Otherwise it's gonna be linked.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.170
At this time.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.810
Our team is superhero.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.740
So obviously the condition here doesn't match because the cookie contained superhero

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.910
superhero Acoustical straight is false.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.260
It's going to be a link with the same expression I'm gonna copy on,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.730
then paste toe each one off them on,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.150
then make the necessary changes.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.230
And this is going to be darkly.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.800
The next one is the superhero here.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.160
It's going to be pulse.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.120
So let's change this year,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:53.150
Tito Pulse on one loss is this one which is going to be called United.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.140
I say this.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.790
Let's go and delete the cookie from our browser.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.600
So I'm gonna go to the view developer developer tools.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.380
I need to go to the application.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.710
There is cookies on you.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.980
Consider the cookie called Team on.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.180
Let me remove this and close the browser and reopened the same things.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.190
I'm gonna close it.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.220
Quit the browser,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:22.910
open crumb again and then with local state digital phone book.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.390
Because there is no cookie,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.780
you can see that none of the buttons are highlighted.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.250
Plus it comes back to the yeti by default.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.300
But if a click on darkly here,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.860
this is supposed to have been a primary but under T,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.240
what's the mistake on?

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.230
You can see that I've given the value,

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.900
whereas Button,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.550
it's all supposed to be primary.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:47.400
So I'm going to use a command F to search and replace button with primary.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.350
There are fire of them.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.230
Let's just click,

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.770
replace,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.550
find replaced point on.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.130
But I think it's done.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.090
Let's click on close Syria it,

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.330
and if I do a reload,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.100
you should now see that it's highlighted over here as darkly I still like superhero.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.990
That's the primary for the current team on Dhere is the pulse on here is united.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.290
Each one of them will show you it in a different way,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.560
but at least it's highlighting the current team.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.740
So this is a 80 would look like on darkly.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.300
So it is now.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.790
Our new feature for changing the team's dynamically has been completed,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.800
and our application is ready for deployment.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.520
So in the next lecture,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.310
let's create a production build,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.940
which is nothing with a wad file,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.490
that a couple of different mechanisms to do the same thing,

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.750
and after that we will deploy this onto a local time capsule work.
