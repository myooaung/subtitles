00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
in this lecture,

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.680
let's see how to start hitched to database server in the sorrow or more,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.630
as you can see that there is a hitch to dash Wonder for that 197 child file or here and the

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.100
location is clearly visible.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.640
It is under my home directory.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.600
They're the folder called dot m two.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.780
There is a repository slash com slash It's two database Andi.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.480
Eventually there is a folder called Hitch to Wonder for that 197 and inside that will be a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.990
child file.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.090
You can copy this qualified name by right click on this jar file and then say copy

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.210
qualified name on Windows.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.920
You can navigate to this folder double click that jar file,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
whereas on Mac as well as Lennox,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.250
you have tow run this job file as a job application.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.200
You can do the same thing even on Windows as well.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.900
But Windows provides a simple option that you can just double click the jar file,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.130
and it will run out a job application to run this as Joe Obligation on Mac as well as

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.760
Lennox,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.050
open a terminal and then type Java miners jar and then baste the location off the chart,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.790
so it's an absolute part,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.740
so you are able to run this from anywhere we want.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.280
I press enter and now we'll see that it will start the DB Server,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.570
which is a Java program,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.640
as well as it opened their client program in a browser.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.130
I'm gonna press,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610
enter and you'll see that it opens up local host,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.990
aged,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.370
relate to and by default it goes toe logging GSP where I have toe,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.090
specify the more in which he should run as well as the details for the team and by default

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.090
.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.490
If you're running it for the first time,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.450
you'll see generate gates toe embedded.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.860
But we want to run this in a standalone sorrow.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.240
Remorse someone select that drop down and then choose the generic H two server.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.980
So once you have selected the sorrow or more now the options here will change and the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.750
driver class name is our God hates to a driver.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.180
There is no need to make any change over there.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.760
The jelly bcu oral here is Jerry B.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.960
C.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.470
Colon,

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.220
Hitch to cool and TCP.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.910
So that's the client and server protocols on local host,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.820
which is the location off the server either.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.670
I p address.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.820
Our name also can be given if it's a different computer and then the location off a file

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.650
called Test to dot MBD Devi.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.500
In this case,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380
it's there in the home directory.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.580
That's where the tilde there.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.210
If I want to give a different BB name,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.640
I can change this toe.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.690
Something else.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.470
Let me give it us training Training dot Envied O.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.740
D.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.720
B does not exist in my home directory,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.870
so because of which,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.250
whatever the user name and password I'll be giving will be considered as the news element

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.730
password.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.420
So let me give this,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.590
as we note and password as a secret.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.980
Let's click on the test connection to see if things are OK and you see it is successful

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.070
Onda.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.440
Now,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.320
since it is successfully able to connect,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.750
I can click on the Connect and it'll take me to the USA,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.030
where I can work with SQL commands.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.630
If you want a distant click on this icon on,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.880
if you want to connect back,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.120
visit local host aged eight to or if you have clothes,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.140
this particular browser and you don't remember the actually oral you see on my top right

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.530
corner.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.340
Over here,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.450
there is an icon that says it's too database Will.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.560
There are few options opened H two consoles.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.860
Check the status exit the server.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.570
So I click on the H two consoler to come back on the brother again,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.170
and it remembers the previous options.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.590
So it's already filled in.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.010
I click on Connect,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.180
and I'm ableto gettinto my database,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.670
and what it has done is it has created a file called training dot imbudo db.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.880
So if I open a new finder window,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.430
you can see that under my home directly.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.610
There is a fine here called Training Dot Envied RTB.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.710
If you don't want this database anymore,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.640
or if you want to take a back up off this,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.550
you just have toe work with this particular file,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.840
and that's a binary file so you won't be able to see the content off that in a text editor

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.840
.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.620
So let's get it off that let's create a table in this particular database to work with in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.790
our tower project.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.370
So I'm gonna open a text editor called Visual Studio Court.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.010
You can use any text editor like notepad.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.050
Let's say we want to clear the table called customers.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.110
So we have to take create table customers and inside the bracket,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.060
going to define all the fields.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.510
The first field.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.000
I want to give it as I D,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.340
which is an integer.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.980
It's also supposed to be primary key.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.850
Let's also make this as an auto incriminated column,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.610
so I have to type your arto underscore increment.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.520
Let's add a name off the customer.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.220
It's gonna be a worker off.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.150
Let their 100.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.400
We can also say it's a mandatory column.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.950
We wanted a city worker off another 100.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.280
You can also type default and killed.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.760
The youth doesn't want to mention it's gonna be that bangle.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.940
Then we're gonna type your email worker off,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.950
say 2 55 4 number off worker to 55.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.610
You can also add additional constraints suggest this is supposed to be unique for number.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.950
It also supposed to be unique,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.940
so you don't want to add multiple customers with the same email or phone number.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.700
I believe for the sake of demonstration,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.200
this table is good enough.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.950
Let's copy this and then come down toe this section here and paste it.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.920
We could have time to directly over here,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.590
but I feel comfortable typing in a text editor.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.520
I click on the run button over here to see if I can run this command successfully and you

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.770
can see it has been successfully executed and there is a table customers created so I can

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.950
add a couple off records over here.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.850
Let's say Insert into customers.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.940
If you want to specify only few fields,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.830
that name email and phone is what I want to mention.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.750
So I take your name,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.190
email,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.770
phone,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.360
and then I type your values.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.810
I want to insert lit a tree records.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.850
I can open a bracket for one record here.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.840
So let's say I give my name.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.530
We know we know that we know dot Co on Let's say I give a phone number like this.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.200
All of them are stream types.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.720
Now.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.900
This is first regard,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.270
so I can now put a comma open another bracket for the second occur.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.650
Let's say this time I wanna type Sean.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.870
I'll take shown at example dot com some dummy number,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.000
and then one more I want to endure here.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.370
Let's say James James at example dot com another very,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.230
very generate number and cynical.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.510
So I'm gonna copy this Onda,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.350
replace this click on the run option again.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.990
And it says that update country.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.690
That means three records have been inserted.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.820
I'm gonna clear this click on customers over here automatically.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.200
A select style from customers.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.550
Come,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.510
I click on Run on.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.250
You can see that I'm ableto see the content off the table And sometimes you may have a big

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.550
SQL script file and you don't want to copy paste one commander that I'm are You don't even

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.060
want to copy and paste that in the text boats over here.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.110
You want to run that directly from the actual script file?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:41.430
So what you can do is I'm gonna save this as customers start SQL Oppress Command s on its

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.280
asking me where to say I'm gonna go to my desktop.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.930
That's my workspace.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.540
So I have this training works,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.850
pay them removed this and type customers dot SQL.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.420
I'll save it.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.700
And now I want to run all the commands in this SQL file.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.840
Now,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.710
to do that,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:07.340
I can go back to my X box over here and take the command run script from on then the

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.450
location off that particular file,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.950
which is under my home directory,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.960
I can use tilda slash on Windows.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.650
You may want to start with C Colon or Dickel and Slash and so on.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.050
Better copy that absolute part of that filing,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.840
then paste.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.560
In my case,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.050
it's under home directory.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.490
Under desktop.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:33.440
There is a folder called Training Dash Workspace and inside that I have no customers dot

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.650
SQL on.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.640
If I run this chord now I click on Run.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.950
You'll see that it comes with another saying that table customers already exists because

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.430
this is tryingto create new table called customer.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.890
But I already have this one,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.030
so it's a good idea to include a drop command.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.970
Also over here,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.130
you can say drop table customers if exists,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.040
so indicating if the table already exists,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.950
you drop that recreated and our new values.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.710
And just to ensure that the actual commanders successfully executor,

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.700
let me are one more record over here,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.940
I'm gonna add,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.620
say,

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.650
for example,

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.790
Rajesh Andi,

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:20.550
Rajesh at example dot com on Let's are one more number over here.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:26.830
Stay with it and run this command run script from so and so five electric the run button

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.860
again and this time there is no error because customers stable,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.650
get deleted and then get recreated.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.650
And then the records got inserted over here.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.310
Let me clear this and then click on customers and see what other content we have.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.580
So you can see that there are four records as inserted by our customers.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.340
