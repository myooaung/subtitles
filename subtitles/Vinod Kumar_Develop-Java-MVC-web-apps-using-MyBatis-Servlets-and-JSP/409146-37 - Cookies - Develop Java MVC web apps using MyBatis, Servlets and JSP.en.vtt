00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
in this lecture,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.040
let's discuss a boat cookies.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.370
A cooky is a piece of information that is created by the store application and sent to the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.020
client,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.660
which is not the middle browser.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.200
And the browser maintains the cookie,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
either within the browser session are it may even persist in the second the story.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.150
So even if you close the browser and open the brother again,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.880
the cookie,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.700
they're still alive.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.370
It depends on the way the cookie has been created and set on the starboard side to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.270
understand the same.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.800
Let's take an example.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.550
Let's begin by creating an HTML file under our Weber,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.250
so I'm gonna right click on the folder.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.330
Create a new It's Demel.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.810
Fine,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.050
let's call it US cookie demo dot It's human.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.230
That's enter.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.250
Let's change the title toe cookie demo.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.970
Give the same thing as hitch one also and then a horizontal rule up to that that assume

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.170
that we want toe.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.090
Pass a value from the browser to the celebrate so that the salad can take it and keep it as

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.690
a cookie.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.940
And later we will write another solar toe,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.750
access the cookies on display the same thing back.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.210
So let's add in HTML form some with their form.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.550
Action equals two.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.520
Let's call it a store cookie.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950
Method equals toe.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.980
Get that said that text.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.580
Enter name on a text box toe.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.620
Collect the name with the input type because toe text name equals toe Let their,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.680
for example data and then a submit button toe submit the data so the sunlit So we'll call

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.780
it us submit.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.310
So I'm clicking the submit button the value off the data along with the name goes toe this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.610
summit So we need to create a sublet that has this u R l pattern.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.600
So let's go door that package right click and say new class It's gonna does store cookie

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.130
several.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.420
It super class is gonna be http Sell it Click on finish that also are the an addition at

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.880
the rate Web summit on a Ural pattern off store dash cookie.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.940
So let's all start the default Feel worse.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.830
Annuity.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.390
Get it up.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.560
The comment already there do get matter from source menu over.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.630
They implement methods select.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.990
Do get click OK,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.350
and get it off these two lines.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.550
So since we are sending this for the glory data,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.680
we have to read it from the request objects so we can see here.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.130
String data equals toe request our get perimeter off data.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.690
And in case if data equals toe none,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.560
that means you haven't passed any data.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.800
Probably because you are accessing that some red directly.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.630
So I'm gonna redirect the user back to the cookie demo html and this can be done by typing

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.630
,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.250
rescued or send the redirect and then say you're dot slash cookie demo dot It's TML.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.850
Let's also as a return statement,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.350
because if it is no,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.020
we really don't have anything to do afterwards.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.900
So if data is not equal to no,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.820
let's store the data in the form of a cookie on the Sunday Be a pro.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.170
It's a class called Cookie,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.850
so I can say here cookie C one equals toe new cookie,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.230
but the constructor takes two parameters.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.280
One is the name off the cookie,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.240
and the second is the value off the cookie,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.000
Which is that the more data so the name is decided by you,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.840
so you can decide whatever the name of the cookie you want.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.570
You can add multiple cookies also,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.180
for example,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.780
I can say here that the name of the cookie is data.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.050
The value is this variable data.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.620
You can also decide how long the cookie is supposed to survive.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.330
For example,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.660
you may want a cookie to be available only in the browser session,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.240
which means if the browser is closed,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.670
you want the cookie to be destroyed so you can set the age of the cookie as minus one,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.790
which is the default.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.350
By the way,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.190
you can control the age of the cookie by calling C one dot set max age and then expiry in

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.070
seconds.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.290
So if you want a cookie to be alive for,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.640
let's say,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.790
one full year,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.650
you can say 365 days in tow.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.380
24 of us in tow,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.150
60 minutes in tow,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.120
60 seconds on this is all.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.400
You'll specify the expiry off the cookie now,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.950
since we have said the cookie age to be a positive value,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.460
this is called other persistent cookie.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.320
But if this is not set,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.140
or if you said this to minus one,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.370
it's called the Session Cookie Orebro Sufficient cookie,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.470
which means it's a lie only till the browser is alive.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.820
Now that we have created the cookie we need toe.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.270
Give it back to the point and anything that you want to give it back to.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.360
The plane is done.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.750
Why other response?

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.360
So you have your restaurant are on cookie and then see one note is the name of the function

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.380
is al cookie,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.240
because you can add multiple cookies now that I've added the cookie.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.150
Let's give a very basic or put to the user saying that the cookie has been stored and we'll

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.160
also include the cookie demo.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.560
It's female in our output to do so.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.060
First,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.280
we have toe set the content and the content type setting has to be done before you do

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.510
anything with the response.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.020
So let's do that in the beginning will say rescue dart set content type with their texture

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.460
slash.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.250
It's Yemen will also say out because toe rescue dot get writer We got the writer object,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.320
but let's declare out Toby off!

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.170
French writer,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.650
Let's full screen the editor on now I say here request Don't get request dispatcher dark

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.930
slash cookie demo h Tiemann dot include request on response.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.150
So in one line we can actually include the HTM and that we want to include,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.380
and now I'm gonna give a message out dot print Ellen may be ahead.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.320
Three will say Cookie store successfully slash hit three on,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.610
then out dark clothes.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.280
So this is where the user get the output back.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.780
So let's go and run the HTML.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.160
Let's say,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.580
while the file first run the html kokomo dot html by right click on that organized Ron

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.930
Sorrow.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.410
So we got the its chairman.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.850
Let's also go toe view developer,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.350
developer tools.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.300
Let's increase the weight off the same.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.450
Have a look at the network on Let's reload ones.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.550
When you reload,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.260
you can see you get the request that we thanked.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.450
When I click on that,

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.600
it shows me what are the request and response details.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.140
For example,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.960
if you want to see what other request hitters,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.510
you can click on the view source.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.760
You can see this is a first request line here,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.600
and then you have the bunch of headers on.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.850
There is no header called Cookie over here,

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.780
but let's send up name to the sunlit by typing and names.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.770
I'm gonna type your intern aim and they re not click on submit now,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.640
the second request has gone.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.910
Now the second request is store cookie question mark.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.790
Data equals two.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.930
We know and I got a method saying Cookie starts successfully,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.700
but if we click on this now,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.480
you can see that the response for this comes with a header called as set cookie.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.590
Data equals two.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.190
We know Max Age questions also expires equals toe Thursday 29 April 2021 which is exactly

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.560
one year from today.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.370
You can also go to the application top over here.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.120
You can see under cookies for the current you're in.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.030
You'll see that there is a key call data that is created which has a value off we note on

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.450
the rest of the details are available over here.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.830
Now,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.660
the best part is that you visit any part of this application.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.990
Now,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.590
for example,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.750
if I go to the index dotage chairman,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.360
which is nothing to do with this particular demo,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.400
you can still see that the request that is gone,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.960
which is for the index html carries the request header called Cookie.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.020
So you can see here that the header cookie carries data equals two.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.220
We know that the only cookie that I'm sending right now,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.470
but that is being sent so irrespective of rich sunlit or JC,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.350
that access the cookie will always be sent.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.080
So even if I close the browser,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.750
close all tabs,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:21.240
exit the browser completely and then open chrome again and then visit local host eijiro

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.900
eijiro.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.180
Let's open that.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.770
You can see that the cookie is still alive.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.540
For example,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.320
I can goto view developer developer tools under applications you can see for this.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.920
Ural,

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.060
the cookie data still exist.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.510
Let's close this in the cookie demo.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.200
HTML.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.950
Let's also provide a hyper ling tau view the cookie as well as remove the cookie.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.360
So let's go back to our eclipse.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.360
Right below this form.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.190
I'm gonna probably a hitter.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.450
F equals toe view cookies.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.880
This is because we may have multiple cookie,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.400
so let's also display all other cookies apart from the one that I have set.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.110
Let's give a caption off view cookies.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.760
We don't have a satellite corresponding to this.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.040
Let's create one by right click on the package.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.340
New class.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.430
Let's call it as view cookies.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.330
Sell it.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:16.430
Sell it The super close as http solid click finish.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.950
Let her the at Web summit.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:26.990
Whether you are in love view dash cookies at the default city in which annuity get it off

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.450
This different comment and then other do get like this.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.130
And in the do get,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.420
what we have to do is tow read on the cookies and then bring the same thing.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.510
So for printing,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.800
I need toe get the output stream.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.780
We also need to set the content type two html.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.370
So I'm gonna copy those two lines from the previous average.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.380
So I'm gonna copy these two lines and then based over here,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.780
we also want will probably include the HTML file.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.150
So that code is right here.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.340
So I'm gonna copy this and then come back here and then paste it.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.700
Now,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.550
since the cookies are coming from the client,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.180
anything that is coming from the client,

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.560
you have accessed Oh,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.550
in this object.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.250
But as when we wanted to send the cookies,

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.550
we had to add it to the response.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.700
So let's read all the cookies from the request object.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.610
And there is only one single function in the request object that can give you the cookies.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.650
It's called Request our Get Cookies,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.030
and that returns an array of cookies.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.430
Let's call it US cookies itself on.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:32.300
We need to create that variable repress command one or control one on Windows,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.530
and you can see what an array of cookies so you can always check if cookies is not equals.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:44.100
TUNEL as allies cookies dot lent is greater than zero.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.940
Then we want to provisional Put saying that these are the cookies that are phone.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.440
Let's get it over the cookies and let's give a message.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.060
You're out dot print Allen hit three.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:11:03.160
Here are the cookies slash hit three and then a for loop that is cookie C or C one.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.750
Whatever the variably want from cookies,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.310
we want to say,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.530
Oh,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:13.090
don't print Ellen That's other paragraph Cedar getting Andi.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.740
Let's also print the value off the same seed or get value and then slash p because we

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.660
started to the open paragraph.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:26.650
So let's say this right click on the Kokomo html runners run on Sarwar.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.660
We don't have to enter the name of the cookie because we are here already have store some

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:31.950
data,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.590
which is we know we can go and have a look at what are the cookies that are available by

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.460
clicking the view cookies.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.150
Andi.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.900
Sure enough,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.780
it should show data on.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.370
Do we know if you access any JSP in our application?

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.120
For example,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.140
we have your something called Hello?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:48.670
Jsp.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.750
So I'm gonna go here and then access.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.360
Hello?

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.530
Jsp directly press enter on,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.530
then come back Toe the cookie.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.020
The model,

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.850
It's demon.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.060
Now,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.720
if I access view cookies,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.590
you should see now that there is an additional cookie that is available which is called J

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.390
Session I D.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.170
And the session 80 on this is primarily because a jsp is by default.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:16.650
We cleared a session object on decision objects unique identify which is the session I d

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:23.240
will be sent back to the claim as a in memory session cookie which is called US J Session I

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.370
d.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.800
And that's why we are seeing this.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.550
So in case in a jsp,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.750
if you don't want the session object automatically being created,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.250
for example,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.430
in the hollowed or jsp since we're not dealing with a session,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.440
object or day,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.490
we can always go and say I don't want a session object here.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.800
Unnecessary creation of position,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:46.140
object and removal of that can be avoided by going to the JSP Fine on then in the page.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.590
Director.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.460
You can always say Session equals two falls.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.290
Save this now.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.800
If we're on this decision,

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.060
object will not be created.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.740
Other work since the session object has already been created.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.280
There's a cookie on that cookie in the browser cookie,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.290
which means as long as this browser is open,

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.280
this is always going to be alive.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.440
So let's close the room on,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:15.350
then open chrome gay and let's with it local host age radio suddenly the most slash cookie

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.060
demo Durex,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.550
Yemen.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.440
If I save you cookies,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.150
you can see that I don't see the J Section 80 if our access Hello Jsp.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.080
We started a little bit about the Hello Mrs though.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.850
But if I go back to the cookie demo dot html and then access the view cookies,

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:37.020
you can see that the session idea is not available because we said here that we don't want

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.340
session object to be created only when you access other James trees are our session.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.480
Didn't examples such as the add name starlet,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.780
then a new session off that gets created on then onwards decision.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.850
I will always be available as long as the browser is open.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.710
If you want to remove a cookie,

00:13:54.710 --> 00:14:00.000
all you have to do is to create another cookie with that and name and then said the age to

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.840
be zero and then write it back to the claimed to do that.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.510
Let's go on at another hyperlink over here.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.310
Let's put a brake on.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:14.360
Then type you're a hitter equals toe removed data cookie because we don't want to remove

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.250
all the cookies.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.230
Let's give a caption as removed.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.350
Data cookie.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.850
Say this.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.270
That's created some red.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.200
Corresponding to this.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.300
Let's copy this Goto Cordoba.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.360
No dark Web,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.240
right click New class.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.830
Let's call it as removed.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.940
Data cookie.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.860
Sorry it.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.550
And then super plus going to be a http.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.980
Suddenly,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.750
as usual,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:43.140
let's click on finish that's had an animation here at the rate Web summit and paste the

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.150
Ural pattern that also are the default cereal washing you already.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:52.660
I do get because we are associating this with the hyperlink.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.700
It's always going to be a get request,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.700
and all I have to do is to create a cookie corner,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.030
Data said.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.490
The age the value doesn't matter.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.410
Feel and send it back to the client with a max age of zero.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.590
So let's do that.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.620
Let's type your cookie.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.450
C equals toe New cookie off data on the value doesn't matter.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.920
Let's import the same and then with the seed,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.410
are set max each off zero at the cookie toe.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.100
The response by calling the respite or al cookie off the variable.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.600
See,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.460
And now I have to include the cookie,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.250
the more HTM in which I can do that by going to the previous example.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.030
Copy these three lines,

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.350
come back here and then baste it.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.320
It also given output saying that cookie has been deleted.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.260
Let's give a hit.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:39.770
Three.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.830
The cookie with name as data deleted.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.750
That's a slash H three on about dot Close.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:55.550
Let's say this right click on the cookie dough more extreme in on and run as Ron Answer one

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.550
.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.950
So let's give a different name this time.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:04.260
Let's say here I'm gonna give Kemar click on submit so it says cookie store view Cookie.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.150
You can say it says data is Kumar.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.350
I click on the move data cookie.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.160
It comes back and say cookie data has been deleted.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.470
I can go and check the cookies,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.700
and you can see there is no cookies as well.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:22.890
If I go to the view developer developer tools in the application top under cookies,

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.530
you can see that for this euro.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.340
There is no pookie over here the most of the time.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.330
We a wide using cookies because whatever that we store in the cookies,

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.950
we can as well store on the service using HTT position.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:40.580
But the only thing is that the Xdd position itself uses co case toe maintain the session i

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:40.900
d.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.760
So that's all for this lecture seeing the next one.
