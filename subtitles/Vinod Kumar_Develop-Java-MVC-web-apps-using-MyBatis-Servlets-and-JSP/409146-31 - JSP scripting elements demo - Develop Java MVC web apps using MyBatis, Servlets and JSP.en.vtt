00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
in this literal let's understand the use off scripting elements in JSP For this,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.490
let's create a JSP that can read the date off from this database table on display the same

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.180
in its TML format.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.530
So the first thing is,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.740
we have toe add the relevant Josh in our bomb,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.310
the XML.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.140
So we need the hits.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.740
Two jobs.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.050
I'm gonna open the palm.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:31.800
The XML are a dependencies section on inside that I want toe the hitch to dependency.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.690
So the extra dependency I can get there from envy and Repository Or May 1 Central look for

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.380
heads to the 1st 1 But we're gonna take the one dot for that 1 97 Washington.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.850
I'm gonna copy that.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.900
Come back toe Palmdale Examine based it.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
Save it.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.620
We also have toe removed the scope are we have to say,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.760
Scopus privilege on Let's close the palm They're excellent.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.590
So we have our dependence is really Let's create a jsp called customer list dot jsp I'm

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.070
gonna right click on the back.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
New jsp fine.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:20.620
Al Qaeda's customer list dark GSP press enter changed the title dough customer list also at

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.040
a similar which one and probably hitch are.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.450
Let's also add a paragraph power by JSP.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.390
And this way we wanted this for the list of customers in an HTML table format.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.480
Let's add a table.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.060
Probably border equals toe one.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.040
And then we say you're there is a T head,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.700
which is the table heading may consist off one role with maybe four or five columns with

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.430
the hatch.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.630
Let's give it us,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.180
I d.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.490
Then we will add a T hitch for name another one for city,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.760
Another one for email on day,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.820
one more for four number after the D head,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.740
we're gonna add a D body and the tea body is where we want a row for every role in this

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.600
particular table.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.980
So I have four rows here.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.670
I need four tr's over here,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.460
but the fourty years we want here should be dynamically created.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.490
Using a loop on the loop should loop over a Java results set.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.130
And that's where we have to know work with Jerry B.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.430
C.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.310
I'm not gonna work with my back is here.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.760
I'm gonna work with very busy.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.060
So its full screen this the first and foremost thing is that we have toe open a connection

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.060
.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.950
When this page is loaded and when this page is unloaded,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.950
we want the connection to be closed.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.290
So if I want to open a connection only ones,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.450
it has to be done using a jsp innit lifecycle function on the J.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.850
Spin it like Second function can be added using a declaration block.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.500
So let's go toe probably the beginning section over here.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.760
It can be done anywhere.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.550
It doesn't matter.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.480
The declaration block is like script late,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.490
but with an exclamation symbol.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.340
Now this part can be used for creating a member variable for the class are member function

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.620
so,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.750
like second functions become member functions?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.050
You can use this for static variables are.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.160
If you want to create inner classes,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.750
you can use that so you can't use implicit objects over here like out or requests because

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.000
out request and other implicit objects are part of the service function and this is outside

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.960
of the service function.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.600
So let's read the JCB innit?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.350
Public wide jsp in it.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.450
There is no argument for this particular function,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.860
and one more function public wide jsp destroy.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.440
Now these two functions need to have access to the same variable connection.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.160
So I'm gonna declare a member variable connection corn and not initialized.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.460
Now you can see that the connection has to be imported.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.360
So this is going to be a little tricky one,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.000
because I can trade the import statement inside this because this is a declaration block

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.470
and the court here becomes part of your job class and inside the class,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.350
you country the import statement.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.270
So the import statement have to be outside of the class.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.910
And that's why we can't really do an import here.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.410
Now.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.550
The way you can do is you can use the page directive toe,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.930
add the necessary import.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.570
Now,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.140
one thing you can't do here is pride pressing command shift pole or control shift.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.650
Or you can organise imports.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.790
You cannot move the court set and say,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.250
Hey,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.390
import that here.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.510
That is also not possible.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.410
But one thing you can do is you can go to the end of this and then press control space.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.570
And then it says,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.170
import from Java terrestrial packet.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.460
Samuel press enter and you can see that it has added a new page director with import equals

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.280
toe job order.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.130
Let's kill that connection on that connection needs to be initialized over here.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.120
For this,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.970
I'm going to say class start for me.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.060
On the name of the driver is our dart.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.940
It stood out.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.630
Driver,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.240
That's the driver Class name Destro's a checked exception and you can see the intelligence

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.880
doesn't help.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.010
Your you may not be ableto through an exception from here because it is a standard function

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.010
.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.780
You can't do that.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.750
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut this and put a try catch block manually and then

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.650
based inside that I'm not gonna handle that exception because there is nothing to be done

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.160
over here.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.840
If the class not formed exception,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.690
he's thrown.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.700
But for the timing,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.600
I'm gonna say your e x dot prints actress,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.850
but this will be printed on the job or console,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.350
not on the browser.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.690
So I'm gonna save this.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.790
So let's go here and then do the initialization off con,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.290
which is nothing but gone equals toe driver,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.060
manager,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.510
press controlled space and then say driver manager needs to be imported from Java,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.950
a skill that's a separate page directive.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.230
Then they get connection and I need to supply your user name and password.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.520
So let's do the same thing.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.850
I'm gonna create your string.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.400
Your URL equals toe the euro That is required to panic toe extra database,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.800
which is Jerry B.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.200
C.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.800
Colon each to Poland.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.980
TCP colon double slash local host slash tilde slash training on.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.320
That's the name off the TV there 1/2 and then string user equals toe.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.890
We note Andi string password equals toe secret.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:47.080
Now we have opened the connection and we can close the same thing when this particular JSP

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.250
is being destroyed One second I require a try catch block.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.110
I'm gonna copy this whole stuff and then based here on,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.610
then all I'm gonna do is to say,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.570
conduct close because conduct close throws a checked exception.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.650
We have to handle that.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.400
So if I run this for the time being,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.290
even though it doesn't produce an output,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.040
it opens up its TML content in a browser.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.380
But I'm more interested in the result in job off files.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.020
If I go back over here,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:20.280
you can see that there is a customer underscore 00 to destroy underscored jsp Java.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.250
So the name is totally automatically generated so we don't have to worry about the name

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:30.050
someone rightly open with visual studio core on this time you can see right inside the

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.510
class.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.970
I have got my variable connection JCB in it and jsp that strike.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.330
But if I remove the exclamation mark from here,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.820
save this and then refresh this.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.620
I do get an error over here,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.570
and that's primarily because you see that inside the class,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.950
the variables don't exist.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.160
But if I scroll down over here inside the justice of dysfunction,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.940
you can see that it has created a variable.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.630
That's fine.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.560
That's not a problem.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.520
But you can't read a function inside a function.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.330
So that's the reason why we're getting another.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.150
So we go back and do this.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.970
Save this now there is no editor.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.190
Of course I can refresh that on.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.650
I got some output.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.460
So we have opened the connection,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:12.940
Onda.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.590
At the end,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.080
that connection gets closed.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.750
But this is where I need toe actually use the connection,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.240
create a prepared statement,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.260
execute the query and then handled it results it.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.580
So to do so.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.340
Let's come here.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.250
And at a script lit on,

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.280
I'm using a script lit here because this is where I want to make use of the out dot

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.450
parental and statements on out of an implicit object.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.150
I have access toe implicit objects only instead of scrip lit,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:46.330
let's go and declare that statement in the form off prepared statement that also put a try

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:55.170
catch block over here on the catch block is simply going to say exception E x andi extort

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.110
brimmed stack trees,

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.100
nothing else.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.540
On inside the try block.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.850
I'm gonna create the prepared a statement.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:12.690
It's the empty equals toe conduct repair statement off Select star from customers.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.760
Let's put a semicolon prepared statement needs to be imported.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.850
I'm gonna press control space at the end.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.250
You can see that it's imported over here.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.360
Let's save this.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:29.520
And now we need to create the results that I'm gonna say result Set control Space artists

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.200
equals toe s tempted our execute quietly.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.020
So I executive the skill statement right here on.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.650
Let's take while orders dot next,

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.140
so looping over the result set.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:49.700
This is where I need to print tr now instead of using out dot print Ellen toe print that tr

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.320
slash tr td slash tv and all those things What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna terminate this.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.820
Cripple it by closing the script legs that this part is closed over here on.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:06.060
Then the rest of the section I'm gonna open using another script lit here so you can see

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.020
completes cripple.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.940
It is now divided into two parts.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.650
So this part is Java.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.030
This part is Java.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.580
But this part here is an extreme election.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.920
So I can straight and I'll say tr slash tr just like the one that made it over here on

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:29.320
inside the tr I'm gonna have five td slash TV statements like this on the TV is supposed to

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.810
display the data from the results it so our as they get into off one or I d.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.980
So instead of printing using out dot print Ellen,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.150
we're gonna prefer to use expressions.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.630
I'm gonna say person which equals toe orders.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.080
Don't get into off either one.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.500
If I'm sure about the column position,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.100
otherwise I can say i d.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.780
And for the 2nd 1 big unused percentage equals toe order,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.240
start,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.450
get string off name and the same thing.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.720
I'm gonna copy and paste for the remaining ones.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.610
But changing the respective column names There's gonna be a city.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.220
This is going to be email on.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.870
The last one is going to be phone Solar JSP is ready.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.520
Let's go back to the browser,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.890
refresh the page and you can see that we got the output on the browser.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.770
Let's go back to eclipse.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.650
This is an expression.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:28.260
This is a sharp form for out dot print off the whole thing that we're given.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.520
If I go back to the court here,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.600
the gender did one.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.780
If you scroll down,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.840
you can see that wherever there is a TV,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.490
it is all dirt print.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.360
Others start getting so this is what we give inside the expression.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.700
But that's been converted into a series off out dark print statements Soto summarize we

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.220
have here Page directive,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:55.120
which follows us Toe do import Import is the only AK tribute in the page directive that can

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.450
be repeatedly used.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.260
All others are used only one time.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.690
The declaration block begin to the less than percentage exclamation the Cody,

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.800
right inside a declaration block are either member.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.660
Variables are member functions.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.440
Static gluts are nested classes.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.220
Similarly,

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.640
if you come down over here,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.480
there is a script lit that's cripple.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.450
It is nothing but a piece of Java accord that will be kept as it is in the resulting Java

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.260
source score.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.290
This is an expression which is an equal in,

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.080
or a shark phone for our doctrine statements.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.070
That's all in this lecture.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.290
Stay in the next one.
