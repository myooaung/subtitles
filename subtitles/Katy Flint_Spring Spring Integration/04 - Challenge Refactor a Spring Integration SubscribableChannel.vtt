(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.001
- [Instructor] For this code challenge,

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.000
use your knowledge of channel implementation types

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.006
to refactor the direct-channel instance

5
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.008
that we built in an earlier lesson

6
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:18.000
into a published subscribed channel instance.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.006
This way we can consume the same channel broadcast messages

8
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.004
by two different subscribers.

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.002
Let's look at the challenge specs

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.002
and implementation hints in the source code.

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.002
After updating your file view to this current lesson

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:36.006
by using get checkout 02_04b,

13
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.002
you will see a Read Me file

14
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.000
that lays out the parameters of this challenge.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.002
In the root of your repository,

16
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:49.004
you will see a file called Code Challenge 02_04.MD.

17
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.006
There you will find instructions for what we're doing,

18
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.009
naming the files that should be changed,

19
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.000
the line numbers where the hints and instructions are at,

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and what you can do to see if you've been successful.

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.006
So good luck with this challenge.

22
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.000
I will see you in the next video

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
with my suggestions for one way to solve this.
