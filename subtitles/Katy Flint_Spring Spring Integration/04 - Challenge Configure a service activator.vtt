00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.006
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.006
- [Instructor] For this challenge,

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.000
use your general knowledge

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of Spring Integration message flow configuration

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.001
to add a service activation component

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.009
to our existing message flow.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.007
This will add a significant business function

8
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:17.009
to our application

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.000
with very little development effort required.

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.006
Let's look at the challenge specs and implementation hints

11
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.000
in the source code.

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.006
Initialize your project files

13
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:31.009
by typing git checkout 03_04b.

14
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.007
Then at the root of your repository,

15
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.002
you will be able to see a file called

16
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.006
code challenge 03_04 nd.

17
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.009
The basic instructions for the challenger supplied there.

18
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.000
There is only one file that you need to modify

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.008
for this challenge,

20
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:49.003
and that is status-monitor.xml

21
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.005
In line 24 of that file you will see some hints

22
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.004
about how to go about doing this work.

23
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.000
So good luck and have fun.
