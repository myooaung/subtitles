00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] The exercise files for this course

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.001
are stored on GitHub.

3
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.001
There are branches for both the start and end states

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.004
of each video where we work on code.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.006
You can view a list of all the branches here

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.002
in GitHub from the branch dropdown.

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.006
For example, if you want to browse the start state

8
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:22.000
for video 02_01, Create a Message, you can change

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.003
to the 02_01b branch here where B stands for begin.

10
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.001
The ending state of the Create a Message video

11
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.000
is in the 02-01e branch.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.001
The main branch of the repository

13
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.008
holds the completed project code.

14
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.009
This project is runnable on any branch.

15
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.006
The root repository may be forked at will,

16
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:49.004
allowing you to experiment, practice, and commit any portion

17
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.004
of these lessons as you wish.

18
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.004
The lessons are presented from a fork

19
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.005
of the root repository and you can make your own fork

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.007
through the GitHub user interface.

21
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.006
To work with this Java project, there are multiple

22
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.005
integrated development environments that you can choose.

23
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.009
By cloning or downloading the project files

24
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.001
at your command line, you will be prepared

25
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:14.005
to open the project in any IDE that you wish.

26
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:18.000
Your IDE likely has a specific way to clone a git repository

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.002
from within the user interface

28
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.008
and this will vary by environment and also by your preferred

29
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:26.003
GitHub authentication mechanism.

30
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:31.003
You can also run a clone from the command line.

31
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.001
Once you have the project files on your local

32
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.002
development system, you can proceed to open, compile,

33
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:40.004
and run the Maven-based Spring Boot project in your IDE.

34
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:45.000
Again, these exact steps will vary depending on your IDE.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.009
The readme file in the root directory

36
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.004
of the GitHub repository gives instructions

37
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.005
for procedures in IntelliJ.

38
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.000
To navigate between video exercise files

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.006
in your local system, use the Git Checkout command

40
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.006
either in your command line terminal

41
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.003
or in your IDE command line.

42
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.009
For example, using the IntelliJ command line prompt

43
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.003
to switch your view to the project files

44
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.009
for the start of video 02_01, Create a Message,

45
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.000
looks like this, git checkout 02_01b.
