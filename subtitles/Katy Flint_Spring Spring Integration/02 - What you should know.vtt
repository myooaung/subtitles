00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Tutor] This course is a foundational course

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.006
in Spring Integration.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.001
To get the most out of this course

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.003
you will need a fluency with Java 8

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.002
and the Core Spring Framework

6
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:14.003
including XML-based dependency injection configuration.

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.004
In order to interact

8
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.002
with the hands-on project exercise files

9
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.007
you will need to be able to interact

10
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:23.002
with a Git repository, cloning and checking out branches

11
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.002
are the important skills here.

12
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.000
Also required are the abilities to compile

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.003
and run a maven-based spring application

14
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:34.007
in a Java friendly, integrated development environment,

15
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.006
such as IntelliJ, NetBeans, or Eclipse.

16
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.006
We will present our code demonstrations using IntelliJ.

17
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.009
However, you can have success

18
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.006
with any major Java-based IDE.

19
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.006
Familiarity with object-oriented design principles

20
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.002
and patterns are required in order to get the most

21
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.000
from the theoretical portions of the course.
