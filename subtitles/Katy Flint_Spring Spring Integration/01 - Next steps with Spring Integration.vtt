00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] As you go forward

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:03.003
with your work in Spring Integration,

3
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.005
here are some extremely valuable resources

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.005
that I would like to recommend.

5
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.000
These resources have been invaluable in my own learning

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.008
and sit at the center of my personal library.

7
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.001
LinkedIn Learning provides outstanding resources

8
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.007
for expanding your Spring expertise.

9
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.009
If you are thinking of using Spring Integration

10
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.006
as a component of robust web applications,

11
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.008
I highly recommend the courses on Spring MVC

12
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.003
and Spring real-time web apps.

13
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.002
If backend processing is your interest,

14
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.004
I recommend the course on Spring Batch

15
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.000
as a natural, next-step topic.

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.003
The Spring Integration API documentation

17
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.009
itself is outstanding,

18
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.007
easy to navigate by package and class name.

19
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.001
Not only will you find concrete implementation details here,

20
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.003
but you can also discern important foundational

21
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.002
pattern relationships throughout the framework.

22
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.004
The Spring team also provides a rich library

23
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.008
of working code samples hosted at GitHub

24
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.006
that you can freely download and experiment with.

25
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.006
I recommend that you become familiar if you are not yet

26
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.009
with the publication we have referred to repeatedly

27
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.002
in this course.

28
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.004
"Enterprise Integration Patterns:

29
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:10.000
Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions"

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.001
is published by Addison-Wesley and authored by luminaries

31
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.002
in the software design field.

32
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.001
And finally, a very practical book,

33
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.005
called "Spring Integration in Action,"

34
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.007
published by Manning Publication,

35
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.008
holds a wealth of theoretical information

36
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.005
that will be of particular use

37
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.004
to those in architectural roles.

38
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.005
Thanks for joining me in this course.

39
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.004
I wish good luck and good skill to you and your team

40
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.004
as you pursue Spring Integration in your projects

41
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:38.000
and in your coding career.
