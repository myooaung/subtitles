(gentle music)

2
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.004
- [Instructor] Let us complete our code challenge together.

3
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.001
The challenges you recall is to add a service activator

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.004
to the message flow,

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.000
so that our status monitoring channel will automatically

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.009
cause a customer account credit to be applied.

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.003
This way the account credit functionality can be achieved

8
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.000
as a by-product of the existing message flow

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.007
without a manual invocation of the service

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.005
inside our business logic.

11
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:28.009
In order to achieve this,

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.007
what we need to do is add service activation configuration

13
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.001
to our status monitor message flow.

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.005
And that will look like this.

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.003
Leveraging the integration namespace,

16
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.006
we want a service activator element.

17
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:47.004
Our input channel shall be our status monitor channel.

18
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.004
When something comes through this channel,

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.008
we're trying to activate.

20
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.004
The bean that we activate here that we're referencing

21
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:59.008
is identified in line 33 as account credit service.

22
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:04.001
And the method that we want to call inside that bean

23
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:12.008
is named credit customer account.

24
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:14.003
That is all that we need to do

25
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:16.006
in order to configure our service activator.

26
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:21.003
Let us see if our tests run at this point.

27
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:23.003
And our JUnit test is successful,

28
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.003
so we have successfully

29
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.000
completed the challenge, congratulations.
