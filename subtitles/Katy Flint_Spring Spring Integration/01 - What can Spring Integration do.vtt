00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Kathy] Message-based system design

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.001
dominates the enterprise application landscape.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.008
Also, the Spring framework is in use

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:13.000
with approximately one half of all enterprise Java projects.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.005
What do you get when you put these two

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.006
heavy hitters together?

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.001
You get Spring Integration.

8
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.008
Spring Integration extends the Spring framework

9
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.004
to support the well-known enterprise integration patterns,

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.009
in order to enable lightweight messaging

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.009
within Spring-based applications.

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.003
A message-based approach to design

13
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.002
holds benefit at many different scales.

14
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.005
From local, domain-centric business processing

15
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.002
within the bounds of a single Java virtual machine runtime,

16
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.006
all the way to highly decentralized

17
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.001
multisystem integrations.

18
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.007
Spring Integration, with its gorgeous library

19
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.009
of out-of-box implementations

20
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.000
that adhere to deep, theoretical underpinnings

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.004
has answers for this entire range of use cases.

22
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.007
It allows a Java application of any scale

23
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.002
to adopt a single, robust messaging framework

24
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.001
that maintains a separation of concerns.

25
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.000
And that is essential for producing efficient,

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.009
maintainable, testable code.

27
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.002
I am Kathy Flint, and I've been building software

28
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.005
professionally for 25 years, and working with Spring

29
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:23.007
in enterprise settings since 2005.

30
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.005
Please join my LinkedIn Learning course

31
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.002
to explore the impressive range of capabilities

32
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.003
that Spring Integration offers.

33
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:32.008
Together, we will build a learning application

34
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.009
that simulates a consumer power grid dashboard

35
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.000
for a fictional green energy company, called Conetico.

36
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.009
We will integrate JVM-centric components,

37
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.007
as well as external systems, keeping an eye

38
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:48.004
on both theoretical and technical aspects

39
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.002
of what we are doing.

40
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:51.009
By the end, I believe that you will have

41
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.001
a solid grounding in Spring Integration

42
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.001
and be equipped to start using this powerful platform

43
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.000
for your own purposes.
