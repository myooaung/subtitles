00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.130
The very last thing we need to do is to head over to our Firebase dashboard and under the database tab,
1

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.850
remember that when we first set up our cloud Firestore, we set some rules that pretty much allowed anybody
2

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.580
to read and write into our database.
3

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.070
Now as Firebase warns you
4

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.990
it says that your security rules are pretty lax basically.
5

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.710
And if you click on learn more, it actually takes you to the documentation page on how to define cloud
6

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.420
Firestore
7

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.970
security rules. And you can look through this documentation to see what kind of level of security you
8

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.110
want for your documentation.
9

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.680
So for example you could have a database where nobody can read and write under any condition.
10

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.470
Well that's not going to be very useful for us.
11

12
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.420
And at the moment what we have is pretty much allowing anybody to write and read to our database which
12

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.740
is a bit too insecure.
13

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.330
So what we're going to choose is make sure that only authorized users or users who are logged in and
14

15
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.410
registered can actually access all our documents and read and write their messages to the database.
15

16
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.910
So to change it over, we're going to go ahead and copy all of this code and we're going to replace our
16

17
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.030
current lax rules with the new rules.
17

18
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.270
So we're going to select everything in here and delete it and then we're going to replace it with what
18

19
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.170
we copied over.
19

20
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.220
So this allows read and write access only if they have a user ID, namely they are already authenticated
20

21
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.950
and we can see them as one of our users.
21

22
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.600
And once you're ready, go ahead and click publish to make these rules go live and you'll see that our
22

23
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.280
warnings et cetera go away.
23

24
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.440
Now to test it, there's even a really handy simulator.
24

25
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.720
So for example you can say that I'm going to try and get some data out of my cloud Firestore. And we
25

26
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.180
can define a path to our documents under documents/messages. And we can check that if this request
26

27
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.110
is coming from somebody who's not authenticated trying to access our messages collection what happens.
27

28
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.520
And you can see that it tells us fails right? It doesn't let us read from our database and if we change
28

29
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.570
that to maybe say create, which is basically a write request, you can see it also gets blocked. Unless
29

30
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.580
we check the authenticated marker and we go ahead and add one of those e-mails that we'd already authenticated
30

31
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.280
and registered as one of our users,
31

32
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.780
and now if I click run, then you'll see that read is now allowed and so will write as well. So now that
32

33
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.230
our rules are live for our database then we don't have to worry about some randos accessing it.
33

34
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.040
And with that we've now completed our Flash chat app. So that's it.
34

35
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.300
That's all for the Flash chat app.
35

36
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.340
And I hope you had fun making this app and I hope you'll be building your own apps using Firebase cloud
36

37
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.890
Firestore and authentication.
37

38
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.490
There's so much more that you can explore. So take advantage of the documentation and what you learn
38

39
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.640
in this module.
39

40
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.450
I look forward to seeing all of your amazing creations on Twitter under the hashtag #FlutterBrew.
