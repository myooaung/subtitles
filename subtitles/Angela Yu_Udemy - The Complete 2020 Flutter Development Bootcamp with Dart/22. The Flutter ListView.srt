00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:08,340
Now in the last lesson we used a stream builder widget to be able to update our Flutter app with the
1

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,640
messages that get sent and any new messages that come through. In this lesson, we're going to focus on
2

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,530
improving the styling and user experience of our chat app.
3

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,150
What does this involve?
4

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,260
Well let me show you what we're aiming for first.
5

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,270
Here's how our app will look
6

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,790
by the end of this lesson.
7

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,760
As you can see the individual chat messages are nicely separated out in these beautiful blue bubbles.
8

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,520
But that's not all.
9

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,040
We'll actually be able to scroll through our chat messages and also when we write a new message and press
10

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,300
the send button,
11

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,850
our text field will be cleared.
12

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,440
Now let's see where we are right now.
13

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,100
What do you think will happen for instance when we have too many messages to fit into the space on our
14

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,650
screen?
15

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,820
I want to show you firstly what happens if we have too many messages and instead of creating 20 more
16

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,860
messages, I'm simply just going to change the styling of our text widget.
17

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,080
So I'm going to add a style property and inside this text style, I'm going to change the font size from
18

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,060
what it currently is, which is probably about 14 pixels, to let's say 50.
19

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,570
Let's make it a lot bigger and see what happens.
20

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,150
Now if we take a look at our app, you'll see that each of the text widgets are going to become gigantic.
21

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,460
And because we have lots of messages, they're now flowing off the screen.
22

23
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,760
And even if I drop the keyboard you can see it's still going off the screen and it's so large in fact
23

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,700
that it's pushed the send button and also the text field off the screen entirely.
24

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,970
Now this is not what we want because we can't have a chat app that only allows you to receive like five
25

26
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,780
messages
26

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,590
right?
27

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,920
So let's change this.
28

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,400
What we would want instead is something that scrolls so that we can have infinite, almost infinite amounts
29

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,520
of data inside our chat screen and we only need to see one part at a time.
30

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,990
So we scroll through it to see older messages.
31

32
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:24,010
Now in order to do this in Flutter, we have something called a ListView. And it's remarkably simple to
32

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,190
use especially when you consider the alternatives of how much effort it takes to set up a list view
33

34
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,900
on Android or a table view in iOS.
34

35
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,760
Let me show you all that we need to do. At the moment,
35

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,660
our Stream builder is returning a column with children which is a list of text widgets.
36

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,360
Now we're going to keep the text widgets as it is but instead of using a column widget, we're going to
37

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,240
change it to a ListView widget.
38

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:03,600
And because we also have our container inside the same column which contains our send button and also
39

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,150
our text field,
40

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,820
we're going to wrap the list view inside an expanded widget. This way it won't try to take over the whole
41

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,160
screen and only take up as much space as is available.
42

43
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:25,410
So now if we hit save and we take a look at the app, you can see that we now have our messages in a scroll-
43

44
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,410
able listview and we can scroll it to the top and the bottom.
44

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,780
And we've also got our text field and send button here.
45

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,640
So now if I raise the virtual keyboard, you'll see that my list view is still there in the background,
46

47
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,500
it doesn't really change and we can still scroll through it but my text view now pops up and down pending
47

48
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,810
on the size of the keyboard.
48

49
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,780
So now that we've implemented the scroll behavior, it's time to start styling our chat screen to make
49

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,870
it look more like a real chat app.
50

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,690
This is another good opportunity to see Flutter's hot reload in action and how it can really help with
51

52
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,400
our workflow.
52

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,700
Now the first thing I want to do is I'm going to add some padding to my list view.
53

54
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,900
So let's add a bit of padding and it's going to be edgeInsets.symmetric.
54

55
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,510
And I'm going to add about 10 onto the horizontal and maybe 20 onto the vertical.
55

56
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,250
So let's hit save and we'll see it being pushed down a little bit from the top
56

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,700
and also a little bit in from the left and the right. And the next thing we're gonna do is we're going
57

58
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,070
to improve the way that our messages look
58

59
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,100
because at the moment it looks terrible.
59

60
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,250
So instead of just using a bog standard text widget, let's build something custom.
60

61
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,340
So I'm gonna go right down to the bottom and I'm going to build a new stateless widget. And I'm going
61

62
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,160
to call it a MessageBubble.
62

63
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:05,120
And this MessageBubble is instead of going to return the container, it's instead going to contain a
63

64
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,260
text widget and also quite a lot of other things.
64

65
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,400
So I'm going to cut that from over here and I'm going to paste it inside here.
65

66
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,360
Now that I've transplanted the text widget over here,
66

67
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,860
I need a way of being able to provide those things:
67

68
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,600
the message text and the message sender.
68

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,250
So I'm gonna create a final string variable which I'll call the sender and also a final string variable
69

70
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,470
which I'll call the text.
70

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,310
And now when the message bubbles get constructed, we'll be able to initialize these values,
71

72
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,320
the sender and the text.
72

73
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,240
So instead of having the message text, it's now just code text and instead of having the message sender,
73

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,740
it's now called sender.
74

75
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,260
So inside our build method, instead of returning just a bog standard text widget, we're going to wrap
75

76
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:10,850
it inside a material widget. Because when we have a material widget we can specify maybe some background
76

77
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,630
colors.
77

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,990
So let's change that to a maybe light blue accent. So I want to take a look at what it looks like while
78

79
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm designing.
79

80
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,850
So let's go up and fix our code over here so that we can actually use it.
80

81
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,820
So previously, we had the final message widget being equal to a text widget but now it's going to be
81

82
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:42,070
created from a message bubble. And we're going to be passing in the sender as the messageSender and
82

83
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,430
the text as the messageText.
83

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,840
And while we're here and we're changing the names of things to message bubbles, let's go ahead and change
84

85
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,340
these variable names as well.
85

86
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,080
So I'm gonna change all the places where it's called messageWidget.
86

87
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,540
I'm going to go to refactor and rename and instead of calling it just a bog standard widget, it's going
87

88
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:18,620
to be a messageBubble. Refactor that and then over here where we have our message widgets instead of
88

89
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,230
being called a messageWidget,
89

90
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm going to refactor it and call it a list of message bubbles and we're getting an error here because
90

91
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,160
we've specified previously that message bubbles are a data type of a list of text widgets and it's now
91

92
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,810
no longer text widgets.
92

93
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,240
It's in fact some messageBubble widgets.
93

94
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,630
So now that we've fixed all the code around here, we're ready to hit save and see what our message bubbles
94

95
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,550
look like
95

96
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,100
as it stands. And as it stands, it still doesn't look great.
96

97
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,270
It's got a blue background but each of the messages are blurring into other ones.
97

98
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:08,420
So let's go ahead and add a little bit of padding to separate them out. Around our material widget, I'm
98

99
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:16,450
going to add a padding widget and we can delete the content which initialize is a object as of Dart 2.0.
99

100
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,920
So we have an edgeInsets all so let's add maybe let's say 10 pixels of padding around each of our
100

101
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,400
message bubbles.
101

102
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:33,950
Also now at least we can see them kind of separate from each other which is nice but it still doesn't
102

103
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,520
look great.
103

104
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,650
So what's the biggest eyesore?
104

105
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,110
Well it's the fact that our text is 50 points
105

106
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:46,890
large. Let's fix that and let's change this to a more normal 15 pixel font.
106

107
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,110
And I'm also going to change the color while I'm here
107

108
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,950
to colors.white.
108

109
00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:00,830
So let's hit save and and it looks still pretty strange. Now at the moment,
109

110
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:07,910
our problem is that the material that's around our text is far too close to the text.
110

111
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,540
So let's give our text a little bit of padding away from the material.
111

112
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,860
Let's wrap this inside some padding as well.
112

113
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:22,940
And we're going to set it to maybe let's choose a little bit of a symmetric padding and we'll set the
113

114
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,820
vertical to 10 pixels and the horizontal to maybe 20.
114

115
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:35,090
So just a little bit more padding around the horizontal than the vertical and we're starting to look
115

116
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,010
like messages right? It's starting to look a bit better than before.
116

117
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,220
Now one of the things that you can add to a material that you've seen in raised buttons or the floating
117

118
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,890
action buttons is an elevation.
118

119
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:56,060
So let's add a little bit of drop shadow to each of our messages by adding maybe 5 pixels of elevation.
119

120
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,720
And it starts looking like it's a real bubble now but it wouldn't be a bubble unless it was circular,
120

121
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,220
unless it was round.
121

122
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,990
So how can we turn this square into a round object?
122

123
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,770
Well we can tap into the border radius property.
123

124
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:21,140
We can set the border radius to a all round circular radius, so we can tap into the border radius and
124

125
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,180
we can specify maybe 30 pixels of circular radius.
125

126
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,970
And now it looks like actual bubbles.
126

127
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,100
So now we've got some pretty good looking bubbles but it doesn't really make sense to have these sender
127

128
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,340
details inside the message bubbles
128

129
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,910
right?
129

130
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,850
So let's try and make it separate.
130

131
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:50,430
Let's wrap our material inside a column so that we can add a text widget at the top of the bubbles.
131

132
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:57,440
And here is where our sender is going to appear and then later on we'll have the material which is the
132

133
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,500
message bubble.
133

134
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,470
So let's delete that part and only have the text inside the text widget.
134

135
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,400
So now if we hit save, you can see that we have the sender details at the top and the text bubbles right
135

136
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,510
below it.
136

137
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:18,410
But at the moment the sender details is taking up a bit too much attention. It's too black and it's too
137

138
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,550
large.
138

139
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,570
So let's change the style of that text widget.
139

140
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:36,330
So that we can drop the font size down to maybe a 12 and we can change the color to maybe a black
140

141
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,290
54, so something just a tad bit lighter.
141

142
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:48,150
And now you can see that the main point is these messages and the sender name is just something that's
142

143
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,890
on top of it.
143

144
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,800
At this point we've done a lot of work on the styling front. But how can we improve our look even further?
144

145
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,910
Well at the moment, our bubbles are all in the center of the screen. So why don't we go ahead and move
145

146
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,680
it to one side.
146

147
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:16,970
So inside this column, let's change the cross axis alignment to crossAxisAlignment.end and this
147

148
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,910
will move it to one side. And we're starting to get to the point where it looks very very much like a
148

149
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,150
real messaging app right?
149

150
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,980
I keep talking about real messaging apps like it's like Pinocchio or something.
150

151
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,440
It's like you're a real messaging app now.
151

152
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,030
Well not yet actually,
152

153
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:41,420
we still have to do a few more things. Since we've been adding quite a lot of code into our app, it's
153

154
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,230
again time to consider refactoring our code.
154

155
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,350
Perhaps we can reorganize our code to make our chat application a bit simpler.
155

156
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,320
For example, I reckon our chat screen state is getting a bit long and unwieldy.
156

157
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,380
So why don't we extract our stream builder into a separate widget?
157

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,460
So down here just above the message bubble, I'm going to create a new stateless widget and I'm going
158

159
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,260
to call it my MessagesStream.
159

160
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:15,330
And here I want to be able to transplant all of this code that's inside the stream builder into one
160

161
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,520
place namely this place.
161

162
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,470
So instead of returning the container, I'm going to return the stream builder.
162

163
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:36,930
And we're going to instead create our MessageStream right here. So now the area that we have is related
163

164
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,280
to the fact that the Firestore is something that's only available currently right here for the chat
164

165
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,550
screens state.
165

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,200
So why don't we go ahead and move that out of there and right at the bottom of our import statements
166

167
00:13:52,260 --> 00:14:00,100
so that we can access it all over this file? So now that we fix that problem, our message stream no longer
167

168
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,000
has any errors and we're able to create message bubbles from all the messages that gets created inside
168

169
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,010
our app.
169

170
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:18,490
So if I go ahead and type a new message, 'Hey there' and hit send, you'll see it appear right here.
170

171
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,280
Now don't worry too much about the order for now.
171

172
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,570
I'll explain a little bit later on why it's not going in the order of being created.
172

173
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:32,200
But the last thing that I want to fix in terms of styling is that the moment when I hit the send button,
173

174
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,860
it should really clear the text field because it doesn't make sense for there to be text from something
174

175
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,780
that's already sent
175

176
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,030
right?
176

177
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,480
It should be empty, ready for the next message.
177

178
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,040
So how can we do this?
178

179
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:53,440
Well we can create something called a text editing controller. So let's create one for our message text
179

180
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,340
field so we'll call it messageTextController. And we're going to set it to equal a new text editing
180

181
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,530
controller.
181

182
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:08,890
Now once we've created this controller and make sure that there's no typos in it, then we'll be able
182

183
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,590
to use it inside our text field.
183

184
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:20,350
So the part where we have our text field is right here and it's got a property called a controller which
184

185
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,210
expects a text editing controller.
185

186
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,950
And guess what?
186

187
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,990
We've already made one.
187

188
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,580
It's the message text controller.
188

189
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:36,310
So now we have this controller which can control this text field so that when the user clicks on the
189

190
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:44,320
flat button and presses the send button, then we can tap into that same messageTextController which
190

191
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,260
we know controls this text field, and we can tell it to clear the text that's currently inside using
191

192
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,490
the clear method.
192

193
00:15:51,490 --> 00:16:01,400
So now if I hit save and if I conjure up another new message and hit send, you'll see that it disappears
193

194
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,880
as soon as I press the send button.
194

195
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,830
Perfect.
195

196
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,770
So that's exactly what we want. In the next lesson,
196

197
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,780
we're going to address something else. We're going to address the fact that at the moment when the message
197

198
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,950
is coming through from different senders say angela@email.com or angela@gmail.com or any other
198

199
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,630
users,
199

200
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,430
they're all showing up in the same color, in the same format.
200

201
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,350
It's really hard to tell which are the messages that I sent in which are the ones from other people.
201

202
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,030
So that's what we'll fix in the next lesson.
202

203
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,100
For all of that and more, I'll see you there.
