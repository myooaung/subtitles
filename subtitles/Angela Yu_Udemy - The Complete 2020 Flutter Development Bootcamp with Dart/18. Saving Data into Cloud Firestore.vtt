1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.800
So now that we're all done with authentication, our users can register,
1

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.760
they can log in,
2

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.120
they can log out.
3

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.560
We've got all the proper user interface setup for them.
4

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.280
It's time to actually move on to the chat screen and start saving the messages they type in the text
5

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.390
field here. So that the moment when they hit send that message goes right into our Firebase Cloud Fire
6

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.580
store over here and we should be able to see it inside our database.
7

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.760
Now as always, there's no shortage of documentation when it comes to Flutter and it's the same thing
8

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.400
with Firebase as well.
9

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.990
There's lots and lots of documentation on both the Flutter package pages,
10

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.370
so this is going to be Dart code that they're showing you here.
11

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.070
But also when you go on to a Firebase and you go over to their documentation, you'll be able to find
12

13
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.910
a large amount of documentation for all platforms,
13

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.350
iOS, Android, Web and I'm sure there will be Flutter specific documentation coming really soon.
14

15
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.700
I bet both of those teams are working hard on it. Now in order to start saving our data into our cloud
15

16
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.780
Firestore,
16

17
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.480
we're going to have to do a couple of bits of setup on the Firebase website first.
17

18
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.290
So we have to go into the database tab right here and then we're going to be able to click on Create
18

19
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.040
database to create our Cloud Firestore.
19

20
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.840
Now notice that there's also another type of database that Firebase offers which is the real time database.
20

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.750
Now this was their kind of the-one database I guess.
21

22
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.810
And it's very very fast but it's based off saving JSONs which is not as capable or as extensive as
22

23
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:57.240
their Firestore which is based on a NoSQL database. We're going to be using the latest and greatest
23

24
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.400
which is their Cloud Firestore.
24

25
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.050
So let's click on Create database and we're going to toggle over to start in test mode so that anybody
25

26
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.170
with the database reference can read and write to the database. A little bit later on once we're done
26

27
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.860
testing and we're ready to deploy our app onto the appstore, we'll change these rules to be a little bit
27

28
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.740
more secure.
28

29
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.860
But for now nobody knows about or cares about our app yet.
29

30
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.190
So let's go ahead and click on enable to create our Cloud Firestore.
30

31
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.410
Once the setup finishes you should see the database dashboard look something like this.
31

32
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.010
And here we have the ability of adding a collection.
32

33
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.420
So what are collections?
33

34
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.420
Well let's imagine that you're running a shop right? And you have to manage your inventory,
34

35
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.940
you have to manage your customers. So you might have an Excel spreadsheet for your customers.
35

36
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.550
You might have one for your products.
36

37
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.730
You might have one for your suppliers.
37

38
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.570
And these Excel spreadsheets are equivalent to our collections.
38

39
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.130
So we're going to need to create one called messages
39

40
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.310
and this is going to store all of our messages
40

41
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.220
and also the senders who sent those messages. And we're going to click next to be able to create some
41

42
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.890
fields.
42

43
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.620
So we're gonna create a sample data here to establish some fields.
43

44
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.020
So our first field is going to be called text
44

45
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.540
so this is going to be the message text.
45

46
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.320
It's going to be a string.
46

47
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.040
And let's give it some dummy value.
47

48
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.020
Let's just say something like hello.
48

49
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.170
And we're ready to add another field which is going to be our sender field.
49

50
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.750
Again another string and let's say that the first Sender was angela@email.com.
50

51
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.630
And now let's hit save and you'll see our first collection and our first piece of data appear inside
51

52
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.460
our database. So there it is.
52

53
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.840
It's all very easy to add data through the Firebase dashboard.
53

54
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.980
But what we need is to be able to add this data from our app based off what the user is typing. To do
54

55
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.660
that, we have to head over to our chat_screen.dart and we have to input the Cloud Firestore package.
55

56
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:26.030
And now we get to save the message that the user has typed into a variable maybe let's call it message
56

57
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:34.630
Text and we're going to set the value of the text field right here to that messageText variable.
57

58
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.560
So we'll set that equal to value.
58

59
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:47.120
And now we're ready to use the message text along with the loggedInUser.email to be able to send
59

60
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.930
that data over to our Cloud Firestore. And we're going to do that when the user presses on the send
60

61
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.350
button,
61

62
00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:02.330
so right here inside that onPressed call back. We know that we have access to the messageText through
62

63
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:11.900
that property messageText and we also have access to the sender which is the loggedInUser.email.
63

64
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.590
And it's also really important to remind yourselves of what you called the collection and what you called
64

65
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.780
the fields, sender and text.
65

66
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.270
Just make sure that when you use them in your code that you've typed it out exactly the same including
66

67
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.260
the capitalizations, they need to match.
67

68
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.430
Now we're ready to create a new instance of our Cloud Firestore.
68

69
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.140
So just as what we did with auth, we're going to create a Firestore which is going to equal Firestore
69

70
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.240
.instance
70

71
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:55.980
and we can use our firestore right here in the onPressed and we can tap into a collection of our choosing.
71

72
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.070
Now the path is the string that we specified for the name of the collection.
72

73
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.630
So it has to be messages
73

74
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.110
in my case, so I'll just put that in here, messages.
74

75
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.610
Make sure that you've got it exactly the same as what you have in your Firebase console.
75

76
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:21.410
And now we're ready to add some data to it. And notice that the add method expects a map data type.
76

77
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:28.360
So it has to be a map that has a string as the key and the value can be any data type.
77

78
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:36.820
So let's create a map by adding in our curly braces and our keys have to match with what we specified
78

79
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.660
as the fields of the documents in our collection.
79

80
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.390
So we've got sender and we've got text.
80

81
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.960
So let's start with text as the first key and the value for that of course should be the messageText
81

82
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.530
that the user typed in to the text field.
82

83
00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:01.810
And the second one is going to be the sender and the sender field is going to have the email address
83

84
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.250
of the logged in user.
84

85
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.300
This is the easiest way of identifying a user to see which messages they sent.
85

86
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.880
So now we're all ready to test it out.
86

87
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:22.670
So let's hit run and check out our app. Let's go ahead and log in as angela@email.com and put
87

88
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.620
in my password, click log in and now I'm going to type a message.
88

89
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.820
Let's just type 'Hello World' and hit send.
89

90
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.970
Now nothing's going to happen over here because we haven't handled that yet, but if we go into our console
90

91
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:46.070
and we hit refresh or click on the little button here, then once our console loads up, we should see that
91

92
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.230
our message's collection has now two pieces of data.
92

93
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:57.240
This is the original one and this is the one that we added just now via our app.
93

94
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:05.530
So we're actually now able to save data into our collection in our Cloud Firestore.
94

95
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.370
And now all we have to do is to retrieve the data.
95

96
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.900
So that's what we're gonna be doing in the coming lessons.
