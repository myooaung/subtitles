1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,410
Now in the final version of this app, we want to be able to select various currencies such as US dollars
1

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:15,090
or euros or pounds and check to see what one bitcoin is worth in all of those currencies.
2

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,870
So we need a way of being able to select from all of those currencies. And you can see all of the ones
3

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,680
that we're planning on incorporating if you have a look inside the coin_data
4

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,240
.dart file. Here we've got our constant which is a list of strings and it contains all of the currencies
5

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,840
that we're going to check the value of bitcoin for.
6

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,770
But in order to select which one we want to show the values of, we need some sort of user interface element
7

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,810
to do that.
8

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,080
And the easiest way of doing it is through the use of something called a dropdown button.
9

10
00:00:52,430 --> 00:01:00,150
So a dropdown button comes from the material design concept and it looks something like this.
10

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,320
So you click on a button and it shows you various things that you can select from.
11

12
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,230
Let's try to integrate this into our app and make it display all of those currencies that we have listed
12

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:20,970
in our currencies list. As always our starting point is the documentation and it tells us to simply just
13

14
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,870
build out a dropdown button as a widget.
14

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:32,090
Let's go into our price screen and currently inside our container where it has a child of null,
15

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:40,740
we're going to replace it with a dropdown button and it's got only two required properties, items and
16

17
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,740
onChanged.
17

18
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,530
So onChanged is going to be when the user selects a new item from that dropdown,
18

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,570
this is going to trigger a callback and it's going to tell us what the user changed it to.
19

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:00,600
And then the items are the things that will go into that drop down menu. Now in order to use it
20

21
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,560
we have to specify what is the type of data that our dropdown button is going to display.
21

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,020
So it's going to be strings
22

23
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,690
in this case and also in our case as well.
23

24
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:20,070
So let's add that dropdown button of type string. And then inside the items property, we have to specify
24

25
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:29,690
what it is that we want to display on the screen. The items property expects a list of dropped down menu
25

26
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,800
items.
26

27
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,000
And this is going to be the list of items that the user can select from.
27

28
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,830
So let's go ahead and create that.
28

29
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,850
So instead of null, we need to create a list.
29

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,930
So let's open up a set of square brackets and we need to create a list specifically of DropDownMenu
30

31
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:58,130
Items. And each drop down menu item expects a child and the child has a type of widget.
31

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,340
So that means we need to put a widget in as a child of the drop down menu item.
32

33
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,310
So I'm going to create a simple text widget and it's going to contain one of our currency say USD for
33

34
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,900
example.
34

35
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,020
Now the drop down menu item also has another property called value.
35

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,200
And this means that when the dropdown button is clicked on and the user clicks on one of these dropdown
36

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,410
menus, it's going to trigger the onChanged and pass in whatever is inside this value property.
37

38
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,740
So we want that to match with what's inside our text widget
38

39
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,950
so we're going to add again the string that is just USD. Let's go ahead and add a couple more of these
39

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,110
so I'm going to add one for euros and one for pounds.
40

41
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,230
So EUR and GBP.
41

42
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:59,450
So now we should have a dropdown button with three items in it. But as per usual with any sort of button,
42

43
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,420
if it's onChanged is null, it'll usually be in the disabled state.
43

44
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,240
So we won't actually be able to see it unless we change this property.
44

45
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:18,320
So inside the onChanged, we're going to have a callback that's going to send us the value that the user
45

46
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,230
selected and then inside that callback, we'll be able to tap into that value, whatever it may be.
46

47
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,820
This means that if the user taps on this one which has a value of GBP, then GBP will be what's going
47

48
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,950
to be the input into our callback and we'll be able to access it through our print statement. Let's hit
48

49
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,230
save for reload to happen and let's pop open our run.
49

50
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,160
So we should now see in this bottom container here, a little down arrow. And if we click on it, we can
50

51
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,430
see a menu with three drop down menu items.
51

52
00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:00,980
Now if I select one of these, for example the euro, then the value of that drop down menu item is 
52

53
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,550
EUR.
53

54
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:08,450
And at the moment when I click on it my onChanged is going to trigger this function passing in that
54

55
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,890
value in here and it gets printed into our console.
55

56
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,050
Now at the moment, it's kind of hard to see what this is
56

57
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,750
right?
57

58
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:25,850
So usually with dropdown buttons, one of the properties that's really useful is the value property. Where
58

59
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,330
we can specify a starting value
59

60
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,520
and it's usually going to be the first item in the list.
60

61
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,900
So let's hit save.
61

62
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,100
And now you should see that it starts out with a default value of USD.
62

63
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,500
And as soon as you click on it and you change it, then we can select a different value.
63

64
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,700
But why doesn't it update the value of our dropdown button?
64

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,320
Well similar to the slider that we used when we created the BMI calculator, we have to update this value
65

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,480
property when the state of our dropdown button changes.
66

67
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:12,010
So to do that, we're going to create a new property and we're going to call it a selectedCurrency and
67

68
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,080
it's going to be of type String.
68

69
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:24,270
And it's going to have a starting value of what we want to see initially in the dropdown, which is going
69

70
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,490
to be USD.
70

71
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:34,920
And now what we can do is instead of using the string USD, we can use that selected currency property
71

72
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,050
that we just created.
72

73
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:45,150
And also when our user selects a value from our dropdown button, then we can set these selected currency
73

74
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,790
to equal that new value.
74

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,030
And of course if we want this to update in Flutter, we have to wrap it inside a set state.
75

76
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,340
So now we're going to put that inside our set state and if we hit save
76

77
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:07,950
now when we click on our dropdown and we select a new value, it will update that value that is shown
77

78
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,290
for our dropdown button.
78

79
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:17,730
So we now have a dropdown button which functions and we're able to tap into the user selected currency
79

80
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,120
through this new property that we created.
80

81
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:31,020
So this is all very well and good but you can see that in our currencies list, we have loads of different
81

82
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:39,900
currencies and it would be really painful to add them all one by one through creating a new drop down
82

83
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:48,180
menu item widget and then having a child of a text widget and then having a value, that's really painful.
83

84
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,380
What can we do instead?
84

85
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:59,400
Well we could create a loop that loops through our list of currencies and create a drop down menu item
85

86
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,600
for each of them
86

87
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,020
and putting those currencies inside a text widget and inside the value property.
87

88
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,820
Now if you think you can already solve this by creating a FOR loop, then you can skip the next lesson.
88

89
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,780
But if can't or if you want to review how loops work in Dart, then head over to the next lesson and I'm
89

90
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,990
going to cover the various types of FOR loops in Dart.
