00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.840
So in the last lesson we've already gotten pretty far with designing our app to make it look like the
1

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.010
mockup.
2

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.390
And now all we have to do is add our list view with our task items inside.
3

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.380
Let's go into our Android Studio and let's go ahead and expand everything out so that we see our structure.
4

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.340
So
5

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.750
currently we have a scaffold with a floating action button and a column.
6

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.770
That column contains a container which is the top part of the app
7

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.690
and also another container that's taking up the bottom part of the app.
8

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.360
So it's in this bottom container where we want to add our list view.
9

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.740
Let's select it so that we can get to the right place in our widget tree
10

11
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.230
and here's the challenge coming up.
11

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.510
You've already created list views in the last module,
12

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.060
you know what they look like,
13

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.880
you know what they require
14

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.000
and you've got the mockup for what we want to create.
15

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.120
So try and use some of the Flutter documentation or maybe have a look online to search around on Stack Overflow
16

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.920
and see if you can recreate the appearance of the mockup by creating your very own list view using what
17

18
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590
you've learned so far.
18

19
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.690
And once you've had a go at it, then come back over here and I'll show you the solution.
19

20
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.790
So once you're ready, pause the video and give that a go.
20

21
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.430
All right.
21

22
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.370
So let's go through the solution.
22

23
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.960
Firstly you'll notice that the place where we want to create our list view is our container.
23

24
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.140
And this particular container doesn't yet have a child.
24

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.790
That's what we're going to add, the child property.
25

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.890
Now the child in this case is of course going to be a list view which is going to help us setup and
26

27
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.320
layout, our To Do list.
27

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.390
Now inside our list view, there are a whole bunch of properties that we could change
28

29
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.810
but the most important is it's children.
29

30
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.390
What's going to go inside that list?
30

31
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
Well in our case, we're actually going to use another handy widget,
31

32
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.900
the ListTile.
32

33
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.870
And this is going to make it super easy for us to simply just create a reusable tile which has properties
33

34
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.300
such as the title,
34

35
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.650
so what's going to go into the main part of the list.
35

36
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.400
Things like trailing, what's going to go in at the end or leading, what's going to go in at the front
36

37
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.150
and it has properties such as onTap and everything you would normally expect from a core widget.
37

38
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.730
So let's go ahead and add a title and it wants a text widget and this text widget is going to say, 'This
38

39
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.800
is a task.'
39

40
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.340
So now let's hit save.
40

41
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.330
You see our list item
41

42
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.510
show up right here.
42

43
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.760
So what about the little checkbox?
43

44
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.860
Well that's gonna go into the trailing part, so the end of this list tile. And easily enough
44

45
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.050
there's a checkbox widget and all we have to do is to give it a value.
45

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.120
So do you want it to be checked or unchecked?
46

47
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.640
Well let's start it out with unchecked.
47

48
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.720
So there's our little checkbox. And if you want more than one less tile then let's just go ahead and
48

49
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.340
copy another one in.
49

50
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.370
So we've got two tasks now in our list.
50

51
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.310
But notice how, once I've got my tiles in, it starts looking a little bit odd
51

52
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.860
right?
52

53
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.670
Because if we take a look at our mockup, you can see that everything is all neatly aligned and this is
53

54
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:53.940
really one of the designers best kept secrets. As long as everything aligns to a single point or a single
54

55
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.560
line,
55

56
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.350
then you can make anything look pretty good without a lot of effort.
56

57
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.010
So let's do that for our list view as well. So because we're in a container we of course have our padding
57

58
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.070
property.
58

59
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.530
So I'm simply going to add a padding that goes on the left and right.
59

60
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.940
So that's going to be edge insets symmetric.
60

61
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.420
So I only need to specify the horizontal,
61

62
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.230
that means the left and the right.
62

63
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.600
And it's going to be maybe a 20 pixel to match up with the previous one.
63

64
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.310
So now it looks a lot neater and a lot more designed
64

65
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.500
right?
65

66
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.030
So now that we've pretty much created our list view, it's kind of getting a bit messy in here in our
66

67
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.810
task screen. And we don't want everything to be all sitting in the same place.
67

68
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.640
So let's go ahead and extract some of our widgets. Now
68

69
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.420
firstly the one that we want to get rid of is probably going to be our list view.
69

70
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.570
So let's click on our list view in our Flutter outline and let's go ahead and extract our widget.
70

71
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:08.500
So I'm going to call this the TasksList and go ahead and hit refactor. And then down here inside our
71

72
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.340
task list,
72

73
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.590
we've still got our list tiles right?
73

74
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.520
So I'm going to take one of these and I'm gonna go ahead and extract it.
74

75
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.330
So this is going to be a TaskTile.
75

76
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.860
And now I've got it all refracted and we're ready to tidy things up.
76

77
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.130
As always, I'm going to get rid of the new keyword
77

78
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:35.110
and I'm also going to get rid of all the constructors for the automatically created or extracted widgets
78

79
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.130
because we don't really need them.
79

80
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.570
We're not actually passing anything over to construct.
80

81
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.110
And then we've got another new keyword here and that will clean up our code a little bit.
81

82
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.820
So now that we've extracted our task tile into a separate widget, we don't have to write out all the
82

83
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.410
code for the widgets anymore.
83

84
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.060
We can just simply create another task tile as in when we need it.
84

85
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.110
So let's create another task tile here and maybe let's add a third one down here.
85

86
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.560
So now we have three tasks all with that checkboxes and the titles.
86

87
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:21.280
Now we're at a checkpoint so let's hit save and let's go ahead and create a new folder to keep hold
87

88
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.980
of each of these little items, little extracted widgets. And I'm going to call this folder
88

89
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.980
the widgets folder because these are kind of all custom widgets that we've created
89

90
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.030
right?
90

91
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.920
And inside the widgets folder let's create some Dart files.
91

92
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:45.780
One of these is going to be that tasks_list and another one is going to be the task_
92

93
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.140
title.
93

94
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.930
So in both of these we're going to need to import our material package.
94

95
00:06:52.090 --> 00:07:00.250
So we might as well go ahead and do that now. And then I'm simply going to copy over the relevant stateless
95

96
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.790
widgets.
96

97
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.840
So tasks list is going to go into here
97

98
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:15.580
and the task tile is gonna go over here. So now we've got a couple of errors in our Dart analysis.
98

99
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:22.940
The method task list isn't defined for this class so it doesn't know about it because we haven't imported
99

100
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.060
it.
100

101
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.730
So, naughty us.
101

102
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:32.030
So let's go ahead and add widgets/tasks_list.dart
102

103
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.750
and now it knows exactly what we're talking about.
103

104
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.610
But over here, we've still got three errors because it doesn't know what task tiles are.
104

105
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:47.740
So let's go ahead and import our widgets folder and our task_tile.dart.
105

106
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:56.420
So now, we've pretty much gotten rid of all of our errors, so the ones in red, and all we have now are
106

107
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.790
simply just some warnings,
107

108
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:06.890
so the ones in yellow. And inside our app, we've pretty much got our whole interface created where we've
108

109
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:16.470
got the top area, our column of title and icon and little bit of subtitle and then we've got our little
109

110
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:23.810
list here which is scrollable, we've got checkboxes and the list items and we've got our action
110

111
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.510
button.
111

112
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:31.160
Now don't worry if you you're trying this out and it doesn't work. The checkbox won't work yet because
112

113
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:38.720
we haven't yet added any code that tells it how to behave, which we're going to do very shortly. But for
113

114
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.350
now if we take a look over here in our Dart analysis, we've got some things that we need to sort out. Firstly
114

115
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.500
the parameter onPressed is required.
115

116
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:56.130
So whenever a widget has required properties or parameters that we haven't given it, it will highlight
116

117
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.090
it in this light yellow.
117

118
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.160
And when you hover over it, it'll tell you what's missing, in this case our floating action button has
118

119
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:10.760
all of this nice layout but it actually doesn't yet know what it should do when it's pressed.
119

120
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.640
So let's add our onPressed call back and inside here, what should happen.
120

121
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:25.490
Well when we click on this plus button here, we actually want it to slide up something that allows us
121

122
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:33.680
to input a new task. And if we look back at our mockup and we go onto the second page, you can see this is
122

123
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.220
what we're kind of trying to do right?
123

124
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.950
We're gonna get a new container that slides up and it's also got the nice round edges and here we'll
124

125
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.630
be able to type in a new task and then add it to our to do list.
125

126
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.130
So that's what we're going to be tackling in the next lesson.
126

127
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.050
So for all of that and more, I'll see there.
