1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,480
Now let's get started building our final product, which is our business card of sorts,
1

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:15,310
but in an app. Now you can see that the layout, naturally, goes from top to bottom. So the most appropriate
2

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:21,700
layout widget that we're going to be using, is of course, a column. And inside our column, we'll have maybe
3

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,990
something that can display an image in a circle,
4

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:33,370
a bit of text that shows our name, a little bit about what we do and then maybe a horizontal line to
5

6
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:40,390
separate this top part with the bottom part, which are these two sort of material cards if you will, that
6

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,200
show our phone number and our contact details.
7

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,750
Let's get started making this using what we've just learned.
8

9
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,470
So I'm going to delete everything from the end of the row, where it says here with that comment, all the
9

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,070
way to the start of the row. And instead I'm going to have a column.
10

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,660
Now, my column of course, needs to have that children parameter.
11

12
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,660
And now I get to specify what children I want inside my column.
12

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,320
The first child is going to be something called a Circle Avatar.
13

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,390
And you can see that if you hover on this and wait for it, it'll show you the quick docs. And it tells
14

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,650
you that if you choose this one, you will get a circle that represents a user, typically used with a user
15

16
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,750
profile image and the image will be cropped to have a circle shape.
16

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,100
So even though we're not really building a profile, in this case still makes sense to use this widget
17

18
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,650
so that we get our image automatically filled into a circle.
18

19
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:50,530
And there's lots of these widgets that the Flutter team have created for common use cases such as building
19

20
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,780
out a user profile or whatever it may be.
20

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,350
And we're going to explore some of those already in this module.
21

22
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,940
What are the sort of things that we can put in a circle avatar?
22

23
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,720
Well, if you click on the circle avatar, and if you're on a Mac, if you hit CONTROL + J, or if you're on Windows, you
23

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,250
hit CONTROL + Q, you'll end up with the quick docs.
24

25
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:19,270
Now the quick docs will show you what are all the things that you can set about this circle avatar, including
25

26
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:28,870
its background color, its child so something it contains, a background image or a foreground color, or
26

27
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,250
the radius. We're going to keep ours really simple. We're going to give it a radius and it's just going
27

28
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,830
to be 50.
28

29
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,420
So this is gonna show up just as a simple circle with the default blue color.
29

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,930
Now, the next thing we're going to change about it, is I don't like it being blue.
30

31
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,930
So what if I wanted to specify a color?
31

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,950
So let's give it a background color of it.
32

33
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,690
Let's say red.
33

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,560
So I can change all of these properties that I discover through using my quick docs. And depending on
34

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,620
what it is that you want to set for the radius or the image, then you can customize your widgets
35

36
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:17,950
like so. Instead of having a background color, as a challenge, I want you to figure out how you can add
36

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,870
a picture of yourself, or an image that you find on the Internet, and you going to set up your assets
37

38
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,160
to be able to display that image inside the circle avatar.
38

39
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,270
So, through the use of quick docs and what you've learned before, try and complete this challenge and
39

40
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:45,630
see if you can turn it into a circle like this, with your own custom picture. All right I hope you gave
40

41
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,320
that a go and you remembered how to do it.
41

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,290
But here on my desktop, I've got a picture of myself and I'm going to rename it to make my life a little
42

43
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,640
bit easier later on so I don't have to type out all of that when I try to add my picture to my code.
43

44
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,290
So I'm just gonna call it Angela and I'm going to keep the extension,
44

45
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,820
in this case the picture is actually a JPEG.
45

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,750
Then I'm gonna go into my photo project and I'm going to create a new directory, and I'm going to call
46

47
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,410
this images.
47

48
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,420
So now, I'm going to drag and drop my image, into the images folder, and then click OK
48

49
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,420
when I get prompted. At this point, because we got our project off of GitHub, it asks us, whether if we want
49

50
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,680
to track the changes that we're making to this project. And you can go ahead and click yes. Here we've
50

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,410
got our image and it's now inside our project under a folder called images.
51

52
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,260
This is the perfect time to go into our pubspec.yaml and clean up a lot of these comments. And then
52

53
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,770
we can go ahead and add in the parts that we need.
53

54
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,760
So remember the comment start with a pound sign or a hashtag if you will, and try to not accidentally
54

55
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:04,370
delete parts that are not comments like the SDK. Because otherwise, you might end up with some problems.
55

56
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,920
So I'm also going to delete all of this but I'm going to go ahead and add my image asset in here.
56

57
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,950
So I'm gonna select all of that, and I'm going to hold on COMMAND or CONTROL, and hit the forward slash
57

58
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,210
button.
58

59
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,520
Now remember that our YAML file is really really delicate about how we indent it.
59

60
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:31,220
So the assets has to be on the same line as the user's material design, because it is a child of our
60

61
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,510
Flutter settings.
61

62
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,000
And then, the image that we want is gonna be indented by two spaces. So you can hit the space-bar twice
62

63
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,280
or hit the tab button if you want to.
63

64
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,410
Now inside our images folder,
64

65
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,080
I've got an image called angela.jpeg
65

66
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,570
Now yours might be called something else, and then we're going to run packages.get to add those images
66

67
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,500
to our project.
67

68
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,880
So now, we're ready to change our circle avatar. Instead of having a background color,
68

69
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:09,600
we're going to have a background image instead. And our image is going to be an asset image, and the name
69

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:21,000
of the image is of course images/angela.jpeg Let's hit save, and we should see our image show
70

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,960
up in our little circle avatar here.
71

72
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,160
Brilliant.
72

73
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,120
Did you manage to get that right?
73

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,870
If you have any trouble with the asset image and also understanding how the pubspec.yaml works,
74

75
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:40,450
be sure to review the lesson we talked all about how to import images into our project assets, where
75

76
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,610
we go into that in more detail. Now that we've set up our circle avatar,
76

77
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,490
the next step is to add our name to our business card.
77

78
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:59,140
And so I'm going to add a text widget. And the text it's going to contain, is simply going to be my name.
78

79
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,060
At this stage, you can see that the text shows up in the default layout.
79

80
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,290
So it's just a piece of black text in the default font.
80

81
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,440
It'll just be a piece of small text that's in black, that shows up in our column underneath the previous
81

82
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,900
child.
82

83
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,320
Now, what if we wanted to style it up a little bit?
83

84
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,380
What if we wanted to customize the styling of our text?
84

85
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,010
Well, we can take a look at the piece of text, hit COMMAND + J or CONTROL + Q and see what other things that
85

86
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,910
we can change about it.
86

87
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,270
Well, we can change the data that goes in.
87

88
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,890
So, in our case, it's Angela Yu. We can change the style of it.
88

89
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,590
That seems like what we want right.
89

90
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,890
So we have to set a property called style, and it's going to be of type text style.
90

91
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,300
So let's try that.
91

92
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,120
Let's add the style property, and let's change it to a text style.
92

93
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,660
Now what kind of things can we do with text though?
93

94
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:03,730
Well Android Studio is very helpful in pointing out we can set the color, the font size, the font weight,
94

95
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,540
font style, letter spacing, all of these things.
95

96
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,350
And let's start by changing the font size.
96

97
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,960
And I'm gonna change it to a 40 point font, and I'm going to hit save
97

98
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,310
so we can see what it looks like.
98

99
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,630
Yeah, that looks pretty good,
99

100
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,720
size wise. And then I'm gonna change the color. I want it to be a white color.
100

101
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,700
So let's write colors.white to get our material palette, and change it to white.
101

102
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,020
Yes looking instantly better.
102

103
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,840
The last thing I'm gonna do, is I'm going to make it bold. So I'm going to write font weight, and I'm going
103

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:49,300
to write fontweight.bold. And now let's hit save, and you can see that we now have a bolded piece
104

105
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,140
of text that's going to represent our name.
105

106
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:58,540
Now the only difference, between how it looks in our project, and how we want it to ultimately look is,
106

107
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,530
that this is a different font.
107

108
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:09,460
So how can we incorporate our custom fonts into our projects, rather than just using the system default
108

109
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,450
fonts..
109

110
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,660
Well to find out about that, you'll have to head over to the next lesson.
