00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.810
Now in previous lessons, we learned how we can wrap our images inside a flat button, so that when we click
1

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.850
on it we get something happening namely printing out the words 'Left
2

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.910
button got pressed' or 'Right button got pressed'.
3

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.040
Now that's not very interesting right?
4

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.500
It's not a great app as it is because the user can't see that. We need to be able to update our images
5

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.310
depending on when the user presses the button.
6

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.640
We know that our images come from our assets which include all of the images inside this images folder.
7

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.490
So that means I can tap into any of the dice images that I see here by simply changing that number.
8

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.480
So I could change it to a dice four and I hit save. Hot reload happens, and my left die becomes the fourth
9

10
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.990
die.
10

11
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.440
Now I frequently mess up the plural and singular of dice and die, so just bear with me here.
11

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.880
So again, we're not really interested in changing the code and then hot reloading and then changing the
12

13
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.670
image. The user can't do this either,
13

14
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.250
right?
14

15
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:17.660
We need to somehow link the changing of this one number to the user pressing a button. That way it actually
15

16
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.640
becomes an app with functionality.
16

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.990
What we're going to do is we're going to create a variable up here, inside our stateless widget here.
17

18
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.810
And we're going to create the variable by using the keyword var, and we're going to give our variable a
18

19
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.110
name, namely leftDiceNumber.
19

20
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.100
And this is going to refer to the number of the die that's going to be displayed on the left.
20

21
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.760
So we're going to change that to equal one.
21

22
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.070
And now, instead of having this being hardcoded, we're going to delete it and we're going to insert this
22

23
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
variable. And to do that in Dart, we're gonna use the dollar sign.
23

24
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.120
So we get to add one variable after the dollar sign.
24

25
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.470
And this is going to be the leftDiceNumber.
25

26
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.820
So now, when I run my app again, you'll notice there's just one problem.
26

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.070
If I change this variable now to say five, and I go ahead and I click on hot reload or I hit save, the change
27

28
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.820
doesn't actually happen here. Because remember that I said previously, when we hot reload, the thing that
28

29
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.390
gets rerun is our build method here.
29

30
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.670
So the block of code that's between that curly brace and this curly brace. So everything in between will
30

31
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.260
get triggered again and any changes in there will be reflected here.
31

32
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.390
But if our dice number is outside of our build method, then the change won't be reflected in our app.
32

33
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.430
So I have to cut this and paste it into here. And then if I hit save, then this build method gets rerun.
33

34
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:14.480
Our left dice number gets set to five, and wherever it's used gets updated. So where we create our variables
34

35
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.190
and where we use them matters a huge deal. But now instead of having a hardcoded number in here that
35

36
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.890
is one or two or five, we now have a variable that's determining what it is.
36

37
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.800
And so if this variables equal to five, then this line becomes images/dice5.png It gets
37

38
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.820
inserted in here. And this is all because we're able to use variables in Dart to achieve this.
38

39
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.610
So in the next lesson, I want to talk a little bit more about variables in Dart. And especially for those
39

40
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.650
you guys who are seeing variables for the first time, it'll be really important to understand how they
40

41
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.380
work and especially how they work in Dart.
41

42
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.470
So for all of that and more, I see on the next lesson.
