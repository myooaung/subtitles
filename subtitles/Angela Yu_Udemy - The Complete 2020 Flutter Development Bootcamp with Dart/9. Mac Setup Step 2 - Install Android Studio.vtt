00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.630
So now that we've installed the Flutter SDK, we're going to skip ahead and we're going to set up first
1

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.690
for Android, and it's going to become really clear a little bit later on, why we're doing it in this order.
2

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:21.680
Now the first thing you need to do is to install Android Studio so head over to this link, and you can
3

4
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.930
click on this button which will automatically recognize that the operating system you're running and
4

5
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.070
it will automatically start downloading Android Studio.
5

6
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.650
Now once that's done, then launch Android Studio and go through the setup wizard.
6

7
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.420
Now this is going to install the latest Android SDK, the Android SDK platform tools and also build tools,
7

8
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.720
which are required by Flutter when developing for Android.
8

9
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.070
So simply go through the wizard and click yes to basically everything, and keep all of the default settings.
9

10
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.760
And once you're done, we're going to go ahead and add the Flutter and Dart plugins to our Android Studio.
10

11
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.230
Now if you're looking at the welcome screen, you can access the properties by going to configure and
11

12
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.260
clicking on preferences.
12

13
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.130
Now if you're ready got Android Studio open, then you can simply click on Android Studio, and you should
13

14
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.530
have access to preferences as well.
14

15
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.360
Now here, we're going to go to the plugins tab, and you're going to go to browse repositories to look
15

16
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.310
for the Flutter plugin.
16

17
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.810
So we're going to type in 'flutter' in here.
17

18
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.490
And the one which just as Flutter with a capital F,
18

19
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.930
that's the one that you need and you're going to download it and install it onto your Android Studio.
19

20
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.230
Now you're going to click accept to install third party plugins, and you're also going to click yes when
20

21
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.810
it asked you whether if you want to install Dart alongside Flutter. We'll need Dart and we'll need Flutter,
21

22
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.920
so we're going to click yes as well.
22

23
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.070
Now once it's done, you're going to click on this button to restart Android Studio, and click okay to
23

24
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100
close down the preferences pane.
24

25
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.120
So now it should ask you whether if you want to restart now, restart later, we're going to restart now.
25

26
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.850
And once Android Studio loads up again, then we should be ready to go to create Flutter apps.
26

27
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.070
So you'll notice that after that step, the major difference is that we now have a new option. Instead
27

28
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.830
of just starting a new Android Studio project,
28

29
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.630
we get to create new Flutter projects as well.
29

30
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.480
Straight from the welcome screen.
30

31
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.360
So we're gonna go ahead and click on this and select a Flutter Application as what we want to build,
31

32
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.280
click next and then we're going to name the app simply just testing_app and make sure that
32

33
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.360
you've got the Flutter SDK path specified in here.
33

34
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.590
This is how Android Studio is gonna be able to find the Flutter package.
34

35
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.740
Now Android Studio's clever enough to find this automatically, but if it's blank then be sure just to
35

36
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.100
click on the three dots here and locate this Flutter folder for it.
36

37
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.160
Now I'm going to leave that well alone because that's the right path.
37

38
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.860
Now the project location is where this current project is going to be saved too.
38

39
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.530
And by default it goes to Android Studio projects.
39

40
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.060
Doesn't really matter where you save it at the moment, because we're going to be deleting this app very
40

41
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.910
shortly.
41

42
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.600
But once you're done with this screen, let's head to the next screen and we're going to leave everything
42

43
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.510
as it is and just click finish.
43

44
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.930
Now Android Studio is going to create a demo Flutter project which the Flutter team created.
44

45
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.150
It's a really simple counter app and it just has a single button which increases a counter. So here's
45

46
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.550
our Dart code.
46

47
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.940
And here are all the files that make up our Flutter app.
47

48
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.590
Now if you've gotten to the screen, then you're pretty much ready to move on to the next step where we're
48

49
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.870
going to setup an android emulator to be able to run this app on Android.
49

50
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.890
So for all of that and more, I'll see on the next lesson.
