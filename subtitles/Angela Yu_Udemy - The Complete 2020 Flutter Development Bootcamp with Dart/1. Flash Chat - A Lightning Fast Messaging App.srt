Welcome to a really exciting module. In this module
1

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,500
we're going to be building a chat app. And not only is it going to look beautiful, but it's also going
2

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,970
to be super powerful because we're going to power our messenger using Firebase Firestore. And this is
3

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,730
what I'll look like by the time we're done.
4

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,140
So it's got some beautiful animations and we're gonna be looking at how to implement animations in
5

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,210
Flutter but also we're going to be creating this beautiful messenger user interface and we're going
6

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,180
to be able to set up a group chat and we're also going to implement authentication and registration
7

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,890
so the users will be able to register and log in so that they can chat with other users. First things
8

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,280
first.
9

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,600
As always we're going to head over to the GitHub Repository for flash chats and we're going to clone
10

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,980
that repository into our local system.
11

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:59,540
So we're going to check out project from version control and we're gonna go ahead and clone this project.
12

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,080
And once it's done, it will open it up and get our dependencies.
13

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,230
So if you take a look inside our lib folder, you'll see that we have a whole bunch of screens so let's
14

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,270
open all of them up.
15

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,670
We've got our welcome screen, our log in and registration screens and finally we've got our chat screen where
16

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,940
the chats are going to actually happen. Once you already and setup, head over to the next lesson where
17

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,120
we're going to get started building out our Flash Chat app.
