My name is Angela

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,860
from my courses have gone on to work for companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and others have created

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,540
top 10 apps that have been featured by Apple and Google.

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,560
Without a doubt, this is the best course that I have made to date.

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:40,170
You'll learn Flutter from scratch to build fast, beautiful, native quality, iOS and Android apps using
7

8
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:48,360
just one code base. And you'll build tons of beautiful apps and projects to add to your portfolio. By

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,310
the end of the course,
9

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,160
you will be a fully fledged Flutter developer by mastering things such as stateful and stateless widgets,
10

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,980
declarative programming, Lisp views, animations, streams, futures and much much more.
11

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,520
Companies like Ali Baba, The Hamilton Musical, and of course Google themselves are already using flutter
12

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,530
in their production apps right now.
13

14
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:23,140
Flutter lets you build iOS, Android and even Web Apps using just one programming language -  Dart.
14

15
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:30,060
So instead of learning Java or Kotlin to build Android apps and then learning Swift or Objective C to
15

16
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,630
build your iOS apps, you can do it all in one go, with Flutter.
16

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I've spent months building out the curriculum with the Google Flutter team to make sure that it covers
17

18
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:47,340
all of the key components involved in Flutter development. So whether if you're new to Flutter, or if
18

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,370
this is even the first time you thought about making mobile apps, this course will turn you into a skilled
19

20
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,450
Flutter developer with a beautiful portfolio of Flutter apps.
20

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,470
So what are you waiting for.
