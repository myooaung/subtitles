0
1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:09,790
So in the last lesson, we switched up our stateless widget into a stateful widget. And now all the parts
1

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,900
of our screen which will update when the user interacts with it, namely parts that need to change their
2

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,190
state, is now inside something called a dice page state.
3

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:31,600
And here, we have a button that detects when the user presses on it. And when that happens, we tell the
4

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,810
app that we need to change state.
5

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,210
And the thing that needs to change is everywhere that uses the leftDiceNumber.
6

7
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:50,620
So when that happens, we look through this tree and our app will mark all the widgets that use that updated
7

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,520
value.
8

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,700
And it finds this one right here.
9

10
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:04,450
So now, it will update our image widget and redraw it with the updated dice image.
10

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,400
There's just one thing. We're still having to manually update the number here,
11

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,040
right?
12

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:17,500
If I type four and I hit save and I press the button, then it changes to four. But the user cannot change
13

14
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,440
our code.
14

15
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:29,970
So how can we get this left dice number to automatically change to a new random number between 1 and 6?
15

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,690
Well in order to do this, we need to import a new library.
16

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,530
The math library. If you were trying to get really good at knitting, then you might go into your local
17

18
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,460
library.
18

19
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,700
You might take out all of the books on knitting,
19

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,790
take it home. Study it. Read it. Learn it.
20

21
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,330
And in an ideal world, then you would be a world expert on knitting. And you'll be able to do all sorts
21

22
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,770
of knitting: knitting hats, knitting socks, knitting jumpers.
22

23
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,620
But if next week you decided that you wanted to be able to do things in the garden, you wanted to be able
23

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:14,830
to grow things, then you might check out the parts of the gardening library. In order to generate random
24

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,630
numbers,
25

26
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:23,080
we can check out the Dart math library. And this is a library that contains all sorts of mathematical
26

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,420
constants and functions plus a random number generator.
27

28
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,690
That's exactly what we need.
28

29
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,550
And once you use this library in your code by importing it into your project, then the things that your
29

30
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:44,770
program will be able to do include generate random numbers, or know what is the base of the natural logarithms.
30

31
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,990
That's a lot more maths than I would know, off the top of my head.
31

32
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,290
So let's go ahead and put that into our project. So we're going to go right up to the top and you can
32

33
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,290
see that we're already importing a library. And this is the material.dart library.
33

34
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,870
And this includes all the things such as how should a flat bottom look as opposed to a raise button?
34

35
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:15,190
The fact that we're able to simply just type out a widget like a flat button, and it knows exactly what
35

36
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,500
that should look like, how it should behave, is all thanks to this library.
36

37
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,920
So now we're going to power up our project even further by importing the Dart maths library.
37

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,840
So start writing maths,
38

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,520
it'll find the right one for you. Hit enter.
39

40
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,630
And we've now got the maths library.
40

41
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,480
Now initially, it'll show up as grey because it's telling you that you've quoted this library, but you're
41

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,640
not using it yet.
42

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
It's just getting a bit ahead of us.
43

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:50,500
We're gonna use it right now. Instead of setting our leftDiceNumber equal to 4 or 3 or 1 manually, which
44

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,930
is quite painful,
45

46
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:59,500
instead we're going to use something that comes along with the math library which is called random. And
46

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,450
random has a function called nextInt.
47

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,300
And how do I know this?
48

49
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,660
Well I read through the documentations. If we look at the random generator, then we can see that it has
49

50
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,430
a method called nextInt.
50

51
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:27,520
And this generates a non-negative random integer, so a random whole number, from 0 up to max and not including,
51

52
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,800
so excluding the max.
52

53
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,490
So the max is what you put inside the parentheses of this nextInt function.
53

54
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:46,340
And it will try to generate whole numbers between 0 and whatever it is this number is minus 1. So let's
54

55
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,570
see it in practice.
55

56
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:55,430
We're using the random number generator that comes from our Dart maths library. And we're using a method
56

57
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,900
called nextInt
57

58
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:05,780
that comes from the random number generator. And we're providing a maximum value between these parentheses.
58

59
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:15,170
So if we put in a number of six, what numbers do you think will be generated by our random number generator?
59

60
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,730
Well we can always test it out,
60

61
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,030
right?
61

62
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,560
There's nothing mysterious in programming.
62

63
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,580
Let's copy our line of code and let's head over to dartpad. And inside our main function, let's paste
63

64
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:35,720
in our leftDiceNumber. And let's add our int to create this new leftDiceNumber.
64

65
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,220
And of course, we need to import our Dart maths library.
65

66
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,790
Now we have pretty much the same conditions.
66

67
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,170
We have our Dart maths library imported,
67

68
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:55,420
so we can use our random number generator. And we've created this new variable called leftDiceNumber.
68

69
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,160
We've set it it's equal the random number generator using that nextInt method.
69

70
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,800
So now all we have to do is just to print out our leftDiceNumber into the console, and we click run
70

71
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,460
a couple of times just to see what it'll print out.
71

72
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,070
So we get 5. 1. 3.
72

73
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:26,740
And if you do this long enough, you'll realize that we'll get numbers between zero to six minus one.
73

74
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,830
So whatever we provide in here minus 1, which is 5.
74

75
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,130
So we'll get all the numbers between 0 and 5.
75

76
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,580
So it could be any of those numbers.
76

77
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:44,240
Now in our case, we can't actually have zero because we don't actually have an image called dice0.
77

78
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:53,580
And if you run this a few times and you click on the button, eventually the image will disappear because
78

79
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,640
it doesn't have a dice0.png.
79

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,130
Now what can we do to change that range from 0 - 5, to 1 - 6?
80

81
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,800
Well we just add one to this.
81

82
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,490
If it's gonna be a zero, it turns into one. If it's gonna be a five, it turns into six.
82

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:26,330
So now we can hit save and safely click on a button, and we will never get an empty image ever again.
83

84
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:35,480
So now in our flat button, when it detects a press, it will update the state of the screen to change all
84

85
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:43,280
the places that use leftDiceNumber to use this new value that we've generated using our random generator
85

86
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,150
which comes from our Dart maths library.
86

87
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,690
If only learning maths in real life was as simple as importing a maths library into your brain, right?
87

88
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,990
But in this lesson, we've looked at how we can use that library and the random number generator.
88

89
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,690
Now I have a challenge for you.
89

90
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,050
I want you to be able to do the same thing that we've done for the left dice, but for the right dice.
90

91
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,510
Because at the moment, it doesn't do anything when I click on it. And I want it to have the same behavior
91

92
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,720
of changing the number when I click on it,
92

93
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,200
just like this one. Once you are ready, pause the video and try to complete the challenge. In the next lesson,
93

94
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,490
I'll show you the solution.
