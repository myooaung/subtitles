00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,750
In the past few lessons we've set up already
1

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,200
most of our user interface. We've got the background layouts, we've got pretty much all of the column
2

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,880
structure setup and we've also got our list view. But now we need to look at the second part of our mockup
3

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,900
and we need to create this little pop up thing that comes up from the bottom to allow our user to add
4

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,360
any new to do list tasks.
5

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,560
Now if we head over to the Flutter docs and if we take a look at the very bottom, our widget index, and you
6

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,360
can scroll through and you might come across something called a bottom sheet.
7

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,550
So bottom sheets slide up from the bottom to reveal more content.
8

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,500
That sounds pretty much like exactly what we want right?
9

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,290
So let's click on it to read a little bit more.
10

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,500
And it tells us that there's two kinds of bottom sheets: one which is persistent, so something that shows
11

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,950
information that supplements the primary content.
12

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,370
So a little bit of extra content but it stays visible even when the user interacts with other parts
13

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,880
of the app.
14

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,100
So that's probably not what we want.
15

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,230
We don't want it to stay there all the time
16

17
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,570
right?
17

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,600
So instead, what we want is a modal bottom sheet which is something that prevents the user from interacting
18

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,790
with the rest of the app because it's going to be highlighted and it's going to come up as a little
19

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,210
pop up where the user can type in their new task and then once they're done, it can pop away
20

21
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,050
and for us to go back to the main user interface. So the way that we create these modal bottom sheets
21

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,610
is with something called a showModalBottomSheet function.
22

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,650
So let's click on it to find out a bit more.
23

24
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,050
You can see that this function has two required properties.
24

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:58,680
It needs to take in the current context which allows it to look up the navigator in the theme to see
25

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,560
how it should lay out this bottom sheet to be consistent with the rest of your app and also it needs
26

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,550
a builder,
27

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:14,670
so a widget builder. And a widget builder is simply a function that takes the current context and returns
28

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,780
a widget.
29

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,590
And in this case, it's going to be returning a bottom sheet widget.
30

31
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,770
So let's see how we can implement it.
31

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,480
So if we head back into our onPressed,
32

33
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,810
well this is the part that should trigger that bottom sheet to pop up.
33

34
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,920
So let's call our showModalBottomSheet.
34

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,100
Now notice, you have to be careful there's a showBottomSheet which shows the persistent type, but the
35

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,570
one that we want is actually the little pop up that comes up with an animation as well.
36

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,160
So the context that  we're going to pass in is of course the current context of our widget from our task
37

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,150
screen.
38

39
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,290
So in our case, it's actually not all that much that's going to be passed over because we don't have
39

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,250
much in the theme
40

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,210
but we do have a navigation stack. So we can tell it where it is in that navigation stack.
41

42
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:13,260
But we've also got this builder method and you can see that this thing wants a function to be passed
42

43
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,740
in.
43

44
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,970
So let's create a function up here. And this function
44

45
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,650
if you remember has to return a widget and have a context as an input.
45

46
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:33,620
So notice how this is actually really similar to our build method that we've been using all the time.
46

47
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,660
So the output is a widget. And let's give the method a name
47

48
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:49,950
so buildBottomSheet and then it takes an input which is of type build context and we can call it context
48

49
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,950
and then it's got a return a widget.
49

50
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,770
So in this case, it's going to return whatever we want to show inside our bottom sheet.
50

51
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,140
So what do we want to show?
51

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,720
Well let's say that we just return a container showing just a really simple thing.
52

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,940
And of course make sure that you can actually spell unlike me, hope you got Widget instead of Wiget.
53

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,470
So now inside our builder, we can pass in this method that we've just created which is called Build
54

55
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,030
BottomSheet.
55

56
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,670
And if we go ahead and add a semicolon, then we've now set up our showModalBottomSheet.
56

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,370
And it's pretty short actually if you just look at it.
57

58
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,240
But now when we press on the button, that's the moment of truth, and we get a bottom sheet that pops up
58

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,820
from the bottom and builds a container widget to show us.
59

60
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,340
Now how can I be sure that we've got actually our container?
60

61
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,790
Well let's give it some text, shall we?
61

62
00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:03,260
Let's give it a centered text which is going to be, 'This is a bottom sheet'. Let's hit save.
62

63
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:10,490
And you can see we've now got access to this bottom sheet area that we can put whatever content we want.
63

64
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,520
And you can see how it darkens the rest of the user interface so we can't interact with the rest of it.
64

65
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,560
But as soon as we click away, then it animates and drops down to the bottom. And then it animates up, animators
65

66
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,240
down.
66

67
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,910
I could play with this all day, but I won't for your sanity.
67

68
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,670
So now that we know how we can create these bottom sheets, that's delete the little bit of dummy content
68

69
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:40,910
that we've got in there and let's go ahead and create some real content.
69

70
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,140
Notice how we could have this very wordy method here,
70

71
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,590
buildBottomSheet with a name and also have a return.
71

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,840
But we know that when we just want to return one thing,
72

73
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,370
so a single line item in this case a container, we can actually delete the semicolon,
73

74
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:08,670
delete the return keyword as well as all of the curly brackets and replace it with our arrow function.
74

75
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,860
Now we have a single line code right here.
75

76
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,930
We can make this even shorter by instead of having a named function buildBottomSheet,
76

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,880
we can just make it an anonymous function.
77

78
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:31,070
So let's go ahead and take all of this part and we're going to cut it and replace the function here
78

79
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,520
with what we had before.
79

80
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,770
So now we can delete the name and the return type
80

81
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,880
and of course this context input also doesn't need the type here either.
81

82
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,410
It can infer it from the context that we pass in from over here which is a build context type.
82

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,220
So now our code is very very short, painfully short almost.
83

84
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,360
But the functionality is still exactly the same.
84

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,410
And instead of creating a container and building out a massive tree over here, I'm actually going to
85

86
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,570
take this and create a brand new file inside our screens.
86

87
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:17,570
So let's create a new Dart file called the add_task_screen.
87

88
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,850
And here we're going to create the widget tree for what we want to see inside this little bottom sheet.
88

89
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:37,140
So instead of returning a container, I'm going to return a AddTaskScreen and I'm also going to import
89

90
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,230
my screens folder and the add_task_screen.dart file.
90

91
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,080
So now let's go over here and actually create something called AddTaskScreen
91

92
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,270
and inside this screen what do we want to have?
92

93
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,960
Well if we take a look at our mockup, you can see that we want to have maybe a title, so a bit of a text
93

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,700
widget and then a text input, something where the user can write the actual task, and then we can
94

95
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:15,870
just have a flat button that says add. But before we create all of this interface, there's just one thing
95

96
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,010
that's very obviously different. Namely in our mockup
96

97
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:27,390
we wanted to have curved edges for this bottom sheet similar to how we've got our list to make our app
97

98
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,280
look really consistent in its design.
98

99
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:37,440
But at the moment we've got this very square looking bottom sheet. Even though it's very cool, it's still
99

100
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,510
not exactly what we wanted.
100

101
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,460
So let's look at how we can create this.
101

102
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,360
Well we've got our container
102

103
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:52,590
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to give it a color that is going to be exactly the same as this
103

104
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,170
background color. On a Mac
104

105
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,740
there's something called a digital color meter.
105

106
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,520
And what it allows me to do is basically it gives me a  color dropper and you can install similar color
106

107
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,690
dropper tools on Windows as well.
107

108
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:17,360
And I'm going to hover over here and see what the value for this color is. So at the moment it seems
108

109
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,060
like it's something like 117 right?
109

110
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,970
So red is 117 , green is 117 and B is 117 .
110

111
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:34,520
So now with these values I'm gonna go into chrome and I'm going to search for 'rgb to hex'. And you end
111

112
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,730
up with this little color picker tool in Chrome where you can change the values of these things. So we
112

113
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,360
had 117, 117 and 117.
113

114
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:54,740
So it's this gray color and the hex code is right here which is kind of #757575.
114

115
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,770
So let's go ahead and copy this over to our code.
115

116
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:06,920
So the color is going to be constructed using the color widget and it takes an integer value.
116

117
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:17,030
So if you remember from before, we had to do the 0xff to replace the hash tag with a pound sign and
117

118
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,810
then we end up with the integer value of our color.
118

119
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,890
So now if we hit save, you'll notice that this thing that pops up is now pretty much indistinguishable
119

120
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,550
from the background.
120

121
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:38,600
So we're going to use that as the first container and then inside this container, I'm going to add another
121

122
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,150
container.
122

123
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,290
Now bear with me, this seems a little bit weird
123

124
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,780
what I'm doing but it's kind of become clear very soon.
124

125
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,490
Now in this container, I'm going to add some decoration.
125

126
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,050
It's gonna be a box decoration and the color is just going to be a white color.
126

127
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,910
And then of course we have our border radius.
127

128
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:11,690
So now we can add a border radius with the top left and top right with a 20 circular radius for both.
128

129
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:19,520
And now if I hit save, you'll see that when this bottom sheet pops up, there's actually one bottom sheet
129

130
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,340
at the back which has that gray color that matches with the background.
130

131
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,410
And then there is another one inside that container which has the rounded edges.
131

132
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,480
So this allows us to have this little curved edge bottom sheet
132

133
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,730
and it looks really neat because it fits in with the rest of our design.
133

134
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,060
So now all we need to do is to add in the rest of the things that we see in our mockup.
134

135
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:54,400
So we've got a large-ish title that says 'Add task', a text field and a flat button.
135

136
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:03,230
So here's another challenge for you. Pause the video and see if you can recreate this exact layout using what
136

137
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,630
you've learned about widgets and laying out UI using Flutter widgets.
137

138
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,340
And once you're done, once you've given it a go, then come back and I'll show you my solution.
138

139
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,640
So pause video now.
139

140
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,190
All right.
140

141
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,150
So how did that go?
141

142
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,470
Well here's my version of how you could do this.
142

143
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,570
And there's a million ways of doing the same thing as always with Flutter.
143

144
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:32,230
So just because yours is different from my code doesn't mean that you got it wrong. As long as you get
144

145
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,950
this end result then you've pretty much achieved the objective. Inside our container
145

146
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:47,470
I'm going to add a child which is going to be a column because again everything is laid out vertically
146

147
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,450
one and top of the other.
147

148
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,200
And in this column it's going to have some children the first of which is going to be a text widget,
148

149
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,990
the second is going to be a text field widget
149

150
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,280
and the final one is going to be a flat button widget.
150

151
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:12,530
So now I've got three things and I'm going to give my text widget the name of 'Add task'.
151

152
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,200
So now when I hit save you can see my three widgets show up.
152

153
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,820
They all look really ugly but we're going to change it right now.
153

154
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,210
So, firstly the text widget. Let's add some style to it.
154

155
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:37,210
So let's add a style property which is going to be text style and I'm going to change the font size
155

156
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:46,060
to make it a lot bigger, to make it maybe 30. And then I'm going to change the color to make it our favorite
156

157
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,480
color
157

158
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,580
in this module anyways, the colors.lightBlueAccent and now it looks a bit better.
158

159
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,490
So onwards.
159

160
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:05,890
Next is our text field. And our text field is actually encompassing the whole length of this because when
160

161
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:13,720
I click on it, you can see the blue underline show up and the cursor is almost invisible at the very
161

162
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,170
left.
162

163
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:21,400
Now the other thing I want to change is when I pop up this little bottom screen, I want this text field
163

164
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:28,660
to be automatically already enabled because you can see that if I hold COMMAND + K to bring up my keyboard
164

165
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:36,520
or on Android you would toggle this little button right here, and I want it to automatically show up
165

166
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,940
this keyboard whenever it pops up so that I don't have to click on it. Given that there's only one text
166

167
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,420
field
167

168
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,850
it makes sense for us to automatically enable this text field so that they can start typing straight
168

169
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:55,100
away without having to have the extra step of tapping on this. And to do this
169

170
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,850
I'm going to add the autofocus property and I'm going to set it to true.
170

171
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,650
So now if I hit save and we open up our bottom sheet, you'll see that it's automatically enabled, this
171

172
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,600
bottom line is blue and our keyboard pops up every single time.
172

173
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,380
The other thing I want to do is to address the fact that are cursor is pretty much off the screen. And I
173

174
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:28,120
can bring it to the middle by simply changing the text align property to TextAlign.center.
174

175
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:34,090
And now you can see when I pressed the add button, the cursor shows up right in the middle and it's already
175

176
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,050
enabled and ready to go.
176

177
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,280
The final one is of course our flat button.
177

178
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,700
So let's give it some text by giving it a child which is a text widget and it's just going to read 'Add'.
178

179
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,250
And then I want to give it a color which is going to be the light blue accent.
179

180
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,440
But when I hit save and hot reload, you don't actually see it show up.
180

181
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,190
And the reason is because our flat button is currently giving us a warning namely that the parameter
181

182
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,370
onPressed is required.
182

183
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:14,330
And when the onPressed is not supplied for a button, then it default to a disabled button.
183

184
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,550
So the color isn't showing up because our button currently is disabled.
184

185
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,800
So let's go ahead and add the onPressed that it requires and here at a later date, we'll probably add
185

186
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,480
some code
186

187
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,370
so that we'll add our task to the list.
187

188
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,220
But right now I'm just going to leave it as it is. But as soon as I hit save and once we've got our on
188

189
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:44,540
Pressed and our flat button is not disabled anymore, you can see our background show up. And now I want
189

190
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,100
to fix that text.
190

191
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,700
So let's change the style to make it white,
191

192
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:56,670
and so text style and the color is colors.white.
192

193
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,990
All right so now let's hit save and the final thing that you'll notice is different between that one
193

194
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,720
and the mockup is this button goes edge to edge right?
194

195
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,460
Or pretty much the same width as the text field.
195

196
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,600
So how do we do that in our code?
196

197
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:25,700
Well we can change our column cross axis alignment to make it stretch from side to side and then let's
197

198
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,910
go ahead and change the text widget's
198

199
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,890
textAlign property to center as well.
199

200
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,150
Now notice the first property of text has to be 'Add Task'.
200

201
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:44,180
So if you try and add another property in front of it, it's not going to like that very much because
201

202
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:53,640
this doesn't have a parameter name. It doesn't have something like text widget with text something colon...
202

203
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,640
So it needs that positional data and its position must be the first in the widget.
203

204
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,910
So we have to let it be first.
204

205
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,090
And we have to treat it with extra special care.
205

206
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:14,180
So now that we've pretty much created everything that we have here, all we have to do is add some padding
206

207
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,030
around our column.
207

208
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:23,760
So let's go ahead and add some padding into our container right here which wraps our column.
208

209
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:33,350
And I would say that we could probably get away with simply just adding maybe all sides and let's add
209

210
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:41,580
good old 20 pixels and it looks pretty much like what we see over here.
210

211
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,170
Now you can of course add some padding between this field and add button if you wish but I think at
211

212
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,450
the moment that actually looks fine.
212

213
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,030
But of course feel free to modify the appearance as you like.
213

214
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,850
So now we have pretty much replicated our entire mockup.
214

215
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,290
We've got our area at the top which describes our list,
215

216
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,990
we've got our actual list view with some list items,
216

217
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:17,180
we've got a pop up an animated bottom sheet and we've now got everything inside that screen show laid
217

218
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,980
out as well.
218

219
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,750
So now we're pretty much ready to move on to the next stage where we look at how we make it all work
219

220
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,360
and make it all come together.
220

221
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,370
And the first thing I want to address is why is it that our checkboxes don't work?
221

222
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,400
So have a think about that and to find out the solution,
222

223
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,590
I'll see you on the next lesson.
