All right guys.
1

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,380
So now that all of the tutorial parts of this module have been covered, it's time for the boss level
2

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,790
challenge.
3

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,460
And in this challenge, we're going to be using what we learned in previous modules to build out the functionality
4

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,130
of our app so that we can actually get real time data for the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Lite 
5

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,910
coins to give our app its full functionality.
6

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,070
And we're going to be using the API provided by coinapi.io
7

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,760
So if you head over to this web address and take a look at their API docs, you'll see that they can provide
8

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,310
a whole bunch of data on a lot of different coins.
9

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,290
But what we're mostly interested in is the exchange rates.
10

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,130
So get into REST API, exchange rates, you can see that the way that you would be able to get the price
11

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,970
of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency that they provide has a URL that looks something like this.
12

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,290
So you have the base URL up to here and then you have the cryptocurrency identifier.
13

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,920
And then after a forward flash you have the fiat currencies such as US dollars or pounds sterling or
14

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,090
euros.
15

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,400
And this will give you back a piece of JSON data that look something like this where you can tap
16

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,030
into this rate object and get hold of the current value,
17

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,340
say for example in this case the price of Bitcoins in US dollars.
18

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,860
But that's not it.
19

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,470
We also have to provide a way of authenticating ourselves,
20

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,810
so an API key, just like what we did in the Clima app when we worked with the Open Weather Map API.
21

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,440
So in order to get hold of an API key, you have to head over to coinapi.io/pricing and we're
22

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,520
just gonna go for the free one which limits us to 100 daily requests,
23

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,730
but that's more than enough to complete our challenge.
24

25
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:01,350
So now if you click on get an API key fill in your email and your name, the title you can leave as student
25

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,510
and company size leave as one to 10. And then click on get a free API key. And then go into the email
26

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:17,370
that you typed in and you should find an email from coinapi.io giving you access to your API key.
27

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,480
So then the final URL that you're looking at will look something like this.
28

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,080
So it's rest.coinapi.io/, version 1, v1/ exchange rate / the cryptocurrency and then
29

30
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,630
/ the fiat currency and all of these symbols are already listed in the starting projects so you
30

31
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,220
don't have to worry about that.
31

32
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,280
And then at the end of the URL, we can tag on the API key just like what we did with the parameters in
32

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:52,020
the Open Weather Map API. And then we can set it equal to the API that they sent us through email. Like
33

34
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,140
this.
34

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,000
And now when I go ahead and hit enter, you can see it gives me back that data and the current price of
35

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,810
Bitcoin in U.S. dollars. And this works for of course any other currency. So say if we wanted to know
36

37
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,610
it in euros or if we wanted to know the price of Ethereum,
37

38
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,930
so this is going to be the URL that you're going to be working with in order to complete this challenge.
38

39
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,120
Now the challenge is split into three parts and it's labeled bronze, silver and gold.
39

40
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,840
So the idea is that you would go through each of the levels of the challenge and depending on where
40

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,180
you get up to without having to look at the solution code,
41

42
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,600
well that's the medal you're going to get. But each of the levels have to happen sequentially.
42

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,540
So we first start with the bronze level where you're simply going to fetch the current price of bitcoins
43

44
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,160
in US dollars.
44

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,490
So that's all the app is going to be able to do, just fetch one price for one cryptocurrency.
45

46
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,850
Now if you manage to do that without much issue and you're able to level up to the silver level, then
46

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,710
in this case you're going to be able to use that scroll wheel that we implemented previously, or on Android
47

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,070
it will be the dropdown, and select a currency or any currency and be able to get the value of bitcoin
48

49
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:22,070
in that currency on the go. And if you want to challenge yourself even further then aim for the gold
49

50
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,200
level where we implement all of the functionality for our app and we add in
50

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,980
prices for bitcoins, ethereum and lite coin. And you can scroll through or pick various currencies from
51

52
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,920
the dropdown to see the prices of all of these crypto currencies in the selected fiat currency.
52

53
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:47,210
So it's a really fun challenge and it's going to test you a lot on things that you've learned in previous
53

54
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,130
modules and previous lessons.
54

55
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,390
And remember that if you get stuck, your first protocol should be Stack Overflow,
55

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:01,730
Google, Flutter documentation and it's only if you're really really stuck and you really can't move forward,
56

57
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,880
then take a look at the solution code which is thoroughly commented and will take you line by line through
57

58
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
the solution.
58

59
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,530
So I hope you're ready to take on this challenge. Head over to the next lesson and get started.
