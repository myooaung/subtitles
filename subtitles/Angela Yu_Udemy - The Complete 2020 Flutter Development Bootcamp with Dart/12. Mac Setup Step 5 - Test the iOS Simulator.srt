00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,200
Now that you're all done with installing Xcode, setting it up and agreeing to all of the license agreements,
1

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:15,260
we're now ready to create our first Flutter app and test it on the iOS simulator.
2

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,860
Now when you install Xcode, another application gets installed by default and that is the iOS simulator.
3

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,830
So you can search for it in spotlight, and you can simply launch it by clicking on it.
4

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,140
Now by default, when the simulator first launches, it'll take a while to set itself up.
5

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,450
It's almost like you're switching on your phone for the first time.
6

7
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,380
If the simulator that shows up on your screen is way too large because it's trying to displayed all
7

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,070
the pixels,
8

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,900
so if you want to make it a little bit smaller, you can simply just hover towards the edge until you
9

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,910
see little toggle and you can make it as small or as large as you want.
10

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,850
Now, it's quite hard to re-position the simulator I find.
11

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,820
But you have to sort of click somewhere around the edge, or the most surefire way is actually clicking
12

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,430
on this label where it says iPhone XR.
13

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,990
That usually allows you to move it around and you can resize it as necessary.
14

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,810
So now that our simulator has launched, we are ready to try and test it by running a brand new Flutter
15

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,760
app onto it.
16

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,490
So you should still have your testing app lying around somewhere. If it's not open and Android Studio,
17

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,590
simply go to file and open recent or simply go to open and locate the folder that contains the project
18

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,120
and hit open.
19

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:45,370
So once you're here, in order to run it onto the iOS simulator, all that we have to do is change the device.
20

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,890
So right here at the moment, I've got my Android emulator selected, and if I click on the drop down list,
21

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,040
you can see that I've got my simulator in here as well.
22

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,300
So let's select that instead.
23

24
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:03,910
And now if I click Run, I will be able to run my app simultaneously on the android emulator as well as
24

25
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:12,330
the iOS simulator. And you can again watch all the steps that it's going through to be able to do this.
25

26
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,660
I find it pretty magical how Flutter is doing all of this behind the scenes for you, but you do have
26

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,660
to wait a little while and once it's done, the next time when we run it or when we test it,
27

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,920
it'll be so much faster.
28

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,180
So now that it's complete, I've now got my app installed both on the Android emulator and the simulator,
29

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,870
and they both work just perfectly.
30

31
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,740
So you can see that at the moment I've got two apps running because there's a two right there.
31

32
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,550
And if you want to stop it, when you click on the stop sign, you can see that there's all of these processes
32

33
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,240
and you can click on stop all, to stop all of our apps from running.
33

34
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:00,470
So that's all it is. You've successfully setup everything to finally be able to create Flutter apps and
34

35
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,450
run it on iOS and Android.
35

36
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,410
Give yourself a pat on the back because that was a long setup process but you are now ready to get started
36

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,210
and build your very first Flutter app.
37

38
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,310
So once you're ready, head over to the next module and we'll get started.
