00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.460
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.290
So for those of you guys who have a physical iPhone device or an iPad device even, and you would like
2

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.240
to run the Flutter apps that you create onto your physical iOS device, then you are in the right place.
3

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.940
That's exactly what we're going to cover in this lesson.
4

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
Now, before we can get started there's a couple of prerequisites that you have to fulfill before you
5

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.520
can actually do this.
6

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.970
One is you must have an Apple I.D. So you must have registered with Apple at some point, giving them your
7

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.320
email and have a password.
8

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.300
Now this Apple I.D. doesn't have to be a developer account.
9

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.880
So it could be any sort of Apple account that you have. Anyone that you use to say download apps from
10

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.060
the App Store, or the ones that you use to log in on your iPhone.
11

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.440
Now the next thing you need is a iPhone or an iPad device.
12

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.940
Our apps are not going to run onto a watch or any other type of Apple device. It has to be something
13

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.140
that can run iOS.
14

15
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.410
So one of these two. And then three, you're going to need Xcode already installed, which we already did
15

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.100
previously in the setup instructions. If you haven't done that, then you'll need to do that now before
16

17
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.750
we can continue.
17

18
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.540
And finally, you're going to need a good quality USB cable.
18

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.530
And strangely enough, we've discovered through years of teaching students that USB cables are not created
19

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.300
equal.
20

21
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.710
And some of them will only transfer data whereas other ones will only transfer power,
21

22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.560
and you need both power and data.
22

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.380
So best case scenario, you have the original cable that you got from Apple, which is hopefully not yet
23

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.990
frayed because they tend to do that. Or you have a good quality USB cable from another provider.
24

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.910
Once you've got all of these four things, then we're ready to move on.
25

26
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.560
And just a word of warning,
26

27
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.450
there's quite a few steps that we have to go through, and they're kind of like the hoops that you have
27

28
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.980
to jump through before Apple will actually allow us to install our app onto our phone.
28

29
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.310
And as you can imagine, Apple is very serious about security.
29

30
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.940
So there's about 10 steps that we have to go through. But I will go through each of them with you, together
30

31
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.720
step by step.
31

32
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.730
So the first step is you have to make sure that the iOS version on your physical device is compatible
32

33
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.900
with the Xcode version.
33

34
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.880
Now generally speaking, the Xcode version is two versions behind iOS.
34

35
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.390
What does that mean?
35

36
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.970
So here I have my Xcode application open, and you can see that the version that's registered on it
36

37
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.160
is currently 10.2.1.
37

38
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.520
Now on the right hand side here, I've got quick time that's rendering my current iPhone.
38

39
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.230
And if I go into settings, and I go into general and about, then you can see that the current software
39

40
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.770
version I'm running is 12.2. The number that we're interested in is that, if you have an iOS version
40

41
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.820
of say 12, then minus 2 becomes 10.
41

42
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.990
So Xcode has to be at least version 10 in the first number.
42

43
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.950
Now the second number has to be lower on the iPhone.
43

44
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.960
So if this is a 2, this has to be a minimum of 2.
44

45
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.150
So if I had Xcode 10.3, 10.4 etc. that will also work with this version of
45

46
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.630
iOS.
46

47
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.460
But basically, your Xcode has to be ahead of, or equal to your iOS software version.
47

48
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.130
And there's a gap of 2 on that major number.
48

49
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.540
So 10 matches with 12. 11 would match with 13.
49

50
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.950
Eventually when Apple releases iOS 13.
50

51
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:45.270
But if your Xcode is too old, or it doesn't match with the iOS version, then the easiest way is to
51

52
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.640
update Xcode to the latest version.
52

53
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.780
So open up the app store and update it there.
53

54
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.640
It is very hard to go back in time for your iOS version.
54

55
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.060
It's much much easier to upgrade Xcode to the latest version.
55

56
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.680
Now however, some of the latest versions of Xcode will require you having the latest version of Mac OS.
56

57
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.720
So if you go into this little Apple sign and you click on About this Mac, you have to make sure that
57

58
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.810
you're running Mac OS Mojave to be able to run the latest version of Xcode.
58

59
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.970
So if you have one of these things that are a bit older, then you might end up initiating a chain of
59

60
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.260
updates where you first update your Mac OS and then you update your Xcode. So you go onto the app store
60

61
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.990
and you can see that there is a later version of Xcode but it's not letting you update,
61

62
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.640
then the reason might be because you have a older version of Mac OS. Because there are minimum requirements
62

63
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.730
on all of these pieces of software.
63

64
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.100
So you can see here, we need at least Mac OS 14.3 or later. Which is exactly what I have,
64

65
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.600
I actually have a later version of Mac OS.
65

66
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.770
But once you're done with that and you've made sure that your Xcode is compact with your iOS version,
66

67
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.140
then we can move on to the next step, which is to install homebrew.
67

68
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.910
Now we're going to do this by following the tutorial on the Flutter docs page.
68

69
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.860
So under install, when we go to the Mac option and we go to deploy to iOS devices, you can see that
69

70
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.610
there are detailed step by step instructions.
70

71
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.960
Now there's a couple of bits missing here that I think are really important which is why I'm walking
71

72
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.220
you through it in video format, but there's a couple of other things that we definitely have to do.
72

73
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.960
And the first thing is to install homebrew.
73

74
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.300
So if you click on this link right here, it'll take you to brew.sh and on this page it will show
74

75
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.520
you how to install homebrew.
75

76
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:51.590
So all we have to do is to copy this line in its entirety, so we hit COMMAND + C to copy.
76

77
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.930
And then we're going to launch terminal.
77

78
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.540
So if you go into this upper right corner and click on the magnifying glass, you'll launch Spotlight
78

79
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.260
and then we're going to search for something called a terminal, and we can hit ENTER 
79

80
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.770
once it finds it to launch our terminal application. Now once terminal has launched, then you're going
80

81
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.420
to paste that command you copied over, and you get to hit ENTER to install homebrew. And you can leave
81

82
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.590
it running for as long as it takes. And then go ahead and hit ENTER to continue.
82

83
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.490
And it's going to ask you for your password.
83

84
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.170
Now the password it wants, is the one that you use to log into your Mac. And your user account on
84

85
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.050
your Mac that you're currently logged into, has to be one with Admin privileges. Because it's going to
85

86
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.760
be installing homebrew onto the computer for all users to use.
86

87
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.040
So I'm going to type in my password and notice that it doesn't actually show what I'm typing, so you're
87

88
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.250
typing blind.
88

89
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.570
And, if you get it wrong, it'll just tell you so you can try again.
89

90
00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.600
But once you're done, hit ENTER, and it will continue installing homebrew.
90

91
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.810
Now you'll know it's done because they'll tell you installation successful, and you will also be able
91

92
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.910
to see your prompt which is your user name and also the $.
92

93
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:18.330
So now that we're done with installing homebrew, we're going to be using homebrew to do a couple of things
93

94
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:26.520
that Flutter will require to be able to run your app onto iOS. Here under Step 3, in deploy to iOS devices,
94

95
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.730
you're going to copy each of these instructions one by one and you're going to paste it into the terminal.
95

96
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.230
Right here, and then we're going to hit ENTER. Now, as it says here,
96

97
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:47.130
the first two steps here is because, Flutter is currently using a opensource package which is developed
97

98
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:53.670
by an external developer, and these two steps may go away at some point in the future.
98

99
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.460
So maybe when you're looking at this page sometime down in the future, you might not see these two instructions,
99

100
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.740
in which case, you don't need to do it anymore.
100

101
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.420
So this is just a quick heads up.
101

102
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.420
But as of right now it is still an essential step if you want everything to work.
102

103
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.170
So once you've done that step, then you're going to go and do the next step and you're basically going
103

104
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:24.120
to go through this one by one, until you get to the very bottom. And they will take different amounts
104

105
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:31.110
of time to complete, but you will always know once it's done by seeing your prompt and then you know
105

106
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.530
that it's time to add the next line of code from the Flutter website.
106

107
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.880
And when you get to this line where it says 'brew install', all of these things, 'idevice installer  ios-
107

108
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.170
deploy cocoapods.
108

109
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.750
This is the one that's going to take the longest basically.
109

110
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.090
So, this is one where you have to be really patient.
110

111
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:59.370
So once that's all done, we're going to copy the very last line which is to set up something called cocoa
111

112
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.630
pods, and this will take a little while as well.
112

113
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:11.430
Now once that's complete, you should see 'Setup completed' and we're now done with Step 3, and all of this.
113

114
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:22.550
So we're now ready to move on, where we open up Xcode, and we add our Apple I.D. So in order to do this,
114

115
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:28.220
you're going to go into Android Studio, and you should have the 'I Am Rich' project already open.
115

116
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.330
If not, go ahead and open it from file, open or open recent.
116

117
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.190
You might see it in there as well.
117

118
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.620
And once you're here, you're going to locate the iOS folder in your project navigator.
118

119
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.080
So if you're in a different view, say the Android view etc. then make sure you're inside the project
119

120
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:53.750
view. And you're going to right click on the iOS folder, and go to Flutter, then open iOS module in 
120

121
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.460
Xcode.
121

122
00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:00.770
And this should automatically open up Xcode, and open up the runner project which contains all of
122

123
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.650
the iOS part of our 'I Am Rich' app. Now,
123

124
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.310
if that doesn't work for you, then you can also go ahead and right click on this iOS folder, and click
124

125
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.490
on 'Reveal in finder' and once you're here, you should be able to expand that folder,
125

126
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:26.080
and here, you can simply double click on the runner.xcworkspace to be able to launch it inside 
126

127
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.110
Xcode.
127

128
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:36.080
Now, once you hear, you're going to click on the runner project. So it's the one that has the blue icon.
128

129
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.100
And now you're going to be adding an account.
129

130
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:47.410
So here where it says team, if you have never developed an iOS app before, you will have to add your Apple
130

131
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.520
I.D. here.
131

132
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.010
So here you're going to put in your e-mail that you use to logon to Apple, and then it's going to prompt
132

133
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.960
you for your password.
133

134
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:03.090
Now once you've successfully logged in with your Apple I.D. then you should now be able to go into the
134

135
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.620
team selector and select the account that you've just added.
135

136
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.970
Now because mine is a developer account, it will show up with our company name.
136

137
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.430
But in your case it should probably be your name, or the email that you use to log in.
137

138
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:27.050
So now we're finally ready to connect your phone with USB. So hook up your phone to your Mac.
138

139
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.720
And at this moment in time, you'll probably get a popup that ask you whether if you trust this computer
139

140
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.830
that you connected your phone to. The popup should look something like this.
140

141
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:43.530
And even though we're always used to clicking on the right hand side and and always the bolded words,
141

142
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.190
be sure that you click on 'Trust' over here instead.
142

143
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.110
Be careful that you actually click on the right one.
143

144
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.510
Now if you accidentally clicked on the one on the right, then be sure to unplug your phone and re-plug
144

145
00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.820
it to hopefully read trigger these popup, and trust it.
145

146
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.530
Now there's one more thing that we have to trust, which is our development certificates. So it's the
146

147
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:14.990
Apple I.D. that we added just now in Xcode. And the easiest way to get this to trigger, is to actually
147

148
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.990
click Run inside Xcode to try and run it on to your physical devices.
148

149
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.200
If your device that's currently connected is not showing up right here,
149

150
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.930
make sure that the team is selected, and make sure that you've had a look inside this drop down and you've
150

151
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.990
been able to select the device.
151

152
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.610
Now you can click Run, and after you run it from Xcode,
152

153
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:43.340
If your app doesn't automatically launch on your iPhone, then it's time to go into your settings, go under
153

154
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:52.040
general, and then try and find device management, to find your Apple I.D. and then click on 'trust' to trust
154

155
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:59.390
your developer I.D. And once that's done, you should be able to come back to Xcode, run it again and
155

156
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.410
it should now go through without a problem.
156

157
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:10.390
Now the final thing we have to do here in Xcode, is to create a unique bundle I.D. That means you have
157

158
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:17.260
to make sure you've got the Runner app selected, you're inside the targets of runner,
158

159
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.830
you've got general selected, and this is your bundle identifier.
159

160
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.810
So here we've got our domain here appbrewere.co reversed.
160

161
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:31.960
So usually what we tell students is to write com, and then write your name, and then it should have .
161

162
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.630
the name of the app.
162

163
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.490
And this,
163

164
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.910
hopefully nobody with your full name is trying to release an app called 'I Am Rich'
164

165
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.610
onto the app store. And this will work just fine.
165

166
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:48.730
Now if you don't have this unique, usually you'll have a little red warning around here, and it will not
166

167
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.760
let you run your app until you fix this.
167

168
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:59.770
So after all of those steps, we're finally ready to tackle the very last one, which is being able to
168

169
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.650
run your app from Android Studio.
169

170
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:09.910
So head back into Android Studio, and at this point before we try and run our app on our physical iPhone,
170

171
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.830
it's a good idea to run a final check just to make sure that everything is setup correctly.
171

172
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:21.430
For that, we will use our Flutter Doctor. The Flutter Doctor will let us know if there was anything we
172

173
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:27.420
missed during the setup process. So go into Tools, and then under Flutter, select Flutter
173

174
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:35.690
Doctor. And now it will run the Flutter Doctor diagnostics, and it'll show you what are the things that you've
174

175
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.510
completed,
175

176
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:43.940
what are the things that might still be yet incomplete, and if you see any of these points as a cross,
176

177
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:53.120
then it usually includes a link to a documentation on Flutter's docs to tell you how you can fix it. But
177

178
00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:01.010
now that I've got ticks all across the board, you should see your phone being listed inside this drop down
178

179
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:08.210
list, and from now on, every time it's plugged in, you'll see it show up as a potential deployment target,
179

180
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.520
so you'll be able to run your apps onto your phone, without ever having to do all of the setup that we
180

181
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.910
did before.
181

182
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:21.470
So with our device listed in the dropdown and no issues detected by the Flutter Doctor, we're finally
182

183
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:30.640
ready to hit play and run our app on our physical device. And now you can see that the app has been installed
183

184
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:37.990
onto my physical device, and it will launch automatically, without you having to click on the app icon.
184

185
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.340
And is actually quite important that you don't click on the app icon, because that will usually launch
185

186
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.870
the previous version of your app.
186

187
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:52.120
So just wait for Android Studio and Flutter to kickstart the app. And now I have my 'I Am Rich' app running
187

188
00:15:52.180 --> 00:16:00.530
on my physical iOS device. So there's quite a few steps involved in doing this and there's quite a few
188

189
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.490
places that students fall down on.
189

190
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:09.320
So we've compiled a list for you to troubleshoot any problems you have and just check that you've completed
190

191
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.790
all of the steps. So that we'll be in the course resources under this module.
191

192
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:19.060
And if you have any problems getting up to here, then be sure to check that out.
192

193
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.970
Now once you already, head over to the next module, and we're going to be building another app.
