00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.540
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.790
It's a new day,
2

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.880
and that means we're making a new app. In this module,
3

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.040
we're going to be making a dice rolling app. And the crucial thing that we're trying to learn here, is
4

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.490
how do you create apps that not only look good but actually also have functionality.,
5

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.390
So by the end of the module, we're going to have a super awesome dice rolling app, where when you click
6

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.810
on it it's going to change the dice face. So you'll be able to use this to settle any scores you have
7

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.890
in real life such as who has to take out the trash.
8

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.280
As with all of our projects, we're going to start off by using a starter project that we've provided
9

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.140
for you.
10

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.130
And the reason is because we've already loaded up the images, we've already hooked up the assets, so you
11

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.490
don't have to do all of that boring stuff again.
12

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.850
We'll assume that you know how to drag and drop and how to link up the assets and add app icons.
13

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.900
We're going to spend our time learning new things such as how to make the user interface actually update
14

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.210
when the user does something, such as clicking on a button.
15

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.240
Go ahead and click on the clone or download button for this repository.
16

17
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.310
And of course a link to this repository will be provided in the course resources for this lesson.
17

18
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.420
Let's go ahead and clone this onto our local system.
18

19
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.060
So I'm going to crack open Android Studio, and I'm going to check out my project from version control.
19

20
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.120
Select 'Check out project from version control' and then paste the URL that we copied from
20

21
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.930
earlier into this box here. And then we're going to go ahead and click on Clone.
21

22
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.890
Now, once that's done, we're going to select no for this popup.
22

23
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.370
And instead we're going to open up our project,
23

24
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.550
so it doesn't try to build us an Android project, but we actually open up a Flutter project. So let's
24

25
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.640
navigate to where we specified we'd saved it, which in my case was under the folder Android Studio project
25

26
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.850
which is the default setting, and then we're going to select the app that we just cloned dicee_flutter
26

27
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.980
and click open.
27

28
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.310
All right.
28

29
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.090
So as always, we're greeted by a whole bunch of errors.
29

30
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.460
First things first, let's click on 'Get dependencies' so that our project knows that this is a Flutter
30

31
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.340
project and we're using the material.dart library, and make sure that everything is all set up for
31

32
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.980
us ready to go.
32

33
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.480
And, just before we get started building our app, I just want to show you around the starting project.
33

34
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.840
So all that we've done, is we've incorporated an images folder inside here, and we've got a number of
34

35
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.410
dice images all the way from dice 1 to dice 6. And we're going to be using these images inside our app
35

36
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.690
to display them when the user presses a button or changes a dice face.
36

37
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.670
Now in the last lesson we talked about how to actually link up images and you've already done that twice
37

38
00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.140
now.
38

39
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.320
So we've already done this for you.
39

40
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.280
So if you check inside the pubspec.yaml folder, you can see that we've already added our assets
40

41
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.940
to Flutter, and we've really set it up with the images folder.
41

42
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.220
So everything inside this folder is already ready to go, and can be used anywhere within our project.
42

43
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.550
Now in each module, we're trying to teach you something new about Flutter.
43

44
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.150
Something that's important to developing Flutter apps. But in the challenges, we try the challenge you
44

45
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.680
and revisit some of the things that we taught you in the tutorials.
45

46
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.770
So if you're not yet comfortable with a lot of these things such as linking up the image assets or adding
46

47
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.440
an app icon, then really make sure that you do all the challenges, because that's where all the revision
47

48
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440
happens.
48

49
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.810
And in these teaching modules, we're going to try and keep it focused around one topic.
49

50
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.400
So now all you have to do, is go ahead and run at the starting app, just to see what it looks like.
50

51
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.340
And first thing you'd notice that we've already got the app icons added into the project, so you don't have to
51

52
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.660
do all of that again.
52

53
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.180
But as regarding the rest of the app, we haven't actually done very much at all.
53

54
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.340
All we have is simply a app bar, with the title that says Dicee, and both the app bar and the background
54

55
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.170
is red, and we're ready to actually get started changing up the body of our app.
55

56
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.700
So for all of that and more, I'll see on the next lesson.
