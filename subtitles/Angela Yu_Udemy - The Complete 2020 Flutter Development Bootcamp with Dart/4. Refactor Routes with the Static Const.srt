Now that we've talked all about routes and the static keyword in detail, let us finish off the work that
1

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,620
we started with the routes.
2

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,620
And I'd like to pose that to you as a challenge.
3

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,950
Can you create static IDs for all of the remaining screens and replace the strings in our main.
4

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,760
dart file
5

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,750
similar to how we've done it with the welcome screen? And as part 2 of the challenge,
6

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,380
I'd like you to take a closer look at the welcome screen.
7

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,200
Notice that there are two buttons. At the moment
8

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,570
the buttons do nothing.
9

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,170
But needless to say that the top button should send users to the log in screen and the other one should
10

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,710
send users to the registration screen.
11

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,580
As part 2 of this challenge, I'd like you to implement this functionality. Modify the code in the welcome_
12

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,990
screen.dart file so that when a user presses a button they can navigate to the corresponding screen.
13

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,370
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video to complete the challenge.
14

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,270
Ready?
15

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,580
Here's the solution.
16

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:06,320
So for time's sake, I'm going to simply use copy and paste and I'm going to create this one which is
17

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,540
going to be registration screen.
18

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,340
And then I've got one called log in screen.
19

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,640
And finally I've got my chat screen.
20

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,520
So now that I've created all my static const in my stateful widgets, I can now come back here and
21

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,710
modify all of these hardcoded strings to tap into the actual static property. So that now if I make
22

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,590
any typos, then I would get an error and Android Studio would tell me that it doesn't know what I'm
23

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:45,050
talking about and it would prompt me to fix my errors. So finally we have our chat screen
24

25
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,230
screen.id and now we're done.
25

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,040
We have our four routes defined.
26

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,690
The key is a string and those strings come from our static const that are associated with each of these
27

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,400
screens.
28

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:08,250
And our values are going to push a particular screen onto our navigation stack.
29

30
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,800
So now if we take a closer look at the welcome_screen
30

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,940
.dart file,
31

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,620
you can see that we've got two buttons here.
32

33
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:23,170
We've got one that says log in and another that says register. And when each of these buttons are pressed
33

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,290
we want to go to the respective screens.
34

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,730
Now we can use our named routes and static constants to implement the navigation functionality for our two
35

36
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:41,350
buttons on the welcome screen. All we need to do is remove our comments and instead tap into the navigator
36

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,490
and use our pushNamed method to push the current context to the routeName.
37

38
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,840
And remember previously we'd been typing hard coded strings in here which again creating more sources
38

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,230
of potential errors.
39

40
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,670
Well in this case, we're going to use our static properties.
40

41
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,130
So when this button,
41

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,480
the login button, is pressed we want to go to the log in screen.
42

43
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:14,020
And for this file to know about the log in screen, we of course have to import the log in screen. And
43

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,010
down here
44

45
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,900
we can now say LogInScreen.id to tap in to that static constant property.
45

46
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,790
And now when our log in button gets pressed,
46

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,030
then we should be pushing the log in screen onto the stack.
47

48
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:38,230
And when our registration button gets pressed, then we should be pushing our registration screen onto
48

49
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,100
the screen.
49

50
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,550
So let's import registration screen as well so that all code no longer has any errors,
50

51
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,100
and finally let's close that off with a semicolon.
51

52
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,180
So if we run our app now when I click on the log in button, it'll take me to a log in screen with the
52

53
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,450
log in button. And if I click on the register button, it'll take me to the registration screen.
53

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,630
So that's pretty cool.
54

55
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:11,200
We're using our static constants in order to make our code a little bit safer in this case and also
55

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,250
do it in the most efficient way possible.
56

57
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,280
Now just a word of warning here that when you created your named routes, if you followed the style that
57

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:30,700
we saw on the Flutter documentation, say we had a log in route, a registration root and a home root, well
58

59
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,050
that works fine.
59

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,100
So whenever we're using this forward slash if you come from web development you'll know that to be our
60

61
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,000
different route.
61

62
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,500
So go to home or go to log in or go to registration.
62

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,070
And this kind of comes from that URL format right?
63

64
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,500
where we have our home page slash registration etc..
64

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,870
But when you're doing this in Flutter, if you have your routes start with that forward slash you must
65

66
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,800
define a route that has nothing after the forward slash.
66

67
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,520
So for example, you can't have something that looks like this.
67

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,730
You can have a /welcome /login /registration and maybe here this
68

69
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,030
one would be a /chat.
69

70
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,050
This will crash your app.
70

71
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,380
And if you tried to set the,for  example initial route to the welcome screen, then you can see this is the
71

72
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:28,230
error that you'll get. You'll get something about a global key was used multiple times inside one child's
72

73
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,670
list.
73

74
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:35,550
And this is perhaps not the best error message, even though Flutters really good at giving you precise
74

75
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,340
and clear error messages.
75

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,740
In this case the reason is because if you're going to use that forward slash format, one of these routes
76

77
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,580
has to be forward slash nothing.
77

78
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:54,150
So that way you can go to /log in or /chat or registration and it will work
78

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,850
just fine.
79

80
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,140
So make sure that even if you're using static properties or whatever it may be if you're declaring it
80

81
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:08,010
inside here, if you're going to use forward slashes make sure that one of those routes has nothing after
81

82
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,750
the forward slash.
82

83
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:17,250
But in this case I think it's actually more clear to do it the way that we did, which is to have a ID
83

84
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,460
for each screen such as welcome screen or the registration screen.
84

85
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,550
And we don't have to follow that forward slash convention.
