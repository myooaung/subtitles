1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.910
So first things first let's crack open Android Studio and start a new Flutter project.
2

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.890
We're going to be building this one completely from scratch.
3

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.430
Now once you've chosen Flutter application, click next and we're going to name our project to todoey_flutter.
4

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.410
And once we're done here then let's just click next and finish.
5

6
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.780
All right.
6

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.350
So here's our brand new application with the usual bells and whistles.
7

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.810
So we've got our main.dart which contains the sample counter app which I'm going to basically delete
8

9
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.200
pretty much most of it.
9

10
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.770
So I'm going to get rid of my home page.
10

11
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.810
I'm also going to get rid of myApp and instead I'm going to create it pretty much from scratch.
11

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.590
So I'm going to use the shortcut stless to create a new stateless widget and I'm going to call it My
12

13
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.050
App so that this matches with the app that I'm going to run.
13

14
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.740
Now whenever you see a red box around here this is created by Android Studio to make it easy for you
14

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.640
to tab around and to change certain things.
15

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.530
But if you want it to disappear just hit tab and it will go away.
16

17
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.910
Now inside my app instead of building a container, I actually want a material app.
17

18
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.160
So I'm going to add a material app which is going to have a home route, so the first screen that we're
18

19
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.120
going to see. And I'm going to call this a TaskScreen and I'm going to create it right here.
19

20
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.660
Now this has got a red squiggly line because obviously we don't have a task screen yet
20

21
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.700
so let's go ahead and create it.
21

22
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.330
So inside our lib folder I'm going to create a new folder and I'm going to call it screens.
22

23
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.730
So this is where we're going to be organizing our screen files. And then we're going to create a new
23

24
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.430
Dart file which I'm gonna call task and what I want to show up in the first screen of our app is going
24

25
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.850
to be something called TasksScreen.
25

26
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.030
And I'm going to create it with my round brackets.
26

27
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.340
Now I've got my red squiggly lines because TasksScreen doesn't yet exist.
27

28
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.150
So let's go ahead and create it by creating a new folder where I'm going to create all my screen files.
28

29
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.460
That's where I'm going to organize all my screen files and I'm going to create the first one which is
29

30
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.050
a Dart file that's going to be called
30

31
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.420
tasks_screen and I'm gonna hit enter.
31

32
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.440
And now we have our tasks_screen.dart.
32

33
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.310
So here I'm going to import material which I pretty much will always need when I'm creating UI.
33

34
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.830
And then I'm going to create a new stateless widget which is going to be called TasksScreen.
34

35
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.680
Now notice that in this case I've got an S here
35

36
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.650
so that we've got a plural,
36

37
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.350
so a large number of tasks which is show up on screen but just check to make sure that they match exactly.
37

38
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.050
And if you want it always easy to just copy and paste as well.
38

39
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.360
So we've still got a red squiggly line because we just need to import our screens/tasks_screen.dart
39

40
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.750
And now all the arrows are gone and we are no longer in trouble with Android Studio.
40

41
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.260
So finally let's go back to our top screen and let's start building out this screen.
41

42
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.730
We don't want to create just a container.
42

43
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.120
So I'm going to run my app as it is so that we can build while we see what we're building so that we
43

44
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.390
can paint our pixels onto the screen if you will.
44

45
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:40.250
So now that our build is done we've got this black screen which is not very exciting but we're going
45

46
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.070
to jazz it up very shortly.
46

47
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.770
So what is our app going to look like?
47

48
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.440
Well in the download section or the resources for this lesson you'll find a download to the to do a
48

49
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.450
mockups.
49

50
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.100
So I created these in Sketch which unfortunately is an application that's only available on Mac.
50

51
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.910
So I've actually exported my mockup to a PDF
51

52
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.900
so that you can download it and be able to zoom in and look around and pick out the colors and look
52

53
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.530
at what you need to design while you're doing it in Android Studio.
53

54
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.620
But I'm also going to be doing it step by step with you.
54

55
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.050
So let's take this design and let's transfer it into widgets.
55

56
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.150
So firstly we need to have a background color which is just a light blue accent color.
56

57
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.090
We don't want to have a container on screen but instead notice that we have our material app as the
57

58
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.420
top most widget.
58

59
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.480
Then very shortly it's followed by a task screen which takes us over here and we're going to build a
59

60
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.310
scaffold as usual.
60

61
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.260
So our scaffold is going to have a background color of light blue accent and as soon as I hit save we
61

62
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.680
see our color rendered on our simulator.
62

63
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.330
Now in this case, our scaffold is not going to have an app bar but it is of course going to have a body.
63

64
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.710
So the body of our scaffold is going to be a column widget because notice how in our mockup we've got
64

65
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.660
an icon,
65

66
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.290
we've got some text, some more text and then we've got this other component down here. So everything's
66

67
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.130
kind of more or less stacked vertically so I think a column will work quite nicely for this scenario.
67

68
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:38.230
And inside our column, we're going to have a bunch of children and the first child we'll have is this icon
68

69
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.980
here.
69

70
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.450
Now in order to grab the icon we're going to tap in to the icon widgets and the icon data is going to
70

71
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:53.800
be icons.list which is this one here, just looks kind of like a to do list.
71

72
00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:02.110
So now that I've added my icon, you can sort of see it just right over here in the top left corner. And
72

73
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.760
to make it a little bit easier,
73

74
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.060
let's add our text here as well.
74

75
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.440
Why don't we put the Todoey title?
75

76
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.280
So let's add a text widget and the string that's going to be inside the text widget is of course Todoey.
76

77
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.190
And once I hit save, then you'll see it's sort of all mangled up here in the top left corner.
77

78
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:29.230
Now one option is we could wrap our column inside, of course, our safe area widget which we normally use
78

79
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.840
to stay safe from the parts of our phone where the user can't really interact with.
79

80
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.690
So on the iPhone, it's around the notch. On the Android phone it's going to be around the status bar so
80

81
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.630
where it says the battery and the time et cetera.
81

82
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.500
And also this part on the iPhone is kind of the new home button
82

83
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.290
so that's also going to be outside of the safe area.
83

84
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.750
But for me this kind of margin is not really enough.
84

85
00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.880
I kind of want to push it down a little bit further because all our content is quite heavily padded
85

86
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.580
away from all the edges.
86

87
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:10.960
So instead of using a safe area, instead I'm actually just going to use a container because in our containers
87

88
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.630
remember there's always the padding property.
88

89
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.790
So let's pad our column and give it some edge insets.
89

90
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.450
Now instead of using the one that I normally use which is 'all' by giving it the same amount of padding
90

91
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.860
around all four sides, instead I'm going to choose 'only' in this case.
91

92
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.330
And this is because I want to have different amounts of padding for the top and the rest of the three
92

93
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.180
sides.
93

94
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.170
So first I'm going to start off with my top value which is actually going to be a whopping 6
94

95
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:52.570
because I want to push it down a lot. And then I've got my left which is going to be 30, my right which
95

96
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.030
is going to be 30
96

97
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.640
and the bottom which is going to be 30 as well.
97

98
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.380
So now let's hit save
98

99
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:08.230
and we see this push down far beyond all of this sort of busyness and it's now inside the sort of body
99

100
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.510
of our actual app.
100

101
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:16.450
Now all we need to do is make this look more like this.
101

102
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:22.750
So you think it's really far away but actually it doesn't take all that much code at all because everything
102

103
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.260
the widget
103

104
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.080
we just need to wrap some things inside widgets.
104

105
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.860
So the first thing is our icon is inside this little round circle thing.
105

106
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.330
And the easiest way to generate these profile icons or avatar icons or you know in this case just a
106

107
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.110
circle, is to wrap it inside a circle avatar.
107

108
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:52.420
So we've seen this before so I won't go into it in too much detail. But if you want to have a quick revision
108

109
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.710
of what circle Avatar does or in fact any of the widgets I talk about,
109

110
00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:02.720
be sure to have a look at the Flutter docs which, as always, is constantly being updated.
110

111
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.760
And it has more information than you'll ever want on any of these widgets.
111

112
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.020
So now that I've created my circle avatar, it has a icon inside it.
112

113
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:20.140
But I also want to change some other properties about the circle avatar namely maybe the background
113

114
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:20.520
color.
114

115
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.260
So let's change it to colors.white.
115

116
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.440
And now we've got a nice white icon
116

117
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.160
so looking pretty similar right? Now all we have to do is make it a little bit bigger.
117

118
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.770
So let's change the radius of our circle to let's say 30 pixels.
118

119
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.100
So that ends up being probably a diameter of about 60.
119

120
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.080
So it looks a lot bigger.
120

121
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:49.120
And now in contrast, our icon looks a little bit too small
121

122
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.220
so let's change our icon size as well.
122

123
00:09:52.220 --> 00:10:01.090
But there's a property called size in icon and let's change that to 30 to match with the parent circle
123

124
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.290
avatar.
124

125
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.920
Now remember whenever you are stuck or can't remember what properties a widget has, the easiest way is
125

126
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.230
to hold down COMMAND on Mac or
126

127
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.480
CONTROL on Windows and then just hover over the widget and you'll be able to see all the properties
127

128
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.000
that you can change.
128

129
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.580
Now if you want more information on any of these properties, then simply having your cursor on the widget
129

130
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:32.410
and then going to our Quick documentation, which on Mac in my case is F1, but on your system it might
130

131
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:32.990
be different.
131

132
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.010
So have a quick look under View,
132

133
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:41.710
Quick documentation to see the shortcut. And that will bring up of course the docs as well as all the
133

134
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.560
properties and a way of being able to not just see what you can do but also understand the widget a
134

135
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.970
little bit better.
135

136
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:56.590
And finally the final step is of course you can hold down COMMAND on Mac or CONTROL Windows and just
136

137
00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.310
click on it to see the source because Flutter's open source
137

138
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.610
right?
138

139
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.510
If you ever want to figure out how anything works or how to modify it,
139

140
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.860
that's the final all encompassing way of going about that.
140

141
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:09.160
All right.
141

142
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:18.760
So icon is looking pretty good but if you have a keen eye for design, you might have noticed that this
142

143
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:25.630
blue is a little bit different from this blue and that's because by default all of our material apps
143

144
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:34.120
get a blue color, which is colors.blue, as the main theme color. But in our case we want to switch
144

145
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.790
that out.
145

146
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:42.580
So let's change the icon color to also colors.lightBlueAccent to make it match. See, looks much better.
146

147
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.420
Now 
147

148
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:51.020
the next thing we want to do is add maybe a little bit of space between the icon and the Todoey title.
148

149
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.800
So here I've pretty much got just a 10 pixel gap in between.
149

150
00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:04.060
So because we're working inside a column, it's very easy to add that into the column as a sizedBox.
150

151
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.900
You don't have to mess with wrapping things deeper and deeper inside padding widgets.
151

152
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:14.800
So let's add a sized box with a height because that's the only dimension that we're concerned about
152

153
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.080
inside a column which is vertical.
153

154
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.820
And now we have a little bit of space, a little bit of breathing room, in between our user interface icons.
154

155
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.940
So now let's work on our text widget.
155

156
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:36.100
So we've got some writing, some string, in there which says Todoey. But let's change the style of our
156

157
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.940
text.
157

158
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:48.080
So let's change the text style widget to have a color of colors.white and then what else have we got?
158

159
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:54.330
We've got quite a large font size and it's also a bit heavier on the font weight,
159

160
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.640
right?
160

161
00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:04.330
So let's change the font size to... let's make it a really big text maybe 50. And let's change the font
161

162
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.590
weight as well,
162

163
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.330
and I'm going to change this to a .w700
163

164
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:16.940
so this is a 700 weight which is quite heavy and it's a little bit more heavy than bold.
164

165
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:22.030
So you know that we could use bold, normal, light et cetera.
165

166
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:30.160
But you can also have more fine grained control by using the 100, 200 all the way up to 900. So let's choose
166

167
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:39.240
a 700 which should add a little bit of thickness to our title and make it look very important.
167

168
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.910
So now you can see that everything is kind of shifted in our column though right?
168

169
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.450
So what's going on?
169

170
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:54.190
Well let's take a look inside Flutter inspector and let's show debug paint to see where everything is.
170

171
00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.250
Now you can also of course just change the background color of the column or wrap it inside a container
171

172
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.230
or do funky things.
172

173
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.460
But this is the easiest way of seeing what's happening with our layout and those of you guys coming from
173

174
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.290
Web Dev.
174

175
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.190
this is pretty much second nature to you, going into the Chrome developer tools or the Firefox developer
175

176
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.640
tools.
176

177
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.130
This is what we're expecting to see.
177

178
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:21.310
So you can see that here is our column and inside it we've got two items.
178

179
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:27.010
One is the circle avatar and the other is our Todoey title.
179

180
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:33.520
So inside within the column, both of these things are centered by default.
180

181
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.440
But the column only takes up as much width as the children need.
181

182
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.880
So if this to do a title it was gigantic
182

183
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:51.070
let's say I change it to, I don't know 200, then you'll see it forces the column to expand as far as it
183

184
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.790
can within its parent which is within the scaffold.
184

185
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.490
But in our case we don't actually want the child to change.
185

186
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.120
We don't want to change the dimensions of this title quite happy with that.
186

187
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:11.920
But instead what we want is to make everything inside our column to be aligned to the left of the column
187

188
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.620
which is also known as the start of the column.
188

189
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:23.290
So let's switch that off and let's go ahead and change a property on our column which is of course our cross
189

190
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.990
AxisAlignment and I'm going to choose start.
190

191
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.620
So now let's hit save and you'll see that everything now moves to the left of the column
191

192
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.360
even though the size of the column has not changed.
192

193
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.140
All right, cool.
193

194
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.090
So now if we compare, we're getting pretty close
194

195
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.640
right? And it looks pretty similar.
195

196
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:53.200
Now let's go ahead and add the next piece of text. So below this text widget, let's add another text widget
196

197
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.020
and this one is going to show us how many tasks we have left to do.
197

198
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:07.270
So I'm going to just add a default sort of hardcoded string of 12 tasks and then I'm gonna change some
198

199
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:13.480
of the styling of this text widget by changing its color firstly.
199

200
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.660
So I also want this to be white
200

201
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.730
and I'm going to change the font size to 18.
201

202
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.290
So just a little bit bigger.
202

203
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.170
And that should do perfectly for now.
203

204
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.720
So now we've got the top part of our app laid out.
204

205
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:40.210
The next thing to look at is this bottom half where we've got this white area with rounded corners and
205

206
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:46.180
it looks really neat because it looks almost like we've got some sort of a little to do list card that
206

207
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.410
is sitting on top of to do list name or to do this title.
207

208
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.620
So how can we create this?
208

209
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.300
Well we could create maybe a container.
209

210
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.970
So in our column we've got currently four things.
210

211
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.220
And right at the end of that text widget, let's try adding a container. And our container is going to
211

212
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.560
get a color.
212

213
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.420
And it's going to be a white color,
213

214
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.670
so colors.white.
214

215
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.450
But notice that nothing actually shows up when I hot reload
215

216
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:24.720
and that's because containers only show up when they have children with a dimension.
216

217
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.150
In this case this container doesn't have any children at all.
217

218
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.840
But we can force it to show up by giving it some dimensions.
218

219
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.910
So let's give it a height of 300.
219

220
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.180
And we can see our container now right here with a height
220

221
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.080
and it's also taking up the full width of our column.
221

222
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:54.070
So how can we turn this white square into this nice little rounded corner card? So one of the properties
222

223
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.190
that a container has is something called a decoration.
223

224
00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:06.250
And so we can set it to a box decoration widget which gives us a whole bunch of ways of manipulating
224

225
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.530
the appearance of a box.
225

226
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:18.940
So firstly, we can move the color property over here because actually if we tried to set a color on both
226

227
00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:25.020
the box decoration property as well as the container color property,
227

228
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.410
notice that if I hit save
228

229
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.460
now it's actually going to crash.
229

230
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:38.200
And it tells me that there is an issue because either the color property has to be null or the decoration
230

231
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.540
has to be null.
231

232
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:46.630
You can't have both a color and a decoration because the color argument, this one, is just a shorthand
232

233
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.430
for decoration, BoxDecoration color.
233

234
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:56.770
So this is basically a shorthand for creating a new box decoration with a color.
234

235
00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.990
So it's exclusive or. So you can only have one or the other.
235

236
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.140
So now let's hit save and we'll see it turn into a red box,
236

237
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.340
but we want a white box.
237

238
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:15.220
So now that we've got our box decoration, then we can go ahead and give it a border radius.
238

239
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:23.730
So a border radius will turn our box from a square box into a rounded corner box.
239

240
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:31.360
But I don't want rounded corners on all four sides because then it'll look like I've got some sort of
240

241
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.050
large icon living on my screen.
241

242
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.130
Instead I only want to curve the edges on the top.
242

243
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:47.140
So the way I do this is by creating a new border radius widget and I'm going to use the 'only' method
243

244
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.600
to only set up the top left and the top right.
244

245
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.820
So this is going to take a radius, so radius.circular.
245

246
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:04.390
And I'm going to give it 20 pixel border radius on the top left and the top right,
246

247
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.940
so this is going to be another circular radius of 20.
247

248
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.120
So now let's hit save.
248

249
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:20.310
And you can see we've got our little curved edges at the top and we've got a completely square or 90
249

250
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.220
degree bottom to our little container.
250

251
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.970
It's looking pretty cool right?
251

252
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.870
But how can we get it to extend all the way down to the bottom because at the moment it looks like it's
252

253
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.060
just a bit cut off?
253

254
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.140
Well one way is by increasing the height.
254

255
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.730
But let's say that I made the height too large, then it's going gonna go off the screen and I've got
255

256
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.390
my overflow problems.
256

257
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.300
So instead, what we want to do is delete that hard coded height
257

258
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:59.230
and instead we can wrap our container inside an expanded widget which is going to expand its child, the
258

259
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.710
container, so that it can take up as much space as there exists.
259

260
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:14.540
But there's still one problem because at the moment in our card, there's a padding on all these sides
260

261
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:23.030
over here, over here and over here. But in our mockup, you can see that it goes all the way to all the edges.
261

262
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.650
Now why is that?
262

263
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.720
Why does it have padding?
263

264
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:35.090
Well it's because that container lives inside our column and our column lives inside a container which
264

265
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.000
has some padding, namely 30 pixels on the left, 30 on the right
265

266
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.840
And 30 at the bottom.
266

267
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:50.510
So in order to free our container from this padding, we actually have to take it out of this column and
267

268
00:21:50.510 --> 00:22:00.350
instead I'm going to create another column - this column with the Todoey, the task, the icon - is going
268

269
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:04.090
to be nested inside another column.
269

270
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:10.720
So I'm going to wrap my container inside another brand new column.
270

271
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:21.860
So now inside this column, I've got a container which contains all of this. But I've also got my expanded
271

272
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.950
widget which has the white curved card.
272

273
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:33.710
And now if I go ahead and take off the debug paint, then you can see I've achieved what I've been looking
273

274
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:38.770
to do which is that curved edge card like what I've got over here.
274

275
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:48.920
But there's one problem though because this column seems to have centered everything by default, because
275

276
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.520
this new column has its cross origin set as center.
276

277
00:22:54.530 --> 00:23:00.920
So in order to move everything back to the left again in this new column I also have to set the cross
277

278
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.130
axis alignment to start. Brilliant.
278

279
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.920
We're getting pretty close to our final desired mockup.
279

280
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:18.190
All we have to do now is add a floating action button which is pretty easy. In our scaffold
280

281
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:25.930
we've got our background color, our body and we're now going to add a FAB or a floating action button.
281

282
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:33.340
And it's really easy to just type FAB for Android Studio to pick it up for you because I'm just too
282

283
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.280
lazy to write floating action button.
283

284
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.120
I mean maybe they should just call it a floating button or floating circle.
284

285
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:50.800
But anyways now inside this floating action button, I'm going to give it a color, a background color property,
285

286
00:23:51.340 --> 00:24:00.910
and it's going to be our favorite color which is light blue accent and it's also going to have a child
286

287
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.690
which is going to be that add sign,
287

288
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.380
so it's gonna be another icon.
288

289
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.550
It's called icons.add.
289

290
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:10.810
Simple.
290

291
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:17.280
Now we've got our floating action button and pretty much most of our user interface laid out.
291

292
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:25.840
All we have to do now is to figure out how to create a scrolling list that we can embed inside this
292

293
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:33.760
container here. And in that list is going to be a whole bunch of the list items with a name for our task
293

294
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.700
and a little checkbox that we can check off. For all of that and more,
294

295
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.120
I'll see on the next lesson.
