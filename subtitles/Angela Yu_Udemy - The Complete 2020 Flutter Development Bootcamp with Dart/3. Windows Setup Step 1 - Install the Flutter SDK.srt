00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,180
Welcome to part 1 of the Windows Flutter installation instructions, which hopefully means that you
1

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,260
have a PC running Windows 7 or later.
2

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,900
These are some of the minimum requirements that you'll need to get started installing Flutter including
3

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,350
having at least 400 megabytes of free space.
4

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,500
But practically speaking, you'll actually want more. Although Flutter only requires 400 megabytes as a
5

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,850
minimum requirement,
6

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,940
you'll want at least 10 gigabytes free on your hard disk because you also have to install Android Studio
7

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,590
as well as virtual devices like the Android emulator.
8

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,850
Finally you'll also need to have a program called 'Git' installed.
9

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,120
Now don't worry if you don't or you don't know if you do,
10

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,720
we're going to check it together and we're going to do the installation together.
11

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,540
So first things first, you're going to need the Flutter SDK, and you can get this as well as all the step
12

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:04,320
by step installation instructions from flutter.dev/docs/get-started  Now,
13

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,230
once you're here, you're going to choose the Windows track, and an important note to notice is that if you
14

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,220
are based in China where the Google servers are disabled,
15

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,770
make sure you head over here where you'll find that the Flutter community has set up mirrors for all
16

17
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,330
of the downloads that you'll need to get Flutter up and running so that all the download links will
17

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,390
work even if you're based in China.
18

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,750
All right.
19

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,160
So let's go ahead into the Windows insulation instructions.
20

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,760
Now at this point if you don't have 'Git' installed, be sure to click on this link
21

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,050
'Git for Windows', and it will take you to a page that will automatically start downloading Git for your
22

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,820
system.
23

24
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:52,630
And once it's complete, double click on the file and it will start installing it onto your Windows system.
24

25
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,190
Now this has a really simple setup wizard.
25

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,600
And you basically just click next and keep all of the default requirements and keep going until you
26

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,180
get to the end.
27

28
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,920
Once that's done, then we're ready to start downloading the Flutter SDK.
28

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,530
This is going to contain all the code that we'll need to be able to start developing Flutter apps.
29

30
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,560
Now, once you already, click on this big blue button and you should download the Flutter for Windows zip
30

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,020
file. Now, once download is finished,
31

32
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,820
go ahead and open up the zip file and you'll need to click on extract all.
32

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,520
Now the place that we're going to extract it to is really important.
33

34
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,550
Flutter recommends putting it in a file path that's directly in the C drive for example C:\src
34

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,440
\flutter
35

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,550
Now it's really important that you don't put this in something like C:/programfiles which requires
36

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,410
special access privileges.
37

38
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,560
We want all users to be able to access this Flutter folder.
38

39
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,480
So once you're done, go ahead and select show extracted files when complete and extract it to that location.
39

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,030
Now it's going to take a while to complete.
40

41
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,690
But once it's done, it should open up inside our src\flutter
41

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,970
and then you've got Flutter installed on your system and you can start running Flutter commands by locating
42

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,600
the file could flutter_console.bat. Double click on it, and when you do this, you might
43

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,430
encounter a 'Windows protected your PC' popup.
44

45
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:43,740
And if you do, go ahead and click on 'more info' and go ahead and click on 'run anyways.' And this will open
45

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:51,360
up the command prompt in Windows and you can start typing Flutter commands such as flutter --
46

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,330
version and it will tell you that you've got Flutter
47

48
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,130
1.2.1 currently installed on your system.
48

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,140
But as it is, we can only use Flutter from the command prompt.
49

50
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,660
It knows how to locate the Flutter package.
50

51
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,550
But if we want to use it from somewhere else,
51

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,720
say Android Studio or if we just opened up a normal Windows command prompt, then we'll need to tell it
52

53
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,990
where this Flutter package is located.
53

54
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,060
So to prevent having to do that every single time, we're going to set our path variable.
54

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:33,270
So if you head into start and you search for 'env' then you should see a link to edit environment variables
55

56
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,980
for your account.
56

57
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,540
So that's what we're going to click on.
57

58
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:46,200
And over here, under the user variables, check to see if there's an entry code path.
58

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,530
And I can see it right here.
59

60
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,040
Once you found it,
60

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:59,940
go ahead and select it and click on 'edit', and inside this variable value, navigate all the way to the end
61

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,790
of what currently exists.
62

63
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:09,370
And then you're going to add the full path to our flutter\bin
63

64
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,860
So if you go over here you can see that there is the bin folder right here,
64

65
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:23,960
and the way to navigate to it is C:\src\flutter\flutter\bin So that's
65

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,450
what we're going to add to our path. All the way at the very end,
66

67
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,150
We're going to add a ; and then you're going to type the path to locate that bin folder.
67

68
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:46,790
So in my case it's going to be C:\src\flutter\flutter\bin
68

69
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,330
bin. And check to make sure that you don't have any errors in them and then go ahead and click OK to
69

70
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,160
add the path variable.
70

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,890
Now if you don't have a user variable code path, then you can simply go ahead and create a new one that's
71

72
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:08,540
called Path,  P-A-T-H, with all caps and then put in that variable value as the location of that bin folder
72

73
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,280
that we typed in just now. Once you're done,
73

74
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,680
go ahead and click Ok.
74

75
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,190
And you should now be able to run Flutter from anywhere.
75

76
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,940
So for example, I could simply open up command prompt from START, and I should be able to type a flutter
76

77
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,960
--version and it should confirm to me that I have a Flutter 
77

78
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,650
1.2.1 installed on my current system.
78

79
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:46,350
Now another really helpful console command is 'flutter doctor', and it will diagnose to see how our Flutter
79

80
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,590
is set up and if there are any other things that we still need to sort out before we can continue.
80

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,230
So you can see that in this checklist we've got Flutter set up and ready to go.
81

82
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,450
We've got little checkmark but for everything else including Android Studio, Android toolchain and
82

83
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,560
any connected devices, all of these have a exclamation mark.
83

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,480
So that's what we're going to address in the next lesson.
84

85
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,720
We're going to install Android Studio and get set up for android development.
85

86
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,790
So, for all of that and more, I'll see on the next lesson.
