Hey guys.
1

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.020
Today it's Angela and the office crayfish. The office crayfish
2

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:16.210
and I would like to congratulate you on getting this far, so well done for completing the last module,
3

4
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.680
and we're both really proud of you. Now,
4

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:28.610
today I want to talk about something I've heard students say a lot and, you know, it's this idea like
5

6
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.920
maybe like I'm not cut out for programming, maybe like I just wasn't born with a particular brain that’s 
6

7
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.590
required to think in this way, maybe like this is just not for me. And, you know, why is it that so and
7

8
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.780
so like they just pick it up like that?
8

9
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.560
Like why are they just born to do it, you know?
9

10
00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:02.400
And what I want to say to that is like, nobody is born to have a certain skill, right? Or, you know, there's
10

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.050
a lot of things that require a lot of dedication to be able to achieve the result that people get.
11

12
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.420
You just don't see it, that's all.
12

13
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.680
Now, you know, you never see like a baby like just being born that’s all like really muscular, right?
13

14
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.790
Like that doesn't happen. In order to get muscular, in order to get strong,
14

15
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.770
you’ve got to go to the gym, you've got to put in the ropes, like nobody can help you with that, no matter
15

16
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.180
how rich or how privileged or how smart you are.
16

17
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.250
If you don't go to the gym you're not going to get stronger.
17

18
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.140
And it's the same with a lot of other skills, you know, like, with programming, I would bet that there is
18

19
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.940
no one programmer who you can find who hasn't done the work.
19

20
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.950
Like you don't just show up on your day one and you’re like, well, I know everything. That doesn't work.
20

21
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.990
And in most cases, like, you know, people often hide like the hard work that's required in order to get
21

22
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.030
to where they are.
22

23
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.890
Like if you think about the game Pokemon Go, like you remember that from like a few years ago, how it
23

24
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.090
just blew up overnight and literally everybody was walking around playing Pokemon Go, I swear.
24

25
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.760
And newspapers were saying like, “Oh, overnight sensation, Pokemon Go.”
25

26
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.960
And it's like you know the creators stumbled on like some sort of a pot of gold.
26

27
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.540
But actually like, do you know how many other games that Niantic
27

28
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.670
and the founders of Niantic have built before that?
28

29
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.220
Like how many have failed and how many were just kind of meh, like until they had this big moment?
29

30
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.520
We don't see that.
30

31
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.300
But it doesn't mean it doesn't happen,
31

32
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.710
right?
32

33
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.330
So, in order to get good at something, you've got to show up, you’ve got to put in the hours, and then you'll
33

34
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.810
get the results that you deserve.
34

35
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.800
And in fact you know like if you suddenly just like win the lottery and you get something that you haven't
35

36
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.610
really worked hard for you never really cherish it.
36

37
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.990
Like if somebody gives you a gift and you didn't have to work hard for it it's not the same as the thing
37

38
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.990
that you know you worked a whole summer for like washing dishes.
38

39
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.280
Like I certainly remember that.
39

40
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.160
Like that thing that you buy is so different from something that somebody usually gives you.
40

41
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.090
So put in the work, put in the effort, and the results will happen, I promise, and I am here for you and
41

42
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.460
I'm here cheering you on. I believe in you.
42

43
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.920
And I think you're going to do great.
43

44
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.330
So just keep going.
