Hey, it's Angela again and I'm here to congratulate you on coming
1

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,990
really really far in the course.
2

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,310
Not everybody gets to see these videos that you're watching.
3

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,990
And just in terms of your perseverance and the level of dedication that you have to be able to reach
4

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,870
here, it's fantastic,
5

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,670
and it really sets you apart from other people.
6

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,250
So congratulations.
7

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,500
You deserve a back.
8

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,540
You deserve a pat on the back.
9

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,370
Now I also want to talk about something that I've heard a lot of students say when they reach around
10

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,820
this kind of time point, where they say like, "Oh, you know, even though I've been going on and learning
11

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:49,580
for so long, I've done like a 100 days, one hour a day, and I still feel like I don't know anything, I don't
12

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,840
know everything.".
13

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,530
And, firstly, nobody knows everything.
14

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,110
Even if you just take something as simple as like one particular technology, there's too many things
15

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,460
to know.
16

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,970
You only learn the things that are relevant to what it is that you're trying to achieve,
17

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:14,360
now aside from the fundamental skills of course. So the thing I tend to tell students is, you've actually
18

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:24,200
made huge leaps in terms of where you were before but it's just that as you keep getting more advanced
19

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,650
and there's more advanced topics coming up around you your level of struggle seems to be kind of constant,
20

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:30,890
right?
21

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,570
It doesn't ever really get easier and I can testify to that like even at my level,
22

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,460
there are still loads of things that really are mind boggling.
23

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,620
I sit there thinking like "Oh, I wish I was smart and I could just understand this immediately". But this
24

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,240
is just, it's fantasy.
25

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,460
We all have to work hard in order to get what we actually end up with, our results.
26

27
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:04,340
So what I want you to do, whenever you feel like "I've done so much work and yet I don't, I can't, I don't
27

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,920
feel like I know everything yet" is to go to the early parts of the course,
28

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,430
have a look at the questions that the students who are just starting out, you know, maybe in the first second
29

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:23,510
and third modules, see what questions they're asking and see how easy it is for you to answer those questions
30

31
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,790
because of where you are now.
31

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,300
Those struggles that they have and you probably had at one point as well are so much easier for you
32

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,120
to be able to understand. And you can see at a glance like "Oh yeah, that's totally because of this,
33

34
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:46,240
because of that". And just by answering some of these student questions, the people who are at an
34

35
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:56,390
earlier stage, you actually feel like you've gone further and you know you have achieved a lot since
35

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,660
when you first started.
36

37
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,100
So try it out.
37

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,410
Let me know how it goes.
38

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:07,010
And I hope you will keep going and that you will achieve your potential.
39

40
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,180
So keep going.
