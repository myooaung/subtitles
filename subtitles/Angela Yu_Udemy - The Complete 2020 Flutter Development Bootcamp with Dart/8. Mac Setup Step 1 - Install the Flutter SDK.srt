0
1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,570
So for those of you who are Mac users, this is the track where we're going to install Flutter and all
2

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,710
of the related components on your Mac.
3

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,150
So first things first.
4

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,990
What are the minimum system requirements?
5

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,740
Now you're going to need to be running macOS and you should have at least 700 megabytes,
6

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,620
if it is just for the Flutter installation. Now, because when we build our Flutter apps, the whole point
7

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,700
of it is that we're going to be able to deploy it on iOS and Android.
8

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,520
It means that you'll need Android Studio and Xcode, which are both large applications.
9

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,670
So I would say that at least have around 10 gigabytes free on your laptop, if not more, so that you'll
10

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,840
have a smooth experience setting up and installing.
11

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,430
Now you should be running Mac OS 10 and ideally, you should really be on Mac OS Mojave, which is 10.
12

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,360
14.
13

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,550
And the reason for this is because if you want to be running your iOS  app onto a, say a physical device
14

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,800
that's running the latest version of iOS , iOS 12, then the only way to do that is through having Mojave
15

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,490
installed on your laptop.
16

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:20,760
Now however, you can still get away with having a lower version of Mac OS if you want to either just
17

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,880
develop Flutter apps. Flutter is not that picky about your Mac OS version but the one application does
18

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,870
care is Xcode, which is the software that we're going to need to be able to deploy our apps onto the
19

20
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,290
iOS simulator or an iOS device.
20

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,400
So if you don't mind so much about running on the latest iOS versions, then you can also get away with
21

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,360
just having High Sierra as your Mac operating system.
22

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,910
Now as I mentioned in the very beginning, if you're running macOS Catalina, then be sure that you've
23

24
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,370
completed all the steps in the test lesson at the very beginning of this journey, so that you've changed
24

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,930
your terminal from Bash to Zsh before you continue.
25

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,440
Now first things first, we're going to get started by heading over to flutter.dev/get-
26

27
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,240
started and you're going to choose your installation track.
27

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,440
So a good point to mention at this point is that if you're based in China and the Google servers are
28

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,140
blocked, then the Flutter development community have actually setup some mirrors that will allow you
29

30
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,010
to download everything you need just the same even if you're based in China.
30

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,970
OK.
31

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,170
So once you're ready, go ahead and choose Mac OS and you'll see a very long list of installation instructions.
32

33
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,390
But don't worry, we're going to go through them together.
33

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,250
And I'm going to share my tips with you as well just to make it a little bit simpler a little bit easier
34

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,970
to get set up.
35

36
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,790
So first things first, you're going to download the installation bundle which is a zip file and this
36

37
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,670
is going to contain all of the Flutter code and all of things are going to enable you to build Flutter apps.
37

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,480
So give that a few moments,
38

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,430
and once it's done you should be able to find it in your downloads folder and it will be a zip file.
39

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,210
So you're going to double click on it to unzip the compressed file.
40

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Now once extraction has completed, you should end up with a folder called 'flutter'.
41

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,270
And if you double click to open it, you'll see all sorts of things that have been shipped.
42

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,030
Now, it's important that we move this folder out of the downloads folder and into somewhere permanent.
43

44
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,140
So the ideal place to put it is under your username and maybe in a folder.
44

45
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,130
So down here you can see that here's my Macintosh hard drive,
45

46
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,610
there's a folder called users.
46

47
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,690
And here is my current user username, and this is where we want to navigate to.
47

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,180
Now you can either double click down here or if you can't find that, then simply hold down COMMAND and
48

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,410
press the up arrow continuously until you get to Macintosh HD, and you should be able to go to users
49

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,740
and find your username. So once you've got your home folder open,
50

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,430
so the one under your username, then here
51

52
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,820
go ahead and create a new folder and you're going to call it developer, and then hit enter.
52

53
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:29,840
And now we're going to move that Flutter folder that we had previously from our downloads into our developer
53

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,130
folder.
54

55
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,640
So now you can see the full path is Macintosh HD.
55

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,930
So this is the root of our computer.
56

57
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,270
Then it goes to users, then to our username, then to developer, to flutter.
57

58
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,090
Now once you've done this then you're ready to move on to the next part which is a little bit tricky
58

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,640
because we have to tap in to the terminal.
59

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,230
So over here go ahead and launch spotlight and you're going to search for the terminal app.
60

61
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,430
And then once you've found it hit enter to open it up.
61

62
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,660
If you are using Mac OS Catalina, then follow the steps
62

63
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:13,190
I'm going to tell you now. If you're using an older Mac OS such as Mojave or High Sierra or Sierra, then
63

64
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,660
continue on in this video.
64

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,410
And at 9:22, I'll show you how to do the same thing using those operating systems.
65

66
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,410
Now once you've got the terminal open, then go ahead and just check to see that you've actually got the
66

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,470
Z shell enabled, and you should see zsh at the top of your window.
67

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,590
Now if you look at the Mac OS installation instructions that Flutter has provided, and you scroll down
68

69
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,710
to the section that says Update your path,
69

70
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,790
this is exactly what we're going to do.
70

71
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:53,990
So we're going to find a file called .zshrc and this lives in our home folder. So to open it, all
71

72
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:04,310
we have to do is type 'vim ~/.zshrc' and notice that there's a
72

73
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,280
space between vim and the rest of this line.
73

74
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,150
But inside this line, it should be a complete path with no spaces.
74

75
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:20,600
So now hit ENTER, and it should now open up this file called zshrc using a text editor called vim
75

76
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,890
which is always installed by default with all Macs.
76

77
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,260
Now in order to start editing this file, you're going to hit the 'i' key in on your keyboard in order
77

78
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,140
to start inserting text.
78

79
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,220
And now we're going to add this entire string over.
79

80
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:43,910
So go ahead and copy this code here and go ahead and hit COMMAND V to paste it into this file.
80

81
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:49,460
Now notice how there's this part which is enclosed in square brackets,  [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_
81

82
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,210
GIT_DIRECTORY] You're going to delete it and remember that you're only deleting the part inside the square
82

83
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,100
brackets.
83

84
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,750
So you should be left with $PATH:/flutter/bin
84

85
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:12,590
So if you remember, previously we had extracted the entire flutter folder into our username/developer
85

86
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,870
/flutter.
86

87
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,010
So we have to provide the path to actually get to this flutter/bin folder.
87

88
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,080
So in my case it's my homefolder/developer.
88

89
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,310
So in my case I'm going to type $
89

90
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:35,890
HOME/Developer/flutter/bin
90

91
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:44,180
And this, you'll notice, is going to correspond to going to the home folder which is this username/
91

92
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,500
developer/flutter.
92

93
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,150
And inside this flutter folder, there is a bin folder which we need to point to.
93

94
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,630
And that's what this line does.
94

95
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,810
So once you're done with this, then go ahead and hit the ESC key and then :wq
95

96
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,740
!
96

97
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,800
Now the next step, once you've done that and you're back in the terminal, is to actually close down the
97

98
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,450
current window and start a new window either by going to Shell, New Window with profile or simply just
98

99
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,370
hitting COMMAND + N.
99

100
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:27,830
Now once you've opened up a new window, then you can go ahead and run the command: flutter 
100

101
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:36,140
--version to confirm if your installation was successful. And if at this point you see something about
101

102
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:43,220
Flutter, channel stable... something like this then brilliant. You're done for this lesson and you can skip
102

103
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,030
to the next lesson. But if at this point you see a pop up saying something about 'dart can't be open because
103

104
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:57,230
the developer cannot be verified,' then you have to make sure that you go back to the Flutter installation
104

105
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,130
website and download the latest SDK.
105

106
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,340
So just go ahead and click download again and replace what's in your developer folder the current the
106

107
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:14,130
current Flutter folder, delete it and replace it with the latest one that you've downloaded and extract
107

108
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,470
it.
108

109
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,990
Then once you've done that you can go back into the terminal and run that command 'flutter 
109

110
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,760
--version' again.
110

111
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:28,440
And it should now work. So for the next part of this lesson, I'm going to show you how to add the path
111

112
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,790
to your computer
112

113
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:36,600
if you're using an older version of Mac OS such as Mac OS Mojave or High Sierra. And the way that we're
113

114
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,920
going to do that is you should see your username right before a dollar sign.
114

115
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:50,250
This is what we call the prompt and you're going to type in 'vim .bash_profile'
115

116
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,830
Now make sure that you spelt it exactly the way you see it here, and then you go to hit ENTER and, you're
116

117
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,450
going to enter what's called vim.
117

118
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,750
And if you're not a vim user, then it can seem a bit weird at first because this is actually a text editor,
118

119
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,710
and some people even write code here.
119

120
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,710
Now here is where we're going to add this line.
120

121
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,020
But this part where it says [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY] and including those square brackets, we have to
121

122
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:23,070
replace with the actual path that we have that navigates to this Flutter directory, which is Macintosh
122

123
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:31,670
HD users/username/developer. So we're going to do this in two parts.
123

124
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,180
We're first going to copy everything up to the colon, so not including that dollar sign.
124

125
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:43,250
So starting from export all the way up to and including the colon, I'm going to paste it into this
125

126
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,860
batch profile here.
126

127
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,330
So that's the first part.
127

128
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,750
Now the next part we need to get the path to our Flutter folder.
128

129
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,580
So this one right here.
129

130
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,480
And the trick is we're going to hold it and we're going to drag it into our terminal.
130

131
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,520
So it'll put in that entire file path that navigates to this folder into our terminal.
131

132
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:11,870
And now we're going to add /bin to the very end of our path, and close it off with some
132

133
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,220
quotation marks.
133

134
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:21,030
So in order to insert tags and start typing in vim, you have to hit the 'i' key, and i stands for insert.
134

135
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,170
So now we can type /bin and we can close it off with some double quotes.
135

136
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,850
So this is the entirety of the path for me anyways.
136

137
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,010
And I'm obviously using my colleague's computer because I already have Flutter set up and ready to go.
137

138
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,190
But I wanted to be able to show you how to do this because it's kind of fiddly.
138

139
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,170
So what you should end up with is export  PATH=
139

140
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,430
and then here is where we specify that entire path.
140

141
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,420
And the first part came from dragging and dropping the Flutter folder.
141

142
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:03,510
Now, of course, inside the Flutter folder, we have a folder called bin and this is what Flutter needs to
142

143
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,910
locate to be able to work from anywhere on your computer.
143

144
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,490
So once you're done and you're happy with this, theoretically the only parts that should be different
144

145
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,560
for you is just your username.
145

146
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:21,020
If you had saved a Flutter inside the developer folder as we did in the last step.
146

147
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,550
But now that we're done we're going to hit the ESC key.
147

148
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:31,170
And then you're going to type :wq!
148

149
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:37,760
And this saves this file and quits the file in sort of crazy vim lingo.
149

150
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,490
Now there's all sorts of jokes about people never being able to get out of vim.
150

151
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,130
I hope you're not one of them, and I hope you'll be able to continue with me along the course. Once we're
151

152
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:55,230
done adding the path we're going to go ahead and quit terminal, and we're going to restart it again.
152

153
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:02,310
And now I'm going to check that everything worked by typing in flutter --version.
153

154
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,620
So now if I hit enter it should
154

155
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,560
tell me which version of flutter I'm running. At the moment it's 1.2.1.
155

156
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,100
It also tells me which version of Dart I'm running which is 2.1.2.
156

157
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,230
Now while we're here, the other command that's really useful in the terminal is 'flutter doctor'.
157

158
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,340
And this will diagnose our little Flutter and see how it's doing.
158

159
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,580
Now if you get a pop up like this just simply go ahead and click OK.
159

160
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,100
And you should
160

161
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:41,100
now be able to  see what is already set up and what's not yet set up. So you can see we've got a whole
161

162
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,280
bunch of crosses in here and we're gonna go through them in the next few lessons.
