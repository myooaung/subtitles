0
1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,780
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,110
So we've already gotten pretty far. But the next thing that I want to create are these little boxes. These
2

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:14,250
boxes that contain an icon and also a phone number or an email address, whatever it is that you want
3

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,550
to show.
4

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:23,070
Now you can use an image asset as an icon. But it's nowhere near as adaptable as simply using an icon
5

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,490
widget.
6

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,600
And I want to show you how this works.
7

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,570
If we collapse both of our text widgets and our circle avatar, then we can see that in our column, we
8

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,660
currently have three things, our circle avatar, our text which is our name,
9

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,810
and finally, the job title that we have here.
10

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:51,020
So I'm gonna go ahead and add another child and this is gonna be a container. Now inside this container,
11

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,520
the only child that it's gonna have is a row.
12

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,810
And very often when you're creating user interfaces in Flutter, you'll find yourself embedding rows
13

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,660
inside columns or columns inside rows.
14

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,440
And this gives you that kind of grid layout pattern that makes your layout really flexible.
15

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,660
We're going to have a fourth child which is going to be a row, and this row is going to have a whole
16

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:26,270
bunch of children including an icon. Now an icon is a class that is drawn instead of being shown.
17

18
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,780
So for an image it's simply displayed as is.
18

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,390
But for an icon, it's actually drawing all of the sides and the edges onto the screen.
19

20
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,380
What this allows you to do, is you can on the fly for example, change the color of the icon or the size
20

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,420
of the icon.
21

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,910
And it's so much more flexible than simply just using an image.
22

23
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:56,000
And by using the material.dart package from Flutter, you already have access to a whole bunch of icons
23

24
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:03,690
that Google made. So, if you take a look at the documentation for the icons class, icons with an s, you
24

25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:11,880
can see that you have all of these icons at your fingertips. And they come from the material design icons.
25

26
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,750
So these are icons that designers at Google actually created, so you can have a consistent theme across
26

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,650
apps that are built with the material design look. The way that I prefer to browse icons is actually
27

28
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,310
using a tool called materialpalette.com.
28

29
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,250
And not only is this really good for coming up with really intelligent beautiful color palettes. So for
29

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:43,200
example on the main page, if you select two colors that you quite like, for example teal and yellow, then
30

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,530
it'll automatically generate you a eight-color color palette even complete with an accent tone. And you
31

32
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,730
can see it looks really really nice straight up from the get go. And it also has the colors that we've
32

33
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,820
been using so far and gives you their names all in one place.
33

34
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,200
And if you click on them, it'll show you all the various shades that you can tap into.
34

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,170
There's also a third tab which are the icons. And it's a really easily searchable place where you can
35

36
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,640
say let's look for an add icon, and it shows you here are all the ones that you could possibly use.
36

37
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,950
And when you find one of them, you can see it has a name.
37

38
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,520
Right.
38

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,930
This one's called add_shopping.cart. So I can simply go into my Flutter app and write icons, which
39

40
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,650
is the name of the class that supports material design icons.
40

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,000
.add_shopping_cart. And now, almost immediately, you can see that I can add that icon that I found on
41

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,750
here to my app. Which is brilliant,
42

43
00:03:51,750 --> 00:04:00,270
if you don't want to spend a lot of time finding or creating or paying for these design resources.
43

44
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,750
Now I mentioned that icons are better than images because they're drawn on the fly.
44

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,100
So let me show you what you can do with these icons that you can't do with images.
45

46
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,730
I can for example turn that icon into a much larger icon by simply changing its size property.
46

47
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:26,590
So let's make it 100, and you can see that almost immediately, my icon becomes super large and the
47

48
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,100
lines get thicker and it scales until infinity.
48

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,520
So if I change this to 1000, you'll see that it won't pixelate because it's actually just drawn.
49

50
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,910
All that happens, is that it goes off the screen, and you get these yellow bars as a warning to tell you
50

51
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,580
that there's parts of your content that's not visible to the user. It's completely off the screen but you
51

52
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,120
can see that this icon doesn't become pixelated, whereas if I did that to my image up here.
52

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:03,250
So let's say I make that circle avatar 1000 in its radius. Then you can see that my picture becomes a
53

54
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,810
little bit pixelated. And let's go a little bit more extreme,
54

55
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,800
let's add another zero to that, and now it's completely not interpretable.
55

56
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,330
I can't really tell what that is anymore even though I know it's her.
56

57
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,030
This is the reason why icons are much better because they're vectors, and you can even change their color
57

58
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,240
on the fly.
58

59
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:30,380
Let's change the color of my icon to that teal color that we've been using. Just save
59

60
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,040
and you can see it now blurs into the background. But if I change that into a 900 shade, and it save, then
60

61
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,620
you'll see it become a much darker teal.
61

62
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,980
And now it's completely visible.
62

63
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,140
So you can change the color of it.
63

64
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,600
You can change the size of it.
64

65
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,490
You can do all sorts of things with these icons that you can't do with images.
65

66
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,530
And this is why they're really really useful inside your app.
66

67
00:05:59,530 --> 00:05:59,800
All right.
67

68
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,200
So the icon that we actually want here is the one called phone.
68

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,890
And this one gives us that little phone icon that we can put next to some piece of text.
69

70
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:19,780
So in addition to the icon, I'm also going to have some text and this is simply going to be a phone number.
70

71
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,720
So +44 123 456 789 for example.
71

72
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,170
And then I'm going to style up my text because at the moment it looks a bit boring.
72

73
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:40,690
So I'm going to give it a text style. And this is going to have a color which is going to be a dark teal
73

74
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,010
color.
74

75
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:49,510
So colors.teal.shade900 and then it's going to have a font family of the same one
75

76
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,150
that we've been using which is Source Sans
76

77
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:01,610
Pro. And we can change the font size to 20 points, and let's hit save and see what that looks like.
77

78
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,840
All right.
78

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,920
So that looks pretty nice but it'd be nice if there was a little bit of space between the icon and the
79

80
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,640
text right.
80

81
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,510
Well we know that we are inside a row, and the way that we can easily add space between our children
81

82
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,840
in our rows, is by adding a sized box.
82

83
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:25,160
So we're going to add a sized box and we're going to give it some dimension in the horizontal axis.
83

84
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,420
Right.
84

85
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,600
Because we're in a row, so it's going to go from left to right.
85

86
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,710
So we'll give it a width, and let's give it a width of maybe 10 points.
86

87
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,890
And that should be enough to separate those out a little bit.
87

88
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,620
Make it look just that bit nicer.
88

89
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,890
So finally I'm going to give my container a color just so that it will show up as a separate piece of
89

90
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,210
information, from the rest of my widgets.
90

91
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:59,200
So let's give this a color of white, and let's hit save, and now I have to change my icon back into teal
91

92
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,890
so that it's visible. And I can make it come away from the edges of the screen a little bit by adding
92

93
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,110
margin.
93

94
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:14,440
So a lot of the widgets inside Flutter will have margin or padding as properties that you can change.
94

95
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,780
And they all work exactly the same way as we saw earlier with the columns and the rows.
95

96
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,410
We use edgeinsets and I'm going to add edgeinsets only that are different for the top and bottom and
96

97
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,950
also left and right.
97

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,460
So I'm going to use some metric. And I'm going to say that the vertical sides, so the top and bottom, are
98

99
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:44,400
going to have 10 points of margin and the horizontal is going to have 25 points of margin.
99

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,190
Now you can see that our container comes away a little bit from the edges, and it looks just a little
100

101
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,810
bit better. And our container also has padding.
101

102
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:05,450
So let's add maybe 10 pixels of padding to all four sides. And now we have our little card.
102

103
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,250
Right.
103

104
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:13,290
As a challenge I want you to create the other container. The one where you have your email address and
104

105
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,430
an email icon.
105

106
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,880
So I want to challenge you to use the Flutter documentation, and also what you learned in this lesson
106

107
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,800
to create that second card. Pause the video, and give that a go now. OK,
107

108
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,980
so we know that we need another container.
108

109
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,340
Right.
109

110
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,860
It's pretty much the same as this one.
110

111
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,580
So let's find out where our container ends.
111

112
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,900
It's right about here.
112

113
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,730
And let's go ahead and collapse it. And then we're going to add another container underneath it.
113

114
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,590
And this one is also going to have the same amount of padding,
114

115
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,520
so that was edgeinsets all with 10 points.
115

116
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:06,900
And then it's going to have a margin of symmetric margin with 10 on the vertical, and 25 on the horizontal.
116

117
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,740
And finally it's going to have some content and the content is going to be under the child property
117

118
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,090
and it's going to be a row that we want to create.
118

119
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:24,440
The row is going to have some children. And these children include, one a icon that comes from the icons
119

120
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,770
class. And you can either scroll through this to find an icon that looks right.
120

121
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:37,110
But in this case it's going to be email. Or you can take a look at the websites that we spoke about earlier
121

122
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,180
on.
122

123
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:45,000
Now that I have my e-mail icon in there, I'm going to change the styling of that icon to make it look
123

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,700
a bit more like the other one.
124

125
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:57,360
So I have to change its color to teal. And then I get to add my text which can really say anything you
125

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,430
want it to.
126

127
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:06,480
But in my case I'm going to add maybe an email. Let's say angela@email.com. And then I'm going
127

128
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:17,220
to change its style to have a text style, and maybe we'll go for a font size of 20 to match with the
128

129
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,010
other one, a color of teal 900
129

130
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:36,630
and the font family is of course also going to be Source Sans Pro. Let's hit save and let's see if we
130

131
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,400
get what we wanted.
131

132
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,030
OK.
132

133
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,520
So we can see that the icon has disappeared.
133

134
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
So it's the same color as the background.
134

135
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:49,200
We've got our text formatted in the same way as the previous one, and all we have to do now is to give
135

136
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:58,760
our container a white background and it should show up underneath the other one and show us what else
136

137
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,570
is missing.
137

138
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:06,080
So the only thing that looks odd to me is just a little bit of space between the icon and the text.
138

139
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,310
So to do that we have to add our Sized Box with a width,
139

140
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,250
and that was going to be 10.
140

141
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,420
And now if we hit save, then it's starting to look pretty good. In the next lesson,
141

142
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:28,440
we're going to finalize this app, and we're gonna make these in those actions a little bit nicer looking
142

143
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,500
using a Flutter widget called card.
143

144
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,580
So for all of that and more, I'll see on the next lesson.
