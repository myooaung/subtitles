00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.250
All right. Load up on the coffee because we're going to get started making the Xylophone app.
1

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.060
And in this app we're going to be diving deeper into Dart programming, which also means that we'll have
2

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.870
to build an app with far more functionality.
3

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.480
And so by the end of the module, not only will you understand some key concept in Dart programming, but
4

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.170
also we're going to be looking at how we can use a Flutter packages,
5

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.460
so open source packages of code, to level up our app and make it have even more functionality without
6

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910
having to spend months and months coding it up.
7

8
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.550
So I hope you're as excited as I am to get started on this module because it's jam-packed and it's going
8

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.670
to be really fun.
9

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.780
And by the end of the module, this is what you'll build. You'll build a music app which allow you to play
10

11
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.220
sounds. Or if you're super talented, then you'll actually be able to play a real song.
11

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.380
The starting project as always is on Github and you'll find the link to this repository in the course
12

13
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.550
resources.
13

14
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.020
And as always, we're going to clone our app onto our local system by checking it out from version control.
14

15
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.830
Now let's paste our URL in, and click clone. And once that's done,
15

16
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.710
as always, we're going to say no to Android Studio creating an Android project for us.
16

17
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.930
Instead we're going to open it up as a Flutter project.
17

18
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.450
So we're going to go over to where we cloned it which in my case was under Android Studio projects, going
18

19
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.710
to click on the folder that contains our project xylophone-flutter.
19

20
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.740
We're going to click open to open it up. Now,
20

21
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.240
as always, we start off with loads of errors but we can get rid of all of those just by clicking on get
21

22
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.370
dependencies, and it fetches all the things that makes a Flutter app a Flutter app.
22

23
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.030
And once it's done, in 4.8 seconds, then it will be able to recognize all of our Flutter
23

24
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.640
code and all our errors go away.
24

25
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.900
Now feel free to run the app if you need to, but you can pretty much see that this is just a empty scaffold.
25

26
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.080
We've got a body which has a container that's contained within a safe area so that it doesn't bleed
26

27
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.530
out to the edges.
27

28
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.300
The only thing that we've added to this project is a folder called assets. And inside that folder, we've
28

29
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.350
got seven sounds and these will be the seven sounds that are Xylophone app will
29

30
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.880
be able to play. Now the sound files are added to our project in exactly the same way that we added our
30

31
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.950
image files.
31

32
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.920
We went into the pubspec.yaml configuration folder,
32

33
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.440
we specified that our Flutter project requires some local assets so some local files that we're going
33

34
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.190
to use inside our project, and then we specified the folder under which it's contained. And this folder
34

35
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.990
is of course called assets.
35

36
00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.180
So previously we had an images folder so it looked like this, but now we have an assets folder and a
36

37
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.500
little bit later on, we're going to find out why we named it this.
37

38
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.780
But essentially what I'm trying to show you is that when you add sound files or when you add text files
38

39
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.930
or when you add image files, it's all done in the same way. You create a folder, you drag in those files,
39

40
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.160
you create an assets entry under your Flutter app and you specify the name of the folder where your
40

41
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.510
assets exist.
41

42
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.110
This is the same for images and it's the same for sounds.
42

43
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.380
Now if you want to run the app just to see what it looks like, feel free to do so.
43

44
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.020
But once you're done with setup we're going to get started building out our Xylophone app.
