00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,460
In this lesson we're going to do the final piece of setup to use Firebase and that's adding the Firebase
1

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,700
packages to our project.
2

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,310
After all, the reason Firebase is easy to use is because we're going to be using their classes and their
3

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,900
code as a starting point.
4

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,630
I'll be showing you how to do this for both Android and iOS
5

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,320
in this lesson. The latter part of this lesson is going to include some iOS specific instructions
6

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,720
so just skip the last part of this lesson
7

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,600
if you're developing on windows.
8

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:39,000
Now once we've added our iOS  and Android apps to Firebase, then it's time to actually incorporate the Flutter
9

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,370
packages that will allow us to work with Firebase using Dart.
10

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,860
As I mentioned before, there's a whole bunch of Firebase services that we could be using. But in our case
11

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,640
were only using two of these which is authentication and cloud_firestore.
12

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,500
So if you click on these links, then it'll take you to the relevant flflutter package on the dartlang
13

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,610
pub page. And whenever you're working with anything from Firebase, you'll always need to start by adding
14

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,880
firebase_core.
15

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,350
It's the one that all of these other packages are going to depend on.
16

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,720
So let's first install firebase_core into our pubspec. So let's go into Installing and I'm just gonna
17

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,340
copy this dependency as it is and I'm going to be adding it to the pubspec.yaml file.
18

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,850
So just below are animated text kit
19

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,920
I'm gonna add the firebase_core and then we'll add the firebase_auth.
20

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,990
Now at the time when you're looking at this, these numbers might have changed but just take whatever
21

22
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,110
it is that you see there and you can paste it into our pubspec folder  just so that you get the latest
22

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,890
versions.
23

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,000
All right.
24

25
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,880
So now that we're done adding all of our dependencies, we're ready to go ahead and hit up packages get
25

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,870
to incorporate all of those things into our project. Once that's done,
26

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,820
it's really important to test our app on iOS
27

28
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:15,150
if you're testing on iOS and also Android. And it's important to test it from a cold start.
28

29
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,540
So we're going to click stop to stop all the processes that are happening which means that all our apps
29

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,560
will exit on Android and on iOS. And now we're going to start with Android and we're going to click Run
30

31
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,050
to build our app from fresh.
31

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,460
So after the usual deprecation warnings that we're getting here, we should be getting our APK which
32

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,100
is our Android file being built.
33

34
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:50,640
And if we take a look at our emulator, we should be looking at a working version of our app as it is.
34

35
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,400
So this is success and we're now ready to test the iOS linking up.
35

36
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,360
So it's really important that you test things at this stage because later on as we add more code, different
36

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,620
things can go wrong.
37

38
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,820
And if you leave it too late, it might just not work.
38

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,210
So once you're done with the Android testing, go ahead and choose your iOS simulator or device. And before
39

40
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:20,960
you hit run, one of the things I recommend you to do is to go into this tab in Android Studio called
40

41
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,820
the terminal. And here we're going to update CocoaPods.
41

42
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,820
Now in the very very beginning of the course, we installed CocoaPods but it's been many many moons ago
42

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,720
and there might have been a newer version out.
43

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,910
So it's really important that after you add those Firebase packages to your pubspec file that you first
44

45
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,200
do an update on CocoaPods before you run it for iOS otherwise terrible things might happen and we might
45

46
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,050
have to figure out how to fix it, if that is the case.
46

47
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,450
Prevention is better than cure.
47

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:04,880
So first things first, we're going to update our pod repo so we're going to put pod repo update and this
48

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,960
grabs the latest versions for our CocoaPods.
49

50
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,870
And that might take a little while but it should be done after a minute or two.
50

51
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,410
Now the thing I didn't mention is that I'm going to be cutting out and speeding up many part of this
51

52
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,090
because it can take a while especially updating CocoaPods.
52

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,810
It is something that can be a little bit time consuming but hey all good things are worth waiting for
53

54
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,730
right? Now once it's done you should see your prompt, so that dollar sign, and the name of your user.
54

55
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:43,300
So this is now done. And now we're ready to move onto the next step of updating CocoaPods which is going
55

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,600
to be sudo gem install cocoapods.
56

57
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,250
And this is going to take even longer
57

58
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,320
and if you're using sudo which means super user do, we're going to have to enter the admin password,
58

59
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:04,990
so the password that you use to log onto your Mac to access your computer. Now because I've already updated
59

60
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,440
very very recently, it's not doing a lot of work and it finished after about five seconds.
60

61
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,690
But this can take anywhere, I've seen in the past students, take anywhere between five seconds and five
61

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,230
hours.
62

63
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,470
So it really is something that can take a while.
63

64
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,900
You just have to be patient, it hasn't crashed.
64

65
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,870
Just let it go on until it's done.
65

66
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,880
And once it's done, you'll see your user name and the dollar sign or the prompt again and we're ready
66

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,720
to do the final part which is just to run pod setup. And this should just do all the sort of behind the
67

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,620
scenes linking up.
68

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,790
And once that's done
69

70
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,520
it'll tell you that it's done and it'll say setup completed. Now if at any point during this process
70

71
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:56,000
you see some red text in here instead of green or yellow or white, then make sure you dive deeper into
71

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,370
those error messages or google for it or usually they'll give you a hint as to what's going on. But everything
72

73
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,420
going well there shouldn't be any problems
73

74
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,690
and we're now ready to shrink down our terminal and go ahead and stop our app and run it on iOS.
74

75
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:19,100
So let's go ahead and hit run and let's see what happens.
75

76
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,590
So now that's complete.
76

77
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,410
And even though we've got quite a few messages in here coming from the Firebase packages, we've got our
77

78
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,850
app up and running and it's all going well even if it did take quite a while.
78

79
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,830
Now notice how we're running pod install and that's Flutter which is initiating that to be able to
79

80
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,310
install all of these packages as cocoapods to our iOS app.
80

81
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,920
Now if you encounter any errors at any point be sure to refer to the course resources where I'll provide
81

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,440
a link to some of the most common errors that you'll see when trying to incorporate Firebase to your
82

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,210
Flutter app.
83

84
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,160
And I've got some good solutions for those things.
84

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,880
But the best way is just to follow this lesson step by step closely.
85

86
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,170
This is the easiest way to have the smoothest experience and if you do encounter any issues, it might be
86

87
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,290
worth reviewing the videos and some of those steps that you might have missed out.
87

88
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:23,260
But once you've confirmed that your app can run from cold start on iOS as and Android, if you're testing
88

89
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,990
on both, then you're ready to proceed to the next step where we actually get started registering some
89

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,860
of our users.
90

91
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,710
So all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
