00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.580
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.980
So before we get started, I wanted to quickly run through just what a Flutter app is composed of; or the
2

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.860
anatomy of a Flutter app.
3

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.520
And we're going to decompose it. And we're going to break it down.
4

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.840
So, as I mentioned before, everything inside a Flutter app is a widget. And you build widgets upon widgets
5

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.620
just like Lego blocks on Lego blocks in order to create your app.
6

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.660
So let's say that we decided to create a brand new app.
7

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.280
The first thing we might do is we might create a scaffold.
8

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.770
And this is just a blank screen for our app.
9

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.490
And inside the scaffold, we're going to add an app bar at the top.
10

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.220
And this is a pre-built widget that simply looks like an app bar and acts like an app bar.
11

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.830
And it's also super easy to create.
12

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.760
Now, the other thing I'm going to put into my scaffold is a container. And this container is just a box
13

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.350
and it's going to contain the content of my app.
14

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
Now, the container is going to have a column.
15

16
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.410
So this is a column.
16

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.950
And so now we can put widgets inside the column that stack vertically.
17

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.300
So, for example, the first thing I might put into my column - at the top - is a row.
18

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.730
And the second thing is - I might put in - a piece of text.
19

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.790
So now I have a column with two items - with two widgets: a row at the top and some text at the bottom.
20

21
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.940
Now I can go deeper into my widget tree. And in my row, I'm going to add some text and an icon. So when
21

22
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.660
I want widgets to be positioned vertically - one on top of the other - then I'll use a column to lay them
22

23
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.860
out.
23

24
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.780
If I want widgets to be side by side horizontally, then I'll use a row.
24

25
00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.610
And if I wanted to add in a piece of text, then I would use a text widget. If I wanted to add an icon,
25

26
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.650
then I would use an icon widget. If I want to add an image,
26

27
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.510
then I would use an image widget.
27

28
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.740
So you get the point.
28

29
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.360
And by the end of building our app, we end up with a widget tree like what you see on the right here
29

30
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.550
Now, our widget tree is just a whole bunch of widgets that are nested within each other.
30

31
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.010
And if we were to look at the code for our widget tree, it would look kind of similar, although it would
31

32
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.770
be rotated, I guess.
32

33
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.240
But essentially we would have all of our widgets nested inside each other.
33

34
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.880
So inside these parentheses for the scaffold, we've got an app bar and a container: an app bar and a container.
34

35
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.210
Now, inside the parentheses for the container
35

36
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.600
So here's where it starts.
36

37
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.080
And here is where it ends.
37

38
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.960
Then we have a column. Here's our column. 
Inside our column
38

39
00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.010
we have two things: a row and some text. And inside our row, we have another two things:
39

40
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.980
some text and some icon. And this is how you would represent this tree or this design in Dart code. So
40

41
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.130
creating a user interface like the one we have here is as simple as writing a few lines of code like
41

42
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.630
this.
42

43
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.960
Now, while a lot of these widgets that we've seen so far are basically UI widgets, right? Their functionality
43

44
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.380
is mainly to either lay things out or to show pieces of text or icons.
44

45
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.400
Now there's also other widgets that have some functionality.
45

46
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.660
For example, if inside the column - instead of showing a piece of text - I wanted to show a picture from
46

47
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.280
the Internet.
47

48
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.840
Well, I can then use a widget called a network image and I'll give it a U.R.L. and it'll be able to load
48

49
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.930
the image from that URL address.
49

50
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.860
So this is a widget that performs a little bit of functionality.
50

51
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.010
And so the way I like to think of it is: when you're building Flutter apps, it's kind of like working
51

52
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.180
with Lego Technic. Because while traditional Lego is mostly just about building blocks on top of each
52

53
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.870
other to create ... well, all I created was pyramids.
53

54
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.010
It was the easiest thing to do, so I made a lot of pyramids.
54

55
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.170
I wasn't creative enough to make much else ... but with Lego Technic you can build something that not only
55

56
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.070
looks good, but also has functionality.
56

57
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.010
For example, this truck here. We've got a little remote control and you can move the crane arm up and
57

58
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.180
down. And this is because not only does it have the Lego pieces or the widgets for the appearance, such
58

59
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.670
as wheels or the front bumper or the crane, but it also has the pieces that give it functionality, like
59

60
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.610
a motor or a battery.
60

61
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.610
And it's through plugging all of these pieces together, you end up with something that not only looks
61

62
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.200
beautiful, but is also interactive.
62

63
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.980
And that is essentially what our Flutter apps are and how they will get built through the use of all
63

64
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.650
of these different types of widgets.
64

65
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:21.110
So, once you're ready, let's get started and set up and download our tools so that we can get started developing
65

66
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.820
our very own Flutter apps! For all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
