00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:06,370
In this lesson I'm going gonna show you a sample solution for creating all our drop down menu items
1

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,750
in one go by using loops. Either
2

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,270
you've used what you've already known about FOR loops or you've watched the last lesson and you've now
3

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,520
learned all about Dart FOR loops.
4

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,960
But either way we're going to solve this challenge of taking our list of currencies and converting them
5

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,370
into a drop down menu items with text widgets with value properties.
6

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:40,460
We're going to insert the value of each of those items inside our currency list into one of these widgets
7

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,340
right up here.
8

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm going to create a new method and I'm going to call it getDropDownItems and it's going to have
9

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,780
no inputs but it's going to carry out some functionality.
10

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,660
Now mind you, your particular implementation might differ from the sample solution that I'm providing
11

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,320
and that's okay.
12

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,430
Your code and my code doesn't have to match one to one.
13

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,440
If your code works, it works and that's what counts.
14

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:16,120
So first let me show you an implementation using the C style FOR loop where we create a FOR  loop and
15

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:25,720
we create an integer called i, set it equal to zero and then we say that while i is less than the length
16

17
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:32,640
of our currency's list so for as many items as we've got in here, we could loop through it.
17

18
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,690
And to access our currency's list of course we have to import our coin data.
18

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,320
So import coin_data.dart.
19

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,320
And now we can see while i is less than currenciesList.length,
20

21
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,400
so how many values are there in that list,
21

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:58,090
then we're going to increment i by 1 each time to loop through all of the items in that list of currencies.
22

23
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,210
Now I can print i and see how many times this loop is going to run.
23

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,650
Let's call this function in our build method so that it runs every time we hot reload our app.
24

25
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,410
So I'm going to call get dropdown items and I'm gonna hit save.
25

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,950
So it runs that code and you can see that it runs it from 0 until 20.
26

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,690
So there's basically 21 items in my currency's list.
27

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,580
Now instead of just printing out i, I can print out the currenciesList, so my list, and then I can provide
28

29
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,020
i as the index.
29

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:42,010
So now if I hit save again, what will get printed are each of my currencies in my list of currencies.
30

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,140
And it loops through all of them until it gets to the very end.
31

32
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,070
And now what I can do is I could use this,
32

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:59,800
so let's create a new string called currency and I can let it equal currencies list at index i, and I
33

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,880
could create a new drop down menu item and the child is going to be a text widget which is going to
34

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,270
contain that currency as the string.
35

36
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:16,090
And also I'm going to set that value property to also be that currency string.
36

37
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:23,400
Now I can save this drop down menu item that I've created inside the FOR loop inside a new variable
37

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,330
we'll just call it a newItem, set it to equal to that.
38

39
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:40,000
And outside of the loop, I can create a list of widgets and this list is going to be called my drop down
39

40
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,840
items and it's going to start out being an empty list.
40

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,710
Now every time we create a new item, we're going to add it to our dropdown items,
41

42
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:58,630
so dropdown items.add and the new widget is going to be that new item that we created inside the
42

43
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,820
FOR loop.
43

44
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,420
So now you can see that we've created a empty dropdown list.
44

45
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:12,100
We loop through our currencies list and for every currency that's in the list, we create a new drop down
45

46
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,240
menu item.
46

47
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,330
And inside there we create a text widget where we insert that currency and we also insert it here.
47

48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,340
And once that widget's been created, we add it to our list of dropdown items.
48

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,140
So now once my FOR loop has run for every single one of my currencies, so I should have 21 dropdown
49

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,930
items in this list,
50

51
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,220
well then I can return this list as the output of this method.
51

52
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:49,680
So I'm gonna return the dropdown items and I'm gonna change the return type from void to a list of drop
52

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:59,790
down menu items. And we should also change this dropdown items list to rather be a generic list of widgets
53

54
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:08,340
to be a list of drop down menu items. And even more specifically, it's actually a list of drop down menu
54

55
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,510
items that will contain strings as their child.
55

56
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,980
So now that we've created this method which is going to get our drop down menu items, well we can use
56

57
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,450
it down here where we specify the items in our dropdown button.
57

58
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:32,100
So instead of having this hard-coded list where we wrote out by hand each of our drop down menu items
58

59
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:39,240
what we can now call get dropdown items, and if we had save and we take a look at our app, you can see
59

60
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,320
now when we click on our dropdown list, it's got a drop down menu item for each of the currencies in
60

61
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,250
our coin data file. So we can now click on any of these and we can select them and print them into the
61

62
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,520
console.
62

63
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,900
Now some of you might have chosen a slightly easier way of creating this functionality because instead
63

64
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,540
of using a standard C style FOR loop, we could also use a for in loop.
64

65
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,780
And let me show you how much easier that looks.
65

66
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:21,510
So instead of using int i etc. We're going to create a new string value for each of the currencies inside
66

67
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,250
our currencies list.
67

68
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,890
And so now we don't have to create this variable here anymore.
68

69
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,450
It's already been created inside the conditions for our for in loop. Now that we have access to this
69

70
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,100
thing called currency which is going to equal each of the currencies in the list.
70

71
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:45,170
We can now use it to create our drop down menu items and we can add them to our dropdown items.
71

72
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,510
This does exactly the same thing but using less lines of code.
72

73
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,730
Did you manage to complete this challenge?
73

74
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,880
Well if not be sure to take a look through the last lesson where we covered the various types of FOR 
74

75
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,910
loops in Dart.
