Hey.
1

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,120
Well done for completing yet another module. These modules are getting longer and longer and more and more
2

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,190
hard, and harder and harder.
3

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,430
So by getting here you've really shown what you're made of.
4

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,490
Not everybody makes it this far.
5

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,130
Now, while you're here, I want to share with you something that I've noticed about how I procrastinate.
6

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm sure everybody procrastinates,
7

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:40,640
but one of the things that really struck me is, when I used to have to revise or study for med school,
8

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:48,780
one of the things I always did is, before I sat down to actually do the work, I wanted to prepare the
9

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,800
scene, I wanted to tidy my desk,
10

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:01:00,780
I wanted to sharpen my pencils, to make myself a cup of tea, maybe have like a little snack ready. And
11

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
what I realized is that I was just basically delaying like the actual work.
12

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,370
And it was just another form of procrastination.
13

14
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:20,250
And once I realized that, it also made me think that, you know, by doing all of these little things, like
14

15
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:29,070
feeding into your perfectionism or your OCD or getting yourself a snack beforehand or just like all
15

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:37,440
of this prep before doing the actual work, it was always like I was rewarding myself for procrastinating
16

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,870
and procrastination.
17

18
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,240
There's a lot of studies have been done on it and it shows like it's almost like addiction.
18

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,660
It's a.
19

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:56,320
It works so similarly in the human brain to an addiction, in the sense that like, you know, the more you
20

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,180
feed it the stronger it gets, the more dependent you become on procrastinating.
21

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,620
So one of the best ways is to just not feed it.
22

23
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,070
Imagine it as this sort of monster that you have to really break away from.
23

24
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,290
So ever since I realized that, what I did, instead of sort of doing all of these little things beforehand,
24

25
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,300
is I just got started.
25

26
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:31,000
And once I was done, once I did the work that I wanted to do, be it revising for an hour or studying something
26

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,870
for an hour,
27

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,100
itâ€™s at that point that I reward myself, that I get myself a snack or I find something
28

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,360
fun to do for like five minutes.
29

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:51,400
And this really helped me like beat procrastination. And one of the ways that you can try is something
30

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,940
called the Pomodoro Technique.
31

32
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,560
So you set the timer for twenty five minutes.
32

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,370
You do the tasks that you're meant to do and then after that time when the timer rings you have a five
33

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,040
minute break.
34

35
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,250
And in that five minutes you can do whatever it is you want,
35

36
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:15,310
right, like you can, you know, like go for a walk, go for a snack, look outside the window, go on like your
36

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,580
computer, search for something.
37

38
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,190
And the point is that you're delaying all of these fiddly things or all of these little itty bitty things
38

39
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,870
for that five minutes.
39

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,170
So while you're working you're fully focused on working and while you're having a break you're fully
40

41
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,590
focused on having a really relaxing break.
41

42
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,120
So have a go of that.
42

43
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:44,490
If you've never tried the Pomodoro Technique, it's pretty pretty big for me anyways.
43

44
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,590
And I'm really curious how it works out for you.
44

45
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,580
So either let me know in the Q & As, or let me know on Twitter, @yu_angela, how it's
45

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,090
going for you and what are some of your tricks as well.
46

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,230
I'm curious to know.
47

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,680
So keep going in the course and I will be silently cheering for you here.
