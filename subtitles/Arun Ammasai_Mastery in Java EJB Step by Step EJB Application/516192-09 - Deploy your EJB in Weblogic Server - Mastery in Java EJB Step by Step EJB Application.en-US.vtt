00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.980
Welcome back.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.420
So now we have Eclipse ready and making other server AD everything in place,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.985
all we need to do, create some business logic and deployed and test it out.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:13.335
So that is the first step.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.075
So we're going to create a simple method.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:19.410
For example, just pass a simple input and just print it.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.130
And then we'll move on to the advanced concepts and we'll talk about

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.390
what is there different types of being stateless, stateful.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.840
We'll talk about that in separate first,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.445
let's try a simple example.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.905
So here we have is when, right?

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:34.140
So this is where we're going to implement something here.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.650
So let's create a method here.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.255
I'm going to create a method called okay,

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.500
just to create a void and say, hi My God.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.660
So for this model, what we're gonna do,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.725
we're gonna pass input string name.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:54.680
So whenever this methyl is implementer way

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.025
how we are going to simply provide Hello Mr name.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.110
So here the moment I added a matter,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.450
you're obviously we'll end up with an issue here because we need to implement the method.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.780
So the amount that I'm trying to do Say hi,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.625
all I'm gonna do is simply provide assess for here and saying like,

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:19.925
Hello Mr. And the name as the input.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:21.455
So now what we need to do,

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.560
we need to deploy these into our WebLogic cellular.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.670
So before we're deploying,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.260
let me go back to the browser and I'll show you how the console looks like.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.065
So let's go back and here let's create new tab here.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:39.410
So the default is going to be local host seven and WO one console.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.360
So this is the control URL.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.895
So it's not up and running because if you go to Eclipse,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:48.140
we configured the server,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.715
but we haven't started yet.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:51.050
So first thing, right,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.160
like your server and stat.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.065
So you can see the console logs here.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:02.225
So once our server is up and running,

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:06.750
then we can go back and refresh the browser.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.205
Okay, so when the moment you saw the server is started in running mode.

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.430
So which means the saddle is up and running.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.060
So let's go back to the browser and just read over it one more time.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.015
See now it is asking that username and the password.

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:26.780
So I use an m is a WebLogic and we know the password, right.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.800
So it's up to you.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.390
What are the partial d which you created or which you mentioned when you create a domain.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.045
Okay, So this is a console and there are a lot of different options available here in,

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:42.895
around men deployment services.

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:46.660
And there are a lot different options here.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.295
So let's not worry about that.

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:48.880
For now.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.430
What we're going to talk about that the deployments,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.150
so this is the place where we can see all the deployments.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.895
So here I have at ACGME which I tried before,

00:02:57.895 --> 00:02:59.110
so I don't need that.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.175
So let's click and delete because we're going to deploy our new EAP here.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:05.785
So which is nothing but now what,

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:09.100
so what is happening here?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.350
Some Enter here. Anyway, it's,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.940
it's part of and deploying my services.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.730
Let's go back our server.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.515
So now in the deployment,

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:22.295
I don't have any deployments existence.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:23.645
Now what we're gonna do,

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:25.520
we have or management rights.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.645
Let's deploy this right-click and run this to run on the server,

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:36.290
which isn't our WebLogic server.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.990
And here, choose an existing Sarah

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.960
because we all are at the side of a right to just WALS server.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.325
And click Next.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.795
And it's already added here.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:46.700
So let's click Finish.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.470
So basically what happened?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.930
It automatically? What is the error here?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.190
Let's go back to the console.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.755
Okay, so depleted of him. Okay.

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:14.120
So let's go back to our console and refresh it one more time.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.780
And now you can see the Orman and don't worry about the error message because this

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.800
was created as part of the mind I'm trying to unemployed application, right?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.000
So there is some issue or this,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.025
that is why we got the error message.

00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:26.270
But the deployment is done.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.985
Now you should be able to see the order management here.

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:33.095
Okay, so now we have a A-GPS simple EGP,

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.090
and it is deployed in my server.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.310
So what are the next thing which we need to do b,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.235
how to create this declined to

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:45.680
test our application on our simple math that so basically what we need to do is,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.030
so this particular API has been deployed in your WebLogic server.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.610
First thing, we need to look up the WebLogic Sarah,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.725
because in the server you might have a lot of

00:04:54.725 --> 00:04:57.275
different Egypt is deployed at the same point of time.

00:04:57.275 --> 00:05:00.500
You need to tell reach Egypt we are trying to

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.845
look for that is why the map name coming into the picture.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.020
So based on this particular map and name,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.815
it will pick the EGP instance from your web server and then we can call them methods.

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:15.510
Let's do that in the next video.
