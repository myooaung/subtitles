00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.140
So now we have a beam which contains

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.410
a simple method and it is deployed in our loop logic server.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.885
So all we need to do is just create a test client and then we'll test it out.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:15.120
So since it's a mapping project,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.420
we should be able to see SRC main test.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.690
The reason it's not available here because when we create this mountain project,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.435
we did not choose the test models.

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:30.075
Anyway. We can add it later point of time.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:36.175
For now, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a new glass frame here.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:39.005
So not in the beans.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.545
Let's create a package called Auto Management test.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:51.860
And here, or we can call them as being client.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.475
Okay, So let's click Finish now.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.445
Okay, so now we have our session when ready.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.320
So what are the first thing which we need to do?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.705
Step 1, get initial context.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.455
So this particular get initial contacts.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:16.190
It will give you the context information.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.010
I bought your WebLogic server.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.540
And then using that context of the can look up our own EGP in it.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.830
So which means whenever you are getting initial contact,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.830
which meant it will give you the entire deployment information.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.950
Whatever the application is deployed in your writing server,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.155
it will be given to your initial context.

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:45.445
From the initial cart, you can assume that the initial contact S is a map.

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:48.850
So we did the map, you're trying to pass your EGP map

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.365
the name and get that particular instance alone.

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:55.015
So that is what we're gonna do it now.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:59.665
So first metabolite and I have the code copy, copy it before.

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:03.890
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna just simply copy paste it here because I've been at cold.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.195
It might take for a while.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:06.440
So what I'm gonna do,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.960
I'm gonna create a method here.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.360
So get initial context,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.085
naming context in then.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:19.010
Okay, so just how I look at this particular method.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.560
So in this initial context matter,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.410
we're creating a property and we're adding some information.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.425
And the first thing, so what is the initial context factory?

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:31.055
Because I'm using a WebLogic initial context factory.

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.785
This will be at different foreign, different servers.

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.545
If you're using J buzz, it might be a different one.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:38.435
And what is the provider you are?

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:43.475
This is nothing but I'm using a local host and 7,

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.545
0, 1. Do you remember?

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:50.675
So this is the provided URL.

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.795
So add my WebLogic server is configured

00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:58.220
and to access the information from the WebLogic server,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.830
I need to have the username and the password information that has

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.890
been provided in the security principle and the credential.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.470
Okay, so now it has all the information,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.260
which means it can go to this URL using

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.560
the username and password Click it can retrieve the initial context factory.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.180
So now that's step number 2.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.990
Fetch your EGP.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.610
Okay, so far now what I'm gonna do,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.605
I'm gonna create a main method here.

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:28.985
So instead the main matter,

00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:32.999
Let's create a context, context.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.045
Context as they could to get initial context.

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:39.860
So now we have the,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.540
anyway it will throw an exception.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.020
So I'm going to provide throws exception here.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.125
Okay?

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:49.790
So the next thing,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.830
so I have a context.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.715
The context I need to look up a name.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:58.580
So what is the name I'm trying to look up.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.310
So this is where the map name comes into a picture.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.950
So let's go back here.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.480
So what is our mapper name?

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.490
This is the lookup name,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.270
so this will be available in the WebLogic server instance.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.130
So I'm going to look up,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.545
sorry, I'm going to look up this.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:22.700
And you need to provide as symbol here.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.350
And after that you need to provide water,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.020
the interface which is used to expose.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.450
So what are the interface? We know that, right?

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.355
So this is an interface test session being remote.

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:38.885
And now what I'm going to do, I'm going to copy the name, copy qualified name.

00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:45.435
And here what I'm gonna do is let's come back here and provide the package com.org.

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:49.205
Management means test decision being remote.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.820
Okay, So this particular lookup

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.270
will provide you this session being a remote as an interface.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.620
So when you have the interface,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.915
which means you can call the methods in it.

00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:07.010
So what I'm gonna do is this entire portion is going to be something here.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.870
So what I'm gonna do, so instead of arms it,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.430
I'm going to retrieve ASA this session as a remote bean.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.955
We need to input it now.

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:16.310
So let me decrease the size here,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.020
or I can maximize this one.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.490
Okay, So it is Session mean, import it first.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.855
And you will get the type cast a shadow because we need to cast the information.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:33.200
Or either you can, you give us an object and then you can typecast it asks,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.420
well, that's still up to you.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.440
So now we have the lookup in our context and we retrieve the mapping name.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.080
So which means we can use a lookup and we can

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.840
call the method which is available in our bean,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.670
which it does say hi Matt that.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.910
So now what I'm gonna do, it's all right,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.900
let's go here and then lookup dot what are the materials you're going to use?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.670
Say hi Murdoch, I'm going to prove something like the input acid.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.360
Ha.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.415
So hello Mr. Ag.

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:13.220
So it will not look straight away.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.545
The reason we made a lot of changes, right?

00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:19.220
So we need to make sure we deploy the latest changes as well.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.915
So the next thing which we need to do,

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:26.450
right-click your application and then arenas server run on

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.615
your server because which will redeploy your application again into your logic, a server.

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:37.170
So click Next and Finish.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.120
Okay, So it is a diploid now.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.945
So all we need to do is just test it out.

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:51.535
So we have a client, right?

00:06:51.535 --> 00:06:57.370
So what we can do is now just right-click and run as a simple Java application.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.090
It, okay, So this is one of the input

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.180
and add a message whenever you're trying to call an Egypt metadata,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:11.455
you will get d initial context exception because your client needs a JAR file support,

00:07:11.455 --> 00:07:13.915
so which is available in your WebLogic server.

00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:17.454
For now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to add it manually.

00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:19.455
So here what we can do this,

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:23.510
go to properties and then go to the Build Path Java bill.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:30.575
But, and here you can add the ASA external jacks here.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.255
So add extra jobs,

00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:34.880
so deserve a slower rate.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.125
So another, so we have a lib folder and other lib folder we have

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:44.660
a file called WL thin T3, claim that Java.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.420
So T3 is a protocol because if you remember in

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.840
newer get initial contexts to be local for local host seven w1,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.265
which is a T3 protocol.

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:55.880
And I'm going to click this one and open.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.680
So it's added into our class,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.540
but apply and close.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.435
And let's refresh it one more time.

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:06.690
And then right-click and run it one more time.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.875
Run as Java application.

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:17.360
Yes, it is taking else you'll seconds because it has to look up,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.670
you're uploading server and then it has uploaded information.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.115
See now we got the output Hello Mr.

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:24.125
He, right?

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:27.470
So now we know how to create a simple method and then

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.175
how we can create a client and call them.

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:35.520
And we have seen the output as well here.
