00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.090
Welcome back. So that the blood in

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.390
several industrial nation has been done if you see the percentage coming to 10,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.740
20 to a 100.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
So now we have the WebLogic server is created in this location,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.530
which is our desktop.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.610
Let's open it.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.790
And here you can see I've a bloodless narrower here,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.800
but that wouldn't be Amy.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.945
Specific domains here.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:23.880
So if you're going into W obliging server,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.710
you won't find any specific domain.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.220
So whenever you create any WebLogic server,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.075
all you need to do is first you how to create your own a domain.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.615
So that is a domain which you are going to use for all our deployments.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:41.015
So how we can create our own diamond?

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.190
What do you need to do? Go to Article common and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.440
that we have a common folder answer the common folder,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.955
we have a bin directory,

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.640
and here we have a config file.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.090
So let's modify the view here so I can show you that.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.235
So configured as such here.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:56.600
So if you're using Windows,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.735
you should be able to say conflict that command file.

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:01.370
So since we are using Mac,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.260
I'm going to use the confident message fact.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.625
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:09.455
I'm going to this folder and then I will create a new domain.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:11.300
So let's see how we can do that.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.475
So rata my now I'm under the user and disrupt software.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.410
So what are the next thing which we need to do?

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.885
We need to go inside and WLS folder.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:23.075
So let's come back.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.100
So under that WAS folder,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.080
we have a folder called Oracle comments.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.015
So that is an experts which we needed to go.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.615
So Oracle comment.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.520
So under the article common,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.175
we have the common folder and then we have a big folder.

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:38.780
And here what we need to do,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.340
we need to execute the,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.855
the configured SSH fail.

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:46.565
So SS search space,

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:51.065
config dot SH enter.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:56.340
So eight will bring up a domain creation wizard.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.350
Okay, So it is open now.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.150
So what do we need to do?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.785
So create a new domain.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:05.315
And here if you take a look at it,

00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:07.040
this is the location where we have

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.420
our regular user already installed under the UDL project,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.830
I'm going to create my new domain,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.240
and it's going to be based domain.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.670
I'm going to keep the same name and click Next.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.115
Basically you don't have to do any much of a changes.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:23.550
You can keep the default settings here and click Next.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.405
And here you need to provide the username and the password.

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:33.995
Let's keep the WebLogic ASA username and you can create your own password here.

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.440
So it's going to be alphanumeric.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.965
So some secured password and keep,

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.390
and don't forget the password.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.820
So I can keep the development mode on.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.385
And I'm going to use the oracle 1.8.

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:53.015
So click Next and let's use all of them.

00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:56.165
Anyway, we are going to use a NodeManager just in case if you need in the future,

00:02:56.165 --> 00:03:00.035
I'm going to I'm going to keep everything and click Next.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:03.230
And then the server name is of admin solo Are you can rename it as well.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.885
And there is an airport is going to be seven devils 01.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.360
Let an address or low paradox,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.820
which means local host or your IP audio or MCA does everything can use

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:21.530
the same IP and click Next and then go to the next at Node Manager.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.790
So invalid username.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay, so since we click the Node Manager in the previous screen,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.225
we have to provide the username for managing our nodes.

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.310
So WebLogic, this is not required.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.610
But anyway, since I had chosen in the second screen,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.210
I have to provide a is an m password.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.500
And click next.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.685
Setting up It's, it,

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:51.035
it might take some time because these are the basic things which we need.

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:52.580
Because we don't the basic,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.320
we cannot proceed forward.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.910
We're not gonna get any a managed service here.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.340
So let's move on to the next screen and then we're not

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.205
going to work with any clusters and not templates.

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:06.980
And just keep clicking motion of the scenario.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.050
We're gonna keep the default options enabled and then click Create.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.110
It will create your own domain.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.265
So that is the domain which we are going to use in our Eclipse.

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:25.805
So it might take a few seconds or a few minutes based on your system memory.

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:28.550
And then it will create a domain for us.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.935
So the domain location which will be mentioned here,

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:37.200
user earn this trope and software and you can find the full path here.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.150
It started now. So I'm going to pass it for now.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.005
Also, deletes reached to a 100 percent ish.

00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:50.870
So now it is related to 91% Asian.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.925
Now it is almost finished.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.730
Let's give it a few more seconds. Yes, it is done.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.545
Click Next. And then here is the location.

00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:03.470
So users, I don't desktop software WALS one for level

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.545
one uses projects domain and based domain.

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:10.520
And this is my Admin URL for my WebLogic server.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.860
So now we have everything we need.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.195
So let's click finish.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:18.215
And then in the next video we'll create a project in our Eclipse.

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:19.860
Thank you.
