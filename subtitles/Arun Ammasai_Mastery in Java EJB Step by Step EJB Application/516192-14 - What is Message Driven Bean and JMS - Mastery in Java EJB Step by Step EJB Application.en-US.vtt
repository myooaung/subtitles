00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.975
Hello everyone.

00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:01.815
Welcome back.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:05.070
So we discuss about what is the EGP purse is 10, 10,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.890
what is the entity and the entity managers and persist

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.190
in unit and what a good data source and all.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.430
And we're going to upgrade

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.180
some persistent entities and we'll deal with the database operation.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.405
But before we have to do something else,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:26.785
the thing is we talked about the stateless and stateful session bit, right?

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:28.080
And along with the data,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.260
be one more different type of bean,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.770
which is a message driven Bain.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.320
Let's talk about what is our message driven bean.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.400
And then we will create a simple message driven bean.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.430
And then we will create a GMS queue.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.570
And you might be thinking,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.690
why do we need to have a GMS q and r, We'll talk about that.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.065
But we felt, let's see what is a message driven when just like

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:57.995
a normal assertion being stateless and stateful.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:01.430
Message driven when also contains the business logic.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.015
And it will be invoked by a pausing a message.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:08.870
Normally when we write as stateless and stateful session,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.660
when how we invoke the method is using a remote client or any taste clients.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.410
But if you're writing in Egypt,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.180
a message driven we need can be invoked by a message.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.620
So it's like a MDB as synchronously receives a message and process it.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.300
So someone anonymously posted a message to a particular portion and our Egypt

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.820
will always listen into

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.780
the port and then once the message receiver to start processing it.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.750
And who can pose the information to the MDB or where the MDB

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.225
is listening to the messages which will be coming from Q on a topic.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:49.670
For this particular session,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.770
we're going to use the queue.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.435
You're not going to use topic.

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:55.640
Okay, So in order to create a queue,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.910
we need to have some basic understanding about a GMS.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.030
So Java messaging services,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.130
so we can create a j.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.665
M is a queue in our WebLogic server.

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:08.345
And before we do that,

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:10.745
we need to understand few terminologies.

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:16.280
So what are the important key factors which is required for j m?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.430
First thing, Union a JVM server,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.070
and then you need a DJ EMS module and then the SAP deployment and the subnet lemon,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.575
It's optional, but it's good to have it when you have a multiple nodes.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:34.340
And the finally, we have a connection factory and the q.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.810
So these are the five important key factors for a James creation.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.105
So why do you need to have Jamie server,

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:44.105
j. M servers required to create a GMS modules.

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:45.230
And you might be asking,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.810
what is the js module that we'll talk about the next point.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.335
So the GMS or acts as a container like a Egypt container.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:54.020
So here it will handle it the resources.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.970
And what is a J must module.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.194
So James module, definition of J EMS and resources such as cues and topics.

00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:05.465
So those are the terminology is how we are posting a message.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:07.550
And another important thing there,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.920
the major reason why we need to have the AMS model,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.290
because if you have a GMS module,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.515
then only we should be able to create a queue.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:18.769
And next one, the SAP deployment.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.230
So some deployment, it's not required when you have only one node, R11 admin server.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.020
So think about this scenario in a production we might have

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.800
a multiple and nodes are multiple main and your servers, right?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.910
And those kind of scenarios,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.679
we're going to create a SAP deployment,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:38.600
which will grouping the categories are grouping some specific targets, servers.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.030
And the next thing, the connection factory,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.860
which is a J must connection factory.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.155
So what is the purpose of connection factor?

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:50.135
So the connection factor II is the one enables the resources.

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:51.980
What does, what it does.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.220
So it will enable the resources to handle the J must

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.580
clients to create the connection for a Destination.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.350
Destination means some one-to-one q.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.080
So connection factories, the one who's NA

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.160
establishing the connection between a Q and a message,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.690
right, so that's the next point.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.625
So j m is a queue because connection factor helpers to walks with the queue.

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:19.655
So now the last point is create a queue

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.690
because the Q is the point-to-point destination type.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.405
So that is where we'll post our messages.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:29.780
So once you post a message in your gym is skew and a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.085
restful taken care of and the connection factor because that'll establish a connection.

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:39.095
And SAP deployments so where the connection is available and the module.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:44.510
So which model contains the target servers and which server contented ASL.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.595
You can keep it in the reverse order as well.

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:49.625
And when it comes to create Jamie skew,

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:50.780
it's an easy process.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.650
But before we proceed into the coding,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.330
what we're gonna do is we're going to create a simple jm a server.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.670
And then we'll create a Q and a connection factory,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.550
and we'll talk about a simple example.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.090
Then we'll move on to the the entities,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.710
which means the persistence.
