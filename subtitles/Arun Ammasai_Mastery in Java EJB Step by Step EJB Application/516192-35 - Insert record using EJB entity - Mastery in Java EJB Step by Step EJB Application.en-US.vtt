00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.575
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:03.990
So the one thing we haven't done yet,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.910
It's insert into the database writer,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.060
so using our EGP query language.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.740
So let's try to enter some information into our office table.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.230
So, okay, so now what we can do,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.580
we have all of his course rates.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.770
So now let's go back to our bean.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.860
And then what we can do is let's try to add a matter here,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.250
like FAD office details.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.110
So here what I'm gonna do,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.435
I'm gonna simply pass the office detail here.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.500
I'm an obvious entity information,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.130
so which will be stored.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.740
So the moment I added a matter here obviously will get error message

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.650
in our implementation part variate mode management when.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.450
So what we need to do here, we need to offer

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.595
them and there are multiple ways you can do that.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:57.665
So I'm going to implement methods.

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:01.680
And the matter is I want to implement add details to screen, okay?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.935
So the amount of information available.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:09.060
Now what we need to do.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.520
So at simple like we already have data,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.840
what needs to be saved, right?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.170
So all we need to do is just go to Get transaction and begin.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.829
And then a m dot persist.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.350
If you're updating, we need to use the merge.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.970
And since we are doing a inset,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.340
I'm going to use the persist in the data.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.500
We are trying to persuade him that persist.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.025
Next thing, E m dot get entity or get transaction.

00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:46.114
And then when it with comment that data which is persisted.

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:49.115
Okay, so now we have the client that information ready.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:55.320
So now we need to go back to that test and we have to write a method to call this.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.225
So let's use the lookup

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:03.755
dot office details and we're going to pass off is implementing the array.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:06.050
So it's a, it's a kind of object.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.670
So I already copied the information here,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.840
so I just manipulated office information is here. Okay.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.490
So does Ln 1 r does lend to and said phone and 6, 7, 8 or 9 and 10.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.550
Once everything is done, all we need to do,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.020
just pass this information into your office.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.295
Details matter which will take the input and it will persist your data.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:34.440
And then we could apply the same logic.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.320
Here.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.570
New office has been inserted.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.040
So once it is done, we'll get D outcome.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.060
So I'll just save it.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.950
It'll deployed immediately.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.020
So deployment has been done.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.990
So let's right-click and run it one more time.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.060
I saw the obligation.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.570
It's more the console to see.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.050
At Giza, the new office YouTube has been inserted successfully, right?

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.425
So we tried insert,

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:20.099
we tried update, we tried select aswell.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.155
Currently in the select we tried multiple ways.

00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:26.665
Single query and join query and insert,

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:31.540
update using a query and update using Entity data CLI.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.450
So whatever the things which we tried here,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.460
we tried using the entity directly with us.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.470
We manipulated them entity here and we'll pass in

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.080
the integer to the method and then it will persist it.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.090
Or else what you can do use, again,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.835
you can use a query also insert into your entity

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:49.315
and the values like our normal SQL query.

00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:52.405
A similar way you can do EGP query as well.

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:55.300
Okay, So these are the important things which you need

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.240
to know when you're walking with age babies.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.290
The next video, I'm gonna give you some additional information about the HEP stuff.
