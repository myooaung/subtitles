00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.390
So we have the student entity which will communicate to the student table, right?

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.130
So let's go back to,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.390
so in my table,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.160
I have a few informations here,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.350
so let's try to run.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.065
And the student, Let's see how many cars are available.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.765
Okay, so I have just only one record here.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.475
Okay, So how I can print this information using your entity, right?

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.755
So let's go back to our ID.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.795
Okay, so here you might be seeing something called,

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.050
named Cody and it's student dot find all.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.235
So whenever you call this query,

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:45.230
automatically give you the information from the student.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.510
And this is not a SQL query,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.875
this is a JPA query,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:54.275
and I'll explain you what is a named query and how we can create a GP equity later.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:57.530
For now, I'm going to create a simple matter and I'll show you how we can

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.830
retrieve the information using this right there.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.980
So we don't want to use the beans which we already created.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.480
So we're going to create a new bin.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.575
So here, greatest musician beam,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:17.135
and I'm going to create a meaningful order management water management beam.

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:19.580
And let's have a remote session.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.500
I mean remote interface aswell,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.320
and click Next and the mapper names,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.080
so mean slash order management.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.060
Okay. And then we all know about the container, right?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.680
The transaction type we discussed,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.745
I would always container transaction type, transaction type, right?

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:43.895
And then click Finish.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:49.190
So now what I'm gonna do this is our new station bin, right?

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.880
So let's go to our interface method.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.170
And here That's right, I'm at that.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.850
So the matter we're going to write,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.650
we're gonna get a list of students, right?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:08.450
So I'm gonna write something like list of students end, get all Dorians.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.825
So this is the first model which we're going to use it.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.735
And let's go back to our main and here automatically

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:18.170
will get an error because we need to provide the implementation for the man thought.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.605
Okay, so first step is done.

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:24.170
So now let's go back to the person's not XML file.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.845
So this is the one which we Creator when you create the entities.

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:30.230
If you take a look at this here, u,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.230
v, The persist and unit here, right?

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.470
And also it has the order management in it.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.960
So this is a persistent unit and it has

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.340
a class called com dot Order Management dot Bean study into the semester.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.700
And because this is the only entity so for available

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.390
in my project because they cannot do only that particular table, right?

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.980
So let's try with that and then we'll move on to the next table sent out.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.810
Okay, so we need a,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.080
we have the person in and all we need to do is the next thing.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.720
We need to have the entity manager,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.680
because entity manager is the one who's going to create

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.599
the connection to pull from the database operations.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.590
So let's go back to our order management been EGN.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.030
What we're gonna do is we can simply use the annotation here.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.970
And persistent context.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.170
And here person contexts you need to provide void is the unique name.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.320
So you might be thinking why enter the program that unit m here?

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.660
Because if you take a look at the person and XML here,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.785
you have a person in it.

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:39.200
The similar way you might be having multiple persistent multiple processing unit.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.735
So unit it tells the beam which

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.995
unit exactly you're trying to create a new entity manager.

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:52.715
So here, entity manager,

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.310
I can call them as the entity manager am.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.110
Okay, so now what we can do,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.225
so using this EM,

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:03.965
we can simply call the V dot.

00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:09.094
And this is where we're going to use the named Cody because in my student,

00:04:09.094 --> 00:04:13.490
I have a named query because whenever you create an entity in

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.125
this final model will be always created by default.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.240
So for now let's use that.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.620
And so the one that you're going to use,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.215
we're going to instead create named according.

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:30.560
There are multiple different types of coding.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.600
We'll talk about that one by one later and then get the results set,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.200
which will give you the list of students.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.825
Okay, So now what else is missing?

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:47.885
So we have the entity manager and we have the matter which will invoke.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:49.310
So the next thing, what we need to do,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.050
we need to create a client, right?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.765
So we already have a client with the US,

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:59.750
which will help us to call the diploid EGB association being cleaned.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.640
So let's not use this.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.645
So I'm going to create a new class here in Tennessee.

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:11.660
It's great, dissimilar one controller and let's create a new balance.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:21.575
Auto management, water management, just and finish.

00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:28.205
And all we need to do to go back and copy the same things here.

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:31.520
We don't want to mess up the dow working so flights,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.875
so I'm just going to create it separately here.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.990
So let's move all of them.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.859
It is.

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:43.825
Okay, so what does the beam we are trying to put order management being read.

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:46.115
So Auto Management been doing.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:48.575
And then we'll go back here.

00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:52.265
I can Control V to V.

00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:57.140
So we need to find out what is the mapping name so we can find a mapping in.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.960
It will be available in D P name here.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.490
So copy that and provided here.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.650
Until we reach the end.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.770
Then we need to provide the qualifier name for our interface worthy interface,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.135
which we're using right now.

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:21.230
So we're all using our management remote, right?

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.750
So just to expand it and you can see

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.790
this right-click and copy qualified name here and then paste it here.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.860
So now we have everything.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.420
The next thing what we need to do,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.750
a lookup, dot, get all students.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.050
Okay, so not only that, what I'm gonna do,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.470
I'm gonna print all the stored information so system

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:56.060
dot out Dylan, save it.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.100
So why isn't here?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.350
Okay, so we need a jar, right,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.470
support, so I modified it to Java 8.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.835
Okay, so the next thing,

00:07:04.835 --> 00:07:07.910
we have a diploid and then we need to Randy a test.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.110
Let's do that in the next video.
