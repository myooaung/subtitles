00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.615
So we just created a new EGB and we created a simple test also.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:11.280
And we can look up forever a bean or management when.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.620
But do your editing and sent off.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.925
No, it's not exactly because we will end up with some SQL issue.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.135
The reason if you take a look at the postsynaptic cell and yes,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:22.845
I do have a persist and unit.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:24.390
I just added a few things here.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.525
I just added a transaction type as resource local.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.760
So the reason why I'm programming this is local.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.260
I am going to provide the,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.850
the properties. What are the properties?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.535
So you have to provide to the persistent unit,

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:40.040
this particular persist and in it just going to use

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.170
a specific database and the specific driver and the specific loading level.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.600
And so I just want to copy that.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.025
I'm going to paste it here.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:53.630
And you might be wondering why you're going to provide that, okay.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.085
Because we've already tried it.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.505
We already provided this information when you're creating the personal tech summit,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.140
that we created one level,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.439
creating an entities that will not save it into your project.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.630
Okay, So that isn't what you might be thinking.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.845
Why on the probability here,

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:09.020
because we, this order management,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.865
it is going to use these properties,

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.460
which means this particular databases.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.425
And these are the relevant at DTU was which means sorry, entities, right?

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:22.190
So save it. And that's the one thing that you need to change this,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.915
come back to the client now.

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.970
I mean our order management client.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.060
So the first thing which we need to do, Let's go back,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.890
Let's dip before deploying the coordinates,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.480
go back to the student once.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.610
So we are trying to print all the students, right?

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.650
And we don't have the toString method here.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.180
So whenever you're trying to print,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.860
it will print an object.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.690
So two hour that what we can do is we can simply provide degenerate toString matter,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.575
which will automatically cruelly override the toString matter.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:55.310
So whenever you print it will print this.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.840
Okay, so now let's deploy the code.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.660
Renounce over, choose your blood.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.920
And so here, I'm going to use next and finish.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.990
Let's go back to the server deployments.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.715
Okay, This is deployed.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:30.455
So now what allele on and do is we have claimed rate.

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:33.900
So let's run it and we'll see what's going to happen.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.170
General obligation.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.855
It might take a while because it has to go to the WebLogic,

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:52.500
takes it upon texture, and then look up the EGP and then it will call the method.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.420
Okay, see, I should open that logs here.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.545
Casey, student ID is equal to 1 and m is equal to a j.

00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:15.020
So now what we can do is let's go back to the database,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.610
will add few more information like add female, insert here.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.155
So what I'm gonna do is turn to Machu and I can Jane.

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.360
And I will provide some minor details,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.130
three inch and click Go.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.450
So two rows, him setter.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.390
Let's go back to the student.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.810
And then we'll see we have three students, right?

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.085
Let's go back to our code.

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:47.485
Let's rerun the code one more time.

00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:49.390
So what will happen for now?

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.605
We've got only one, right?

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.775
So when I run it now,

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:55.570
it has to bring the other two records also,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.840
which means three student information.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.440
See, they got all three steward informations here.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.665
Okay, so now we know how to make a comment,

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:23.035
communicate to the database and with the help of this persistent unit.

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:25.300
And the next thing which we entered Docker boat.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.925
So how it is walked actually,

00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:34.885
because I just simply call the good doll students method which is available in my entity,

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:36.115
which is an student.

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:37.990
This meant that so what is named Cody

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.210
and what are the different types of careers available?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.400
We'll talk about each and every one of them.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.750
But before that, what we're going to do,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.750
we just drew only one entity, right?

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.360
Let's create the other SASA.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.010
But if any of you are not going to use student anymore,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.830
it does just for showing you how it will work.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.085
So let's create all other entities as well.

00:04:55.085 --> 00:05:02.780
So let's select all of them and ignore the students and click Next.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.260
And it will show you that a mapping between the tables,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.900
customer to employee and the employee to employees and

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.570
employees to own fees or reveal all the one-to-one,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.240
one-to-many minute of an older map is sort of a label here.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.605
And click Next.

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:19.010
And key generated is going to be, we want,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.535
we can do is we can use auto-increment so it automatically create a key.

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:24.530
You don't have to prove any informations.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.110
And it's going to be under the same entity,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.670
Spanglish and click Next.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.955
And they certainly tables which is going to create is going to be credenza DTUs.

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:37.980
I mean, the entities finish.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.875
Okay, it is generating entity sounded end percentage.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:47.160
You should be able to see the percentage here.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.980
Okay, See now, then you should be able to see all the entities here,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.290
customer employee RVs and all of them.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.540
Okay. So now let's go back to the purse is from takes them and see what happened here.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.340
The moment I created an entity,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.210
it automatically added all the information in may persist and unit.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.495
So now we should be able to fetch all the information from

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:18.379
every different tables using entities,

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:23.105
because this student table is going to communicate to the student,

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:25.760
our Java object going to communicate to the student database,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.945
I mean student table,

00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:29.450
the similarly customer is going to discuss them.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.370
A Java object going to communicate to the customer database table.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.365
Similarly, everything will walk.

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:37.820
Okay, so in the next video,

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.200
what we're gonna do is let's talk about what are

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.910
the different types of courses available?
