00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.340
So we know about one simple table as a student

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.045
and we discussed how it is looks like in Java as well, right?

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:15.480
So now what we need to do is let's try to create a entity using a tables.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600
So the way how we can do that, it's pretty simple.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.620
You all you need to do,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:28.210
just go to your project and right-click and try to create search for entities.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.000
So here we have an option called GP into some table and click

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.115
and click next year and you won't be able to see anything here at all.

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:43.940
The problem is, this project is a Java project and it is supported EGP as well.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.100
So in my project it has only support for Java and EGP.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.240
So let's click Cancel.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.890
Now what we need to do a there,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.190
we're going to go back and modify your POM file to add a JV,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.210
a dependency or L.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.985
Simply write regular project and go to Properties and then choose a JPEG option here.

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:08.165
So whenever you choose RGB option here,

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.400
you need to configure something else,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.440
which means the further configuration and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.380
JP is the one is communicating to the data, which is right.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.835
So you have to provide the username and the password and the database informations.

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.980
So click for the configuration.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.435
You're not doing it here.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:24.890
You might be doing the next step,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.395
but for now, we can do it from here itself.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:32.210
So we're using generic two-by-two and I don't want to use any liability for now.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.285
So here And another thing,

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:36.440
we need to create a connection.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.610
So what do you mean the connection?

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.585
This is where we create establishing connection to the relational database.

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:45.290
So click Create Connection and we're going to use MySQL.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.625
Okay?

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:49.550
So normally what will happen, right?

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.565
So since I'm creating multiple times here,

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:54.065
because I haven't tried already,

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:56.345
because I have a lot of connections before.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:57.905
So when you're doing it the first time,

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:00.155
you face something like this.

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:04.235
So this is the first screen will pop up when you're doing it the first time.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:06.560
So here, whenever you choose any drivers here,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.200
you will get an error message here because it's unable to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.650
locate the char file for the MySQL JDBC driver.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.020
So to fix that issue,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.730
all you need to do go to the next step.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.875
And this is where we have the support of your MySQL Connector dot Java JAR file.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.160
For now, I have the MySQL current debt,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.660
which is located in my desktop.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.295
So whenever I'm going to do that,

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:34.250
I'll just simply map my MySQL JAR file here.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.140
So where does it go to desktop and another software,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.730
I have the MySQL current tile,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.815
so I'll just simply click and open.

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:46.640
It will map here. And then we can go from this location.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.460
Once it is done, you'll come back to here.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.680
And then we had to provide information about the database or the database name,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.025
shopping and database, right?

00:02:58.025 --> 00:02:59.554
And there is no password.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:03.110
So let's try Test Connection pinks or cylinder,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.245
which means we're successfully able to communicate to the database.

00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:07.685
Click Next.

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:11.135
In, just very federated one more time, everything looks good.

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:12.800
Let's modify the name New may as cry,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.090
don't want new MySQL, right?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.070
So let's try something else.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.925
So here, order management interface,

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:23.090
autumn, automotive open, That's fun.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.275
Order, underscore, management and disclosure,

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:35.310
database and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.185
disconnection on what I'm bringing.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:41.700
Sense it in next and finish.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.130
Okay, so now I have the dubious upward along with me, database connection ask,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.370
but the moment I click OK here,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.140
we have the GPS or whatever.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.690
I will, then click Apply and Close.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.020
So, so once you did that particular step,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.905
you'll have the purse is not XML under your metal ion or folder.

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:11.330
If you want, just open an XML file and you can see here that won't be anything

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.905
inside this particular persistent dot XML.

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:19.414
So the only thing that persists in unit will be available order management.

00:04:19.414 --> 00:04:22.400
So this is a person persistent units which we are

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.000
going to use for the entire next, this particular section.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.095
So instead this person unit will provide all the NTD information.

00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:31.070
As of now.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.830
We did not create any entity so far.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.660
Okay, so let's try with

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.360
one simple Example like we have a store in database ready to create a database,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.060
I mean entity for our student table.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.860
So it's simple, right leg,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.985
you are a project and go to Select JP and it is from table.

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:52.760
And here you can choose seen

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.910
the connection actor connections or an underscore management, and it's called database.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.100
And it here, it will list out all the available tables in my database.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.620
So maybe the first time if you're not able to see

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.220
this information to try to refresh the option once it'll come up.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.645
And then for now I'm going to use only store and we'll do the rest of the tables later.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:15.440
So whenever you click stood and make sure that this button is enabled.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.655
So what would happen right?

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:18.830
So whenever you create a new entity,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.070
it will be added into your purse is not XML automatically.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.955
So click Next, and that is no communication.

00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:27.530
There is no table relationship with

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.320
the other tables like foreign key constraints, nothing.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.095
So I'm going to click Next and key generator.

00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:35.975
So this is where you need to be very careful.

00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:38.285
So whenever you are using into deed,

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.205
must have a primary key.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.020
So if you have a primary key,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.075
how you're going to generate the key for it.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:47.300
So you can use any table or you can use any sequence,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.445
or you can use auto-increment or arctic innocent,

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:51.650
any identity for now I'm going to use none

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.710
because I'm going to pass some hard-coded information anyway.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.365
And you can keep the remaining asset is.

00:05:57.365 --> 00:06:06.950
And here what we can do is let's browse the package folder.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.300
Okay, so let's keep it in the order com.org or management of being struck DOD. Okay.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.110
So the management of package from DOT and

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.950
order management don't we haven't been trained.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.985
So I'm going to provide another folder called entities.

00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:33.629
And click Next and Finish.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.440
Okay, I did something wrong here.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.980
So there is a nice day rightly with the project.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.880
So it automatically crater D as the entity inside my resource folder.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.950
And I don't want it to be here,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.675
so I'm going to delete this one.

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.145
Let's try it one more time.

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:54.160
So let's delete the postsynaptic cell as well.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.225
Okay?

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:57.460
So now what I'm gonna do is just right-click it,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.150
does their package rates, right-click new JPA entity from here.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.800
And this will be faster now, so click Next.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.585
So I don't want to get into the bins.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:14.800
Maybe a 100 means I can create one more folder,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.910
entities and then click Next and Finish.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.065
So the moment it finished,

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:23.450
you should be able to see the entities folder here.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.635
Under the entity folders you have the storm now Java, at the same time.

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:31.130
It has all the information in a password.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.250
See here the ID.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:41.210
And then you might be thinking so while the name is provided here,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.560
this is my Java class name,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.970
how it knows that it is going to communicate to the student table.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.520
So since they're using Exhibit 3 when 0,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.190
you don't have to provide the main table him

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.860
specifically until unless there is no change.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.540
For example, our class name is student at the same demo table amounts also stored.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.855
And so you don't have to prove that in case if you have something different,

00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:04.250
maybe the table name is different.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.670
So what you can do use, you can use the annotation called table here,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.850
and you can provide the name.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.360
And you can provide the table name here.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.000
This, you can do it. So the similarly,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.935
not only for the table, even for a fields,

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:20.840
because in Java I have the name.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.660
It might be different in the database also,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.100
it might be firstName.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.630
So what do you can do is so ID indicates it's a primary key.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.390
So wherever you can see annotation ID,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.310
which means it's a primary key.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.360
And here I'm going to put another annotation column.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:46.650
So the column name is the name since I had the same here, I'm using that.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.690
So for example, in new table when we have something like first underscore name.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.870
So in those kind of scenarios you can prove or something like that

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.285
because my Java field name is name,

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:04.040
and this will be communicating to the MAC table ASA firstname. Okay, So you can prove it.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.155
But there is no change,

00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:09.080
a same in my Java object in my table as well.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.270
So I don't have to provide this information.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.855
Okay, so in the next,

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.360
in the next video, what we're gonna do is so we have the entity,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.710
so how we can fetch the information using these entities.
