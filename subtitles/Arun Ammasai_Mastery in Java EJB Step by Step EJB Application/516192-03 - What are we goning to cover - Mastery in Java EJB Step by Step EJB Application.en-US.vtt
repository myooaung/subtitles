00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.960
So as part of this course,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.805
what are we going to cover?

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.605
So that's important, right?

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.020
So we'll talk about what is

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.465
EGB and what is JPA and what is a database and why do we need them?

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.654
And what is dependency injection?

00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:20.955
And also we'll talk about the WebLogic server.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.290
So in the entire course,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.020
we're going to combine all of them together and we'll talk

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.770
about creating a simple applications.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.840
And we need to know one another.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.380
Think.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.070
So we should understand what are the different types of beans available

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090
in EGB right there at three major types.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.145
The first one is in session when and second one is entity been.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.495
And the third one,

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:46.490
message and true and been.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.460
Most probably we are not going to use the entity beam because it

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.330
is pretty much core concept in Egypt we do 0,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.260
but we're not going to use to bind 0 because we're going to use J1 through 0.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.360
So what are the purpose of the session?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.730
We're so in simple words,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.010
session beans contains the data for

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.320
a particular assertion because from

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.365
the name itself we're going to understand them beanies for a session.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:13.580
So it can be a stateful or it can be stateless aswell.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.530
And another important thing,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.575
the bean Sylvia get destroyed as soon as

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:22.985
this session ended or as soon as decision a terminator.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:26.510
We'll talk about what is a stateless and stateful later

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.475
and before we move on to the next one which is a entity when so,

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:32.900
what is the entity been?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.265
So entity been basically represents the persistence data storage,

00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.440
which means how we can communicate to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.770
the database and how the entities is going to help us to achieve

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.460
the database activity via the entity

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.410
mean and artillery that we can use

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.080
the entity being to retrieve the data from the databases,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.535
which means that good operation,

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:55.760
or you can call them as a finishing operation.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.000
And the next important thing, so message it drew and beans does

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.080
the most advanced concept and most important as bowed,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.880
some message driven beans basically used for a GMS gone past.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.895
So as someone posting some messages.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:13.715
So who is going to consume the message?

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.625
So consuming and broadcasting.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.850
So that'll be a place in the slower wire.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.065
We can't forget a GMS context or that it will be q,

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:26.015
which is configuring the GMS.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:29.300
So the queue will keep on listening to a particular port.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.310
So whenever there is a message posted,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.045
it consumes a message and it broadcast some functionality.

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:37.505
So that is a major purpose of the message.

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:39.600
Drew and bean.
