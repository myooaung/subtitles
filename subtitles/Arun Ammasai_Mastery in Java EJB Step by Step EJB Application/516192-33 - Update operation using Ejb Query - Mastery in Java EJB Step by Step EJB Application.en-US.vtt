00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.835
So we tried a lot of fetch operation or you can say select operations.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:11.850
So let's try some update as well using EGP query language.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.940
For now what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna just simply run the employees.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.295
And let's see what are the other cells here.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.985
So let's try to write a matter to update the FirstName,

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:24.450
LastName for an employee, right?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.595
So for example, we'll try with 1702.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.810
So far one zone 0,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.585
I want to update first name and last name, mesophyll Carlson.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:34.155
Okay.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.360
First of all, we're gonna do is let's try with a normal update.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.950
So update employees set and the fetal limb.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:51.215
What we're gonna do last name is equal to comma

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.990
and firstName

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:02.490
equals, sorry, fellow.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.220
Employee number is equalled 1.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.220
Okay, so let's run this query.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.095
So one rule of factoring.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.060
So what I'm gonna do, let's try to search

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:32.750
the same employee will see l k. So if you take a look at it,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.230
170 now becomes the Phil Mickelson, right?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.410
So how we can do the same thing in Egypt Query Language,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.180
it's pretty simple, okay?

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.370
So we can do directly here.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.290
We don't know how to do try and directly here you can go

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.665
to our EGB and create a method straightaway.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:53.285
So here what we're gonna do first thing we'll go to the remote so we can create a method.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:02:01.880
So point and I'm going to point what we can do, update employee details,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.320
employee details, and then I'm going to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.660
pass end employee number normally will pass names.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.730
But anyways, it's just a simple example in a basking

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.460
the employee number here and controls it.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.840
No, not employee number,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.060
not only employee number when a diploid,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.110
What is the first name,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.880
last name, whichever client to update.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.010
So String first name, last name.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.080
So basically what's going to happen?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.800
So whenever I try to update employee details,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.060
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to provide the employee number for this employee number,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.430
I'm going to update this first name and last name.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.090
Okay.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.880
So let's go back to the management been obviously we know that it is going

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.525
to read an error message because we want to implement,

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:59.675
once again Control S. And let's implement that.

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:01.670
Okay, let's go down here.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.865
So this is where we're going to write our entity query manager here.

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:10.140
So basically firstly, let's write a query and then we'll pass it a string.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.230
So what we're going to pass,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.825
we want to create the bit rate.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.325
So update and what is the table limits employed they will rate.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:24.770
But here we're going to use the employee object.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.945
So employee. And let's go back to order management here.

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:35.779
Let's save it. And go back to our management here and update.

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.175
And the object name EMP spade is a reference name.

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:44.360
And we're going to use set EMP dot.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.490
And what is the FirstName field here.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.675
And go down. So here is a first-name,

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:59.075
firstname Control C. And go back to order management being here.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:05.120
Control, all WE is the quilt and we need to pass some parameter here.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
So I'm going to pass F name.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.250
So come on and the last name to E and P dot

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.885
last name is a name.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.900
And so what is the condition?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.425
Okay, not to enter the viral condition where

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:35.795
AMP dot employee number is equal.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:39.620
We interpret the parameter also, so AMP.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.355
So let me put it in a separate line so we can see it in a precise manner.

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.250
Okay, So now we have update employee a set,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.385
firstName and lastName be how three different parameters here.

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:52.925
So now the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to create a query,

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.500
I mean the EGP query.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.359
So m dot create

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.585
a T38 query.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:09.814
And here we need to provide the query what we're created.

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:13.115
And then it's not done yet.

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:16.175
We need to provide this set parameter.

00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:18.320
And we need to provide the data.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.030
And the employee number as well. Okay.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.770
The first one is employee number,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.060
so this is the employee number h.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.035
So copy and paste it here.

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:35.240
And then the second set parameter,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.925
Let's copy that control C. Or maybe what we can do is let's do this control X.

00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:46.760
Let's, I want to do it in a clear and precise manner.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.050
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a variable and then we'll do that

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:59.690
QR Y into V

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.360
set parameter like Q or y set parameter.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.630
And we'll do the same for the other two as well,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.060
Control-C until they can truly.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.220
The first one is for F10,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.740
which is the firstname, Control C, Control V,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:25.260
and this is the element, firstName and lastName.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.460
Ok, So finally what we're gonna do, any idea?

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.075
You might be thinking why I'm doing something like that.

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:42.005
Because we are doing update and what do we associate here?

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:43.670
Now, I'm going to hold it for a second.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.505
You think of what the end just realize,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.185
do, are we doing it correctly here?

00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:49.640
Any idea?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.040
So far we're doing good.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.555
But you might be thinking,

00:06:53.555 --> 00:06:57.740
we're not looking for any result from the correlate.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.040
So Q or y dot get a sense that this is what,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.440
this is what we normally does.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.810
But here in the corner which I'm using,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.750
it's gonna do some data modification,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.550
some DMR process, right?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.955
So in those kind of scenarios, intranet using getters,

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:20.480
You are not supposed to get rid of that because you're trying to update that at an audit,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.310
select the data, getting the results.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.295
That is for only for select operation we are trying to update.

00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:27.065
So which means what we're gonna do,

00:07:27.065 --> 00:07:31.310
we need the execute update my data.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.325
So which will automatically finish updating.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.920
Okay, so now what we're gonna do,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.440
We made a change and we saved it,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.545
it automatically get deployed in our WebLogic server.

00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:47.660
So meanwhile, what we're going to do,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.915
Let's go to the unemployment is picked already.

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.565
Okay, let's go to the test.

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:58.055
And here what we're gonna do is let's just comment out the previous implementations.

00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:04.670
So here we're going to call the lookup dot update employee details.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.400
Here we need to provide three information, correct?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.095
First one is the employee number.

00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:12.170
So let's go to the SQL result here.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.860
And let me run a select all from employees.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.130
Okay, So which imply we can update it now.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:30.710
So 11 43, Let's try to update the 11 43 as John Matthew. 11 43.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.335
So let's go back to the test.

00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:36.185
So though employee number 11, 43,

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:39.890
the firstName or John,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.810
and they can provide john Dennis,

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.095
my friend name, Sean Dennis.

00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:48.950
Okay. The moment I run this code, you know what'll happen?

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.860
The data needs to be updated properly, right?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.575
So before that it is 1143, right.

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:58.745
So let's go back and 11, 43.

00:08:58.745 --> 00:09:02.225
Let's run piece of discovery and we'll see what the outcome,

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:03.995
okay, so this is the outcome.

00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:06.185
So bow I engineer or antennae bow.

00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:07.820
So now what we're going to do,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:14.450
let's save it and let's run it as a Java application.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.370
But before that what I'm going to run whatever vertices.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:25.040
So here, employee, I gotta put it in the material still.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.675
But anyway, given here,

00:09:26.675 --> 00:09:31.100
just right-click and run as Java application.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.225
Okay? So just wait for a few seconds.

00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:38.540
It will get, um, later.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.790
Okay, So there are some issues.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:46.175
So let's maximize the console and see what is the issue here.

00:09:46.175 --> 00:09:49.445
So the no transaction is currently active.

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:52.940
Okay. So now we've got something because do you guys remember we

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.820
tried we talked about the container transaction and being transaction.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.065
So here it says then there is no transactions available so far.

00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:04.820
So how are we going to fix it?

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.830
So that's what we're going to talk about in the next video.
