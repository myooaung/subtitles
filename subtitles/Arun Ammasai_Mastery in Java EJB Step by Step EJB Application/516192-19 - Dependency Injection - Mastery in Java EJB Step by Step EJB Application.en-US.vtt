00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.025
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.550
So we discussed about how to use a time and salaries.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.370
And now the next thing that you're going to talk about is dividends, the injection.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.690
So we all know,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.490
but what is that dependency injection?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.315
So injecting some dependency dynamically.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:22.065
So that is where dependency injection comes into the picture.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.870
Okay, so it can be applied in a multiple ways.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.230
It can be applied to a field or any

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.145
saturated or even it can be applied for the methods as well.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:34.290
And how it can be identified.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.265
So the Egypt, the container is taken care of everything because the EEG

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.580
become container holds the J and a registry,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.045
which means address of all the local located dependency.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.570
So our container, it has a JND for each and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.815
every dependency and whenever it's required to be provided to the GPS.

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:55.400
And there are different types of annotations available.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.530
So first one is at EGP.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.819
So this will help us to injecting another ADP as a reference to our business logic.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.305
And we can use the resources asked were used to inject a data source,

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:11.585
a session, and time, as you guys might

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.750
remember in the previous example we used at resource.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.584
Then we are trying to inject the session context.

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:22.054
And the last point is applied to a field or a method.

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:24.560
Okay, so as I, as I always mentioned,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.510
just talking about what it is not going to be enough.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.195
Let's see NS simple example.

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:33.815
So we're back to our GPS here, I mean our project.

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:35.150
So first thing what we're gonna do,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.405
I'm gonna create a new session mean.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:41.615
So rightly your package and create a session bean.

00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:43.670
And this is just for testing, but put stripes,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.625
I'm going to create a secondary session mean secondary eNB,

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:54.410
and lets him port remote and click Next.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.070
In container, everything remains the same and click Finish.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.505
So I'm not going to have any big implementations here.

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.775
So all we need we are trying to do is we are trying to call

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:08.885
this particular EGP using my previous EGP.

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:12.530
So you might be thinking about the EGF is available in the same project.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.980
You can simply create an object for this class and you can call the methods,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.465
yes, that is still possible.

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:21.410
But think about the scenario in the same WebLogic server you have multiple Egypt is.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.275
So to call one AGB from another EGB,

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:26.030
it might be a separate deployment as well.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.755
And those kind of scenarios,

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:33.970
these annotations will help us for now we're going to use in the same project.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.790
So there's our interest rate.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.575
So let me create a simple matter here like saying like wide secondary interface,

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:47.360
I mean secondary metabolite, secondary session.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:56.800
So let's go back to our session bin and let's implement the methods.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.065
So what I'm gonna do,

00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:02.980
just simply providing us this four here that is fine and good.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.030
I'm going to say Welcome to a secondary session being.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.195
So how are we going to call this mean?

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:17.840
We are not going to use the initial context and using any mean internally,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.400
I'm going to use any business name here,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.660
since there's a save, Let's name.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.695
What I'm gonna do is they can provide some mapping and right,

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:26.870
so mapping and m is equal to.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.600
So bin slash secondary been anywhere I'm going to use it.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.280
I'll tell you the reason why.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.725
Because we are directly using annotations EGP,

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.065
which will return to the interface here.

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:42.110
Okay, so now we have the AGB session minutes ready.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.060
So now let's go back to her old,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.070
I mean, our first bin which we created,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.880
which is a test session with and here what I'm trying to do is I'm trying

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.105
to call our secondary been from our decision-making.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:59.270
So what I'm trying to do, Let's create a separate matter here.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.105
So what I'm gonna do inside of this session window mode,

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:05.180
and I'm going to call another credit method,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.530
call an EGP ADB reference.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.770
Okay, so let's come back to decision mean and implement the method at k.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.725
So here we have the empty implementation,

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.645
but this is the important part.

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:27.320
So how are we going to inject our EGI bit of friends?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.550
So using the annotation EJ, Java and not x.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.370
So what is the bean interface?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.350
Say again, secondary session being rate,

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.650
we having remote, remoter interface, right?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.630
So I'm going to use secondary session being remote.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.180
And it's going to invoke the easy reference.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.660
Okay, so now we have the Egypt reference.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.000
All we can do is using this represents we can

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
call whatever the method is available in the secondary beam.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.280
As of now we have only one method.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:11.870
So let me put some assets for here so we can see the outcome and secondary EGB.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.995
And then using the EGB reference

00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:20.720
to a matter of juvenile hall is a second decision, Matata. Okay.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.180
So now we have our two AGVs to session injuries from the first session EGB,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.560
I'm going to call the second system ADP.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.180
It's not directly amusing.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.475
So my caution is,

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:34.190
you might be thinking this is the hourglass or I can simply do

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.690
this here session when

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:46.085
OBJ vijay.

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:49.055
And then you can simply use OBJ dot.

00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:51.080
This will also possible,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.220
but here what is happening?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.020
We are creating a new object here.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.550
And it is also in the same project.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.770
Think about in the same way, blood, etc.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.840
You'll have a multiple EEGs and age and every EGP part of separate projects.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.210
But all we would deploy it in the same way,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.470
blogging, Sarah and those kind of scenarios.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.330
You don't need to create these kind of objects or not.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.110
You can simply use the EGP annotation and you can call them.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.500
So now we have the age of reference here and we're calling the method.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.770
So let's deploy the changes first, okay,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.600
to run on server and deploy interval local host server here.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.915
Next and Finish.

00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:33.685
Okay, So deploy application instructor grading for proctors.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:36.715
Okay, So deployment, publishing finished.

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:39.100
So now all we need to just go back to our client

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.830
where we are having the test matters. This is the one right?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.990
So we have lookup existing already.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.180
So now all we need to do just using the same little corp dot one and whatever you wanna

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.320
call will call another Egypt a reference because

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.700
the dividend from a tree internally calls the another session being.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.510
So now all we need to just right-click and run as a Java application.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.770
Okay, So diamond creator,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.785
that is for this particular.com,

00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:18.265
It might take few more seconds because we have the timer off ten seconds.

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:20.095
So after 10 seconds it will be called.

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:23.575
And then we've got our Welcome to

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:28.405
a secondary session when and this is a invoke secondary EGP,

00:07:28.405 --> 00:07:31.480
which is printed from our first session bean,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.945
and this is coming from our second session beam.

00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:37.855
So this is how you need to make use of

00:07:37.855 --> 00:07:42.400
the annotations to injector that resource or an EGP.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.270
And here what we tried is we just used as a field.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.700
And the same thing you can do as a method as well.
