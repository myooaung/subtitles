00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.830
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.590
In this lecture, we're going to continue from where we start.

4
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.510
Now, over here, we're going to have a test widgets, which is going to say ship free.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.390
And over here we are going to have the the correct icon.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.520
That is the minus icon.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
And over here, we are going to have the quantity of the product that is in the products we have.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.780
And over here, we are going to have the increment icon that is the plus icon.

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.170
Okay.

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.070
Now to do this, we're going to need to go back to our V code.

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.460
Okay.

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
Now after the row, they're going to need to add a true comma and as well are going to be using a drill

13
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.110
since we want all our widgets to be displayed horizontally.

14
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.630
And as you know, it has these children.

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.350
Okay.

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.960
Now we can use control and that's the save.

17
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.190
Okay.

18
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.990
Now, the first child is going to be a test widget and is going to say ship.

19
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.840
Three.

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.090
Okay.

21
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, we can't give this on story.

22
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.930
It's going to it says STI.

23
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.360
Okay.

24
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.240
We can then say font size of 16 and as well fonts.

25
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.750
Font.

26
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.170
Sweet.

27
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.910
It's going to be fun, sweets.

28
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.550
That w 500.

29
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.040
Okay.

30
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.800
Now how do you truecommerce role and use control and this to save and go check what you just did.

31
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.380
Okay.

32
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.320
You can see there's no more space.

33
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.690
So now what we can then do is.

34
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.240
Okay.

35
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.930
I'm going to give a size sized bucks.

36
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.660
I can't give you the space vertically.

37
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.980
That is from top to bottom.

38
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.440
So this is going to be height, height of five.

39
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.120
I think ten is way too much.

40
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.870
Okay.

41
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.660
He's controlling this.

42
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.080
Is he?

43
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.620
Okay, great.

44
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.050
Now we're going to have the documents icon.

45
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.470
That is the minus icon.

46
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.850
Okay.

47
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.030
Not to do this after the tests we get, but we just have to do so as a trail cover and as we are going

48
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.630
to make the.

49
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.700
My nose wasn't clickable.

50
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.000
Right.

51
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.090
So you can just use the icon button.

52
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.610
Okay as well.

53
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.070
It's going to take the press.

54
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.140
So you can't leave the function empty for now.

55
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.430
Okay.

56
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.180
For the.

57
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.610
I can't.

58
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.360
It's going to be called widgets and it's going to be icons, dots minus.

59
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.660
Okay.

60
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.630
Okay.

61
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.990
I don't really think we have any high com.

62
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.460
Like minus a layer.

63
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.630
So what we can do?

64
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.640
We can check if we have got a nickel vaccino vaccine or.

65
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.470
Icons.

66
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.780
Okay.

67
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.570
You can't say dots minus.

68
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.520
Okay.

69
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.200
Okay.

70
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.900
Now, what we can do is we can increase the heights of the overall container.

71
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.190
Okay.

72
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.520
So over here, we can't just change it to 160.

73
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.010
So we have some additional space vertically.

74
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.350
Okay.

75
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.950
Great.

76
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.960
Now you can see the miners icon over here.

77
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.500
Okay.

78
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.470
Or we can check if we have all of that type of Midas icon.

79
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.500
Okay.

80
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.590
I can get rid of this.

81
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.380
Considered minus say.

82
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.390
The catching.

83
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.250
We are just minus sickle cell or let's check for this.

84
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.300
Okay.

85
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.940
Let's check for.

86
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.930
Dirt minus.

87
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.010
Okay.

88
00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.770
Circle.

89
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.830
Okay.

90
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.060
I think I prefer this.

91
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.360
Okay.

92
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.520
No, he's going to go with the other.

93
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.880
Okay.

94
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.980
You can go to any of your choice.

95
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.310
Okay.

96
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.860
Katrine is now over here.

97
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.190
We're going to have the quantity of the products.

98
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.610
Right.

99
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.850
Okay.

100
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.780
So what you can do?

101
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.670
Well, yeah, I'll try Tacoma.

102
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.710
We can then have a card.

103
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.080
The reason for this card is so we have access to the elevation property.

104
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.690
Okay, so you can see elevation of maybe 13.

105
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.910
Okay, now we can arbitrate.

106
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.290
The charge is going to be a container.

107
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.590
Okay.

108
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.660
Okay.

109
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.500
Now the reason for this container is.

110
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.480
So we have access to basically the.

111
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.200
Okay.

112
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.910
So we can give you tweets of maybe 100 and C first.

113
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.270
Okay.

114
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.650
Then you can.

115
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.840
Have the declaration box declaration.

116
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.500
And we can see color is going to be colors pink.

117
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.750
Okay.

118
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.970
And it's indicative that we can then have a child test for the.

119
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.610
Now, we can't just say we have one here.

120
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.270
That's okay.

121
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.500
Nice punch.

122
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.850
Safe and good check.

123
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.500
Okay.

124
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.050
I think this is way too much.

125
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.360
Let's try 50 and see.

126
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.150
Okay.

127
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:44.130
So I think the television you can see it has a little shadow play by a try, which we should try five

128
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.640
and see.

129
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.770
Okay.

130
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.560
Now we can take this to the middle.

131
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.360
This one.

132
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.720
Okay.

133
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.970
Let's wrap it with the center.

134
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.660
Okay.

135
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.030
Wrap with Center.

136
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.770
And see.

137
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.040
Okay.

138
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.930
Great.

139
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.680
Okay.

140
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.260
What about increasing the heights?

141
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.730
Okay.

142
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.940
50 and see.

143
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.280
Okay.

144
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.230
Way too much.

145
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.860
Okay.

146
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.910
Let's try 20.

147
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.050
Okay.

148
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.500
I think this is okay.

149
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.100
I can't now.

150
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.440
We can't have the ink rights icon.

151
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.990
So what we can do now is how to drink cola and icon can.

152
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.900
I can.

153
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.560
But in case of press.

154
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.590
Okay.

155
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.270
I can we get.

156
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.240
Okay.

157
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.780
It's going to be.

158
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.810
Let's check if I can start.

159
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.100
Hopefully we do.

160
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.850
Okay.

161
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.140
Other of the way.

162
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.600
Okay.

163
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.150
Great.

164
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.590
Just check if we have something better for the Cupertino and Cupertino.

165
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.290
That's in.

166
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.570
But see no icons.

167
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.460
That's odd.

168
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.590
Okay.

169
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.020
Okay.

170
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.140
I think the only difference is this is very weak.

171
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.520
Okay.

172
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.110
Great.

173
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.000
You can see.

174
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:46.870
Okay.

175
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.920
Now what you can do is you can change the color so you can see his thigh.

176
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.840
This can be just-I.

177
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.340
And you can see color what the colors will be white.

178
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.790
Okay.

179
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.730
And this country and this.

180
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.660
Okay.

181
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.390
Grace.

182
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.880
Okay.

183
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.460
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
