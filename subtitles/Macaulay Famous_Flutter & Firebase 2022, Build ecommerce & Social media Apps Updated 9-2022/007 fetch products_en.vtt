00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.450
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.210
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.010
In this lecture, you go there.

4
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.360
No, lots of fish products.

5
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.800
Okay, now to do this, going to need to go back to obviously good.

6
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.870
And then the provider dietary and then the products.

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.410
Okay.

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.740
And now we can then use control and be know that's a big this way.

9
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.130
Okay.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.010
Now to do this, we are going to need to get rid of all this data we have.

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.600
Okay.

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.900
Tense here.

13
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.320
Right.

14
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.990
So we can just use contra and C to copy and then backspace to delete it.

15
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.800
Okay.

16
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.280
And not just going to from others.

17
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.640
Okay.

18
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.690
Okay.

19
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.930
Not to fetch this product over here.

20
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.450
You're going to need to create a function.

21
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.880
Okay.

22
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.430
This is gonna take some time, so it's going to be a future.

23
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.990
And we can see Floyd and we can call this function fetch.

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.090
Her Murdoch's.

25
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.110
Her.

26
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.170
Okay.

27
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.610
Okay.

28
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.820
It's going to take a year since it's going to take some time.

29
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.770
Okay.

30
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.350
Now we can then see our weights.

31
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:22.630
And the first step is to go into this product for the right liberties for that that has access to overhaul

32
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.830
our documents been stored or we have all our products are being stored.

33
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.410
What awaits Firebase ready out of it in the calls fi firebase tour guides collection.

34
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.470
There's going to be.

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.960
Products.

36
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.290
Right.

37
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.620
Okay.

38
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.440
Now, all you have to say is Dot's gets there is going to be saying dot duck rides because we are not

39
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.010
fetching just a single document, but we want to have access to all the documents.

40
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.340
So I just wanna say, get Dan Dodds Dan.

41
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.860
Okay.

42
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.540
Now, you can just use this to break this down and had a semicolon over there.

43
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.470
Okay.

44
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.040
Now what is value we're going to pass in a rebel known us so we not really know that you can call this

45
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.580
anything.

46
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.910
I call my products snap shots and it is a type of query snapshots.

47
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.910
You're about to do something about document snapshots.

48
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.330
When you went fetch in just a detail or just a document is going to be known as document snapshot.

49
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.310
But when fetching more than one document or more than one detail.

50
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.890
It is known as query snapshots.

51
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.720
Okay.

52
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.110
Great.

53
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.340
Now the next step is to look over.

54
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.960
Each document we have.

55
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.450
Okay.

56
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.500
So we'll just have to do is to call that verbal.

57
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.170
You can't first of all, you can see this variable has a container that has access to all our documents.

58
00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.850
Right.

59
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.220
Okay.

60
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.070
So it has access to all those two products.

61
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.050
So what we can then say is we can look over each item.

62
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.800
And for now, we just have two documents or two item or two products.

63
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.950
Okay.

64
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.320
So we can say products.

65
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.260
Snapshots dart docs dots for each.

66
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.770
For each element that is for each her dots.

67
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.800
Then we can just break this down.

68
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.450
They're able to say We're going to call this empty products.

69
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.700
For now.

70
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.530
It is empty, right.

71
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.570
We're going to have to do this list.

72
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.510
So if call it per dots.

73
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.670
Then Dodds in SAS.

74
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.000
Okay.

75
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.620
Once we start to that's.

76
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.610
This is what is zero.

77
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.540
And what is that?

78
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.070
The production model writes a production model.

79
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.380
You can see the hazardous fields.

80
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.840
I think we're going to need to have silica along.

81
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.860
And.

82
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.780
Okay.

83
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.010
Okay.

84
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.470
Okay.

85
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.070
Now for the ID, I think you've seen this before.

86
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.160
There's going to be element, this element whereby we are looping element dots gets like the field is

87
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.149
you can just copy it and make sure you don't make any mistake as well.

88
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.380
There's going to be an element.

89
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.960
The.

90
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.010
That gets.

91
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.590
It is going to be tighter.

92
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.170
You can just copy to make sure you don't make any mistake.

93
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.950
Okay.

94
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.770
Can just copy.

95
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.760
It's going to be elements.

96
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.990
That gets okay.

97
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.120
As well for the price is going to be element.

98
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.820
That gets the kid sinking in the knee so you can see what is trying to say is undefined.

99
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.440
Then this is not going to work because because it is a double.

100
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.000
So what we can do is we are going to need to say double.

101
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.920
Dance class.

102
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.350
And.

103
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.230
Yeah, you pronounce it.

104
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.120
And cries.

105
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.750
And as well, there's going to be double doors.

106
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.180
Sorry.

107
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.440
It's going to be elements.

108
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.990
To get an image email and copy this.

109
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.410
Elements.

110
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.870
It gets okay and based.

111
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.370
Okay.

112
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.940
For now, we can just see quantities to begin to sort it out later.

113
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.870
Okay.

114
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.460
Now you understand what we're basically doing, right?

115
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.520
If you do understand, you can let me know what you are simply doing.

116
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.900
As we first of all have access to we all of that product has tried.

117
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.130
That is the products and there are similar ones against it.

118
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.540
And then why we are sent or then want to look over each.

119
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:12.150
Documents on Huawei's products rights and then where sibling sibling had any to this empty list we have.

120
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.940
Okay.

121
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.650
This is basically how the first product from your database.

122
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.510
Now you've learned how to fetch a single document and now you're learning how to fetch multiple documents.

123
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.390
It is basically it.

124
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.840
Okay.

125
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.940
So in gymnastics, here you go, a little nuts.

126
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.740
We are going to call this functional goldfish for dogs.

127
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.090
Okay.

128
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.830
Okay, guys, see you in investiture.
