00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.040
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.500
Now, what I'm going to do in this lecture is if we don't have any item in our cards, then we're going

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.380
to need to display the cards into screen else.

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.149
If we do have item in our cards, then we're just going to display the item just like this.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.560
Okay.

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.840
They know that to do this, they're going to need to go back to Our Vinci Code and then the cards screen.

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.280
Okay.

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.770
And now we can then use control and be in order to make this white.

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.120
Okay.

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.410
Not to do this.

12
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.750
We're going to just go to the scaffold.

13
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.330
Okay.

14
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.220
Scattered.

15
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.130
Okay.

16
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.810
Now, rather than do some check everything on the scorecards provider.

17
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.460
That's.

18
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.230
Gets carts, I-10 that is not empty.

19
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.710
That is, if we do have an item in our cards, then they are going to return this.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.480
That is displaying the cuts item products.

21
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.840
Okay.

22
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.290
Now, house revenue go down to this covered.

23
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.700
How's it going to happen at this Catholic?

24
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.740
Right.

25
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.240
As we want to say body then.

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.460
Cards, empty screen that says we do not have any item in our carts.

27
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.060
Okay.

28
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.410
Now read is going to need two hearts.

29
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.580
We start this.

30
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.910
Hard to start this.

31
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.550
Okay.

32
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.870
Now go check it out.

33
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.220
You can see it is going to take some time to refresh the app.

34
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.550
Okay.

35
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.630
Now go check it out.

36
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.390
You can see currently we don't have any cards item.

37
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.720
Right.

38
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.020
Okay, now let's go and had one.

39
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.880
Okay.

40
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.110
We condense.

41
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.190
Okay.

42
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.070
Now go back.

43
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.690
Okay.

44
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.330
Now you can see we do not have.

45
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.259
It cuts, I think, as all of our year.

46
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.900
You can have a scarf as you can have an arbor if you want.

47
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.030
As you can see, a bar.

48
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.440
A bar.

49
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.940
And the safe harbor for this hot item if you want, a chemist would get rid of this.

50
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.530
Okay.

51
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.610
This country, this.

52
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.370
Remember this item?

53
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.930
We already created the design for it.

54
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.140
So we are just simply calling it that most of the time you to need to go over the lectures 2 to 5 times

55
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.740
and that's on my site and understand how everything works.

56
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.190
Okay.

57
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.470
You can see where they have the design over here, right?

58
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.800
This is an image you're seeing and your cards, it's empty and the font size is $30.

59
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.200
Y is very big and that is all the fonts with this board.

60
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.220
Okay.

61
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.330
You can see the shop now, but in as well, I think you saw it.

62
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.660
Okay.

63
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.430
So we can just get rid of this.

64
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.860
Okay.

65
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.230
You can see it now, right?

66
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.890
Okay.

67
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.490
I think this should be hard for the cards screen.

68
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.940
Okay.

69
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.740
Okay, guys, see in the next picture.
