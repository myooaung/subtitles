00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.939
In this lecture, we are going to make our codes more readable.

4
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.450
Okay, now, over here we have a variable called subcategory value, and we set is equal to a test which

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.850
is going to say sheds.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.540
And definitely since it's a test, it is a data type of string.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.090
Okay, now what we can do is instead of having this test which is shared, we can have a test which

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.460
is going to say sub category.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.080
And of course, you know, this must be this must be within the sub category list, right?

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.060
So what we can do is we have to copy this, okay?

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.460
Copy this and head to our subcategories list.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.860
We have that within the utilities and yeah, okay, we have this women men category men subcategory.

13
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.320
Sorry, we have to pay that over there.

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.990
So.

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.050
And we need a comma buyer.

16
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.000
Okay, I'm just going to copy this.

17
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.970
Copy this paste for the women.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.370
And pays for the phones and pays for the shoes.

19
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.050
I'm just going to have my trainer come over here and you can just have for the rest.

20
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.880
Candy is going to do this one more time.

21
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
You can cut for the rest or probably this as well.

22
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.240
Okay.

23
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.020
Now you can hide for the rest.

24
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.930
Okay.

25
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.790
And.

26
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.530
Over here in the middle category, we can have another value which is going to say select.

27
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.420
Select.

28
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.150
Main category.

29
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.210
Okay.

30
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.220
This country needs to save now and back to the flawed products.

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.300
He says of this man, we can then say select.

32
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.660
Main category.

33
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.210
Okay.

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.310
And now what we have to do is you can see over here.

35
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.310
You can still buy a.

36
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.040
We are basically using the SAT state to update the subcategory value to the shared.

37
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:29.460
That is, if the user chooses the main subcategory and if the user chooses the women category, then

38
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.100
we want to update the subcategory value to say dress right.

39
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.040
But you can see currently we have it says we say subcategory over here.

40
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.740
And you can see why we have a test with this subcategory.

41
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.450
And we also do have a test which is subcategory, right?

42
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.730
So what we can just do is we can get rid of that straightaway, get rid of the set state.

43
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.460
And the reason for this is because we want each subcategory to have that subcategory as is first test.

44
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.930
We can get rid of this.

45
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.980
And get rid of this.

46
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.880
Okay.

47
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.330
I think this is more easier to read now.

48
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.860
So what we are basically saying is if the value is equal to demand, that is, if the user chooses the

49
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.680
men subcategory, then.

50
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.890
So if the user chooses the main, main category, then we want to display the main subcategory.

51
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.620
Right.

52
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.810
Okay.

53
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.020
You can see over here we created a list called subcategory list and we are basically updating that to

54
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.030
whatsoever category.

55
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.270
The user chooses the same thing via.

56
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.810
And after this we then have to set stage set state to change the main category value.

57
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.910
To whatsoever value the user chooses.

58
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.030
Remember, you need a logical buyer and also we have to change the sub category value to a default value,

59
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.970
which is just going to say a subcategory.

60
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.450
And of course, this is not changeable.

61
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.610
Right.

62
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.700
This is going to be the default value or to start this now and check it out.

63
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.190
I know this would be very, very confusing at the moment, but most of the time you just have to go

64
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.020
back to it again and try to understand why, know this would be very confusing at this point.

65
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.180
Okay.

66
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.820
And now we have to try.

67
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.030
Okay.

68
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:56.030
And you can see saying select men category and now we can pick men and default it sets to what subcategory

69
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.540
that is the first item and we'll click on it and you can see we have just the men's subcategory over

70
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.080
there.

71
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:13.400
And women, you can see a sense of category and you can see we have just women subcategories displayed

72
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.920
over here and click on electronics.

73
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.020
And you can see we have just electronics displayed over here and we have this test.

74
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.920
We see a subcategory and you know where that is coming from, right?

75
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.700
Okay.

76
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.380
Now what we can then do is we can make our codes more more cleaner.

77
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.910
Instead of having this year, we can just get rid of it.

78
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.200
I think it's NCA.

79
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.820
Did it.

80
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.790
And so we copy first and delete.

81
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.510
Okay.

82
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.650
And.

83
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.660
Over a year.

84
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.090
Over here.

85
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:55.530
We can then create a function and we can call this function select main.

86
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.630
Category.

87
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.780
Okay.

88
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.980
We have to pass the value of the value of whatsoever.

89
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.000
This is going to choose.

90
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.150
And it is a type of string and can be nor.

91
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.690
Okay.

92
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.050
Enough is this.

93
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.050
You can see that is why we have to pass the value.

94
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.010
Get rid of it over here and you're going to see this is going to be undefined.

95
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.590
Okay.

96
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.560
So that's why we have to pass it over there.

97
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.270
It's necessary.

98
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.850
Right.

99
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.490
So we are basically saying if the value is equal to demand, we want to update the subcategory list

100
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.250
to demand elseif is equal to we meant.

101
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.220
We then want to update the subcategory list to women.

102
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.770
And so as if electronics, if you want to do for the rest, you just have to use the save again and

103
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.480
so on.

104
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.780
That's how you do for the kids, the accessories and others.

105
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.730
Look for the numbers to go with this theory.

106
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.600
And now we have to call the select main category.

107
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.420
Select main category.

108
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.500
Where are you?

109
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.200
Where are you?

110
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.150
Where are you?

111
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.110
Where are you?

112
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.550
Okay.

113
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.250
I can't be able to select.

114
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.700
Main.

115
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.090
Select me category and this.

116
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.830
Okay.

117
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.130
Also, we start this.

118
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.910
But we start in.

119
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.180
We just have to wait for it and hopefully understand.

120
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.410
But definitely, I know this is very confusing at this point.

121
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:33.600
Okay.

122
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.880
It's going towards we start this.

123
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.720
Okay.

124
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.070
And not to change.

125
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.020
Click on it, man.

126
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.810
And so I want to upload four.

127
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.980
I want to upload the product.

128
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.570
Right?

129
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:55.020
So the first thing is to select the main category and I'm uploading a main related clause so I can choose

130
00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:01.110
this man and I want to upload sheds for the man category.

131
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.560
Right.

132
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.070
This shed we have sheds, we have t shirt jackets, it's just called vest and shot so I can choose this

133
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.670
shirt.

134
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.240
Okay.

135
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.740
You can see since.

136
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.220
Good.
