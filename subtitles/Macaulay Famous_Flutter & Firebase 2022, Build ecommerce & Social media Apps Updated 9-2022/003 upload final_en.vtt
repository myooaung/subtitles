00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.920
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.670
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lecture, we're going to call this function card of the product.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.580
Okay.

5
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.820
Well, before then, I think we have to use this variable.

6
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.260
I'll probably already have.

7
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.950
It's in yours.

8
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.130
Okay, so there's going to be dialogue you have to have.

9
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.820
Right.

10
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.120
Dollar General.

11
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.620
Okay.

12
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.000
Contract to save.

13
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.690
Okay.

14
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.700
Now, what you're going to need to do is to call that function.

15
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.100
Okay, to call that function.

16
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.880
We are going to need to go to the upload screen.

17
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:37.750
Okay, upload screen and now we can use control and B now the first step is to have access to that function.

18
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.140
Right?

19
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.190
I know that's how I persisted.

20
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.850
That function.

21
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.310
We need to have access to that class.

22
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:51.940
So what we can do is we can initialize it over here so we can say find our upload what's for docs controller.

23
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.170
Okay.

24
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.900
And we can see the variable name is going to be upload for that controller and is going to be core to

25
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.790
upload for that.

26
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.940
I think you've seen this before, right, of the product controller and nobody can add a semicolon.

27
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.880
So we just have to take this.

28
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.570
Okay.

29
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.990
Okay.

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.720
Now the next thing is to have access to it's already available.

31
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.320
We can just do that over here so we can as well create a function called upload for that.

32
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.100
This is going to be similar to that of the signup you sent us before.

33
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.580
Okay.

34
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.630
The reason.

35
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.820
Yeah.

36
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.120
Wait, so we need to use the async and now we can call that function code.

37
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.890
We can just go ahead and see how it is going to take some time and we can.

38
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.230
Call that function now.

39
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.760
So that's variable.

40
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.460
Upload.

41
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.360
What's.

42
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.730
Of you'd.

43
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.450
Good controller.

44
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.670
Can't.

45
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.220
To learn that words.

46
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.460
The dart.

47
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.930
Dart, of course, is asking for this values rights ready created fields.

48
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.550
Right.

49
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.090
So he's asking for the values.

50
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.610
So this is going to be what?

51
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.440
Sorry, get rid of.

52
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.420
This is going to be underscored for docs.

53
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.520
Hi to.

54
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.660
This product types to think.

55
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.610
Yeah.

56
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.470
The Church.

57
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.270
Tests.

58
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.630
Okay.

59
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.340
Now that you have access to the value.

60
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.500
Okay.

61
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.190
And.

62
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.350
I think so.

63
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.630
I'm just going to do this.

64
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.570
Okay for the tie to this core product.

65
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.510
Try to.

66
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.270
Controller.

67
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.120
Controller.

68
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.770
Then start.

69
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.570
Test.

70
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.170
Okay.

71
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.550
Now, as I told you, it's going to be something similar.

72
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.760
I think we have that.

73
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.530
Okay.

74
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.800
The tests.

75
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.940
We're just going to check what we called that.

76
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.420
Okay.

77
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.370
On transit to coffee and.

78
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.140
Is this okay?

79
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.580
Okay.

80
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.600
That's all it is going to be the same ten for the ID.

81
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.740
So what we can do is we can paste this and then see the test.

82
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.790
Okay.

83
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.050
Now we don't yet have for the price and products category name and order.

84
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.500
So what we can do is we can create the controllers in that to get those fields.

85
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.370
Okay.

86
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.140
So we can just do this quickly over here.

87
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.280
So it is going to be fine and test at it's in.

88
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.930
Test it.

89
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.290
It's a controller on this call price.

90
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.650
You can just it for that price.

91
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.120
Controller is required to test and detain.

92
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.890
Test at its end.

93
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.740
Controller.

94
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.830
So what we can just do is we can copy this and paste.

95
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.210
This is going to be words, description.

96
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.209
Controller.

97
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.070
This.

98
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.030
Shun contract.

99
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.510
Okay.

100
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.720
And this is going to be what's.

101
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.310
Quantity.

102
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.000
On.

103
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.120
Korn.

104
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.850
See C controller.

105
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.470
Okay.

106
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.130
And.

107
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.270
This is going to reward.

108
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.650
We have heard.

109
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.440
Okay.

110
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.480
I think there's is going to be what we I just want check this out first of all let's just bind each

111
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.440
to the values.

112
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.000
So this is squad's prize ready for the tie two.

113
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.400
So way we can see a controller and a prize controller.

114
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.650
Okay.

115
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.610
And.

116
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.770
And.

117
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.620
And and.

118
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.450
And and and and.

119
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.680
Okay.

120
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.690
I think we're ready for the category as well.

121
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.610
Sue Valley.

122
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.130
So why is this level of control another score category?

123
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.250
Category.

124
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.530
I think, okay, we don't have anything like that.

125
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.060
We can just say category controller.

126
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.650
They say we're going to create it.

127
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.100
Okay.

128
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.810
And.

129
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.510
Controller on this court's discretion.

130
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.110
Description controller Kay and over year.

131
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.650
Controller and underscore client.

132
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.880
G g controller.

133
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.320
Okay.

134
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.480
I think that should be asked.

135
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.480
What we can do is to create that for we don't yet add for our for the category.

136
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.890
So this is going to be on this category controller.

137
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.200
Okay.

138
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.500
You can see the is gone.

139
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.910
Okay, great.

140
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.170
Now you're going to use this as the values to those fields.

141
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.310
Okay.

142
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.350
So we can just click on this.

143
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.050
Okay.

144
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.680
I was asking for the prize so this could be what others call prize.

145
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.000
Controller.

146
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.370
The tests.

147
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.980
Okay.

148
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.720
And for the category name we call this category controller.

149
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.550
And to get it, you just have to see the test and.

150
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.000
For the discussion as well.

151
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.400
So on this score.

152
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.990
On this car description.

153
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.980
Description.

154
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.280
Controller and evaluate the test.

155
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.540
Okay.

156
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.650
For the quantity and underscore quantity.

157
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.290
On city comptroller.

158
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.030
The tests.

159
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.570
So we need a common view and.

160
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.440
Tests.

161
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.080
Okay.

162
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.370
Now for the image of El Red, you have the global viable rights.

163
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.020
You know, all the doors probably you can just go back to those lectures.

164
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.410
Okay.

165
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.550
We can have this.

166
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.970
Okay.

167
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.360
This is basically it.

168
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.310
Okay.

169
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.260
This basically is.

170
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.160
Okay.

171
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.900
Okay.

172
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.360
Okay.

173
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.510
Now, we gonna need to call this function.

174
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.020
What?

175
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.290
I can just disease control an F and to search for that upload.

176
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.500
Okay, there's a two way.

177
00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.840
You probably don't have this in yours, so you can just get rid of this in this and call that upload.

178
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.050
Upload what products?

179
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.430
Okay.

180
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.370
We can just get rid of the parenthesis, additional comma, and now you can.

181
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.460
Let's just start this.

182
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.340
Okay.

183
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.440
But she starts in and.

184
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.930
Now all we can do before then is we can just get rid of the products.

185
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.790
You can just delete this collection since we don't have it is automatically going to create it.

186
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.720
So products really don't need to delete it though.

187
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.059
Okay.

188
00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.309
But we can't just delete it.

189
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.909
Okay.

190
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:35.900
Deleted.

191
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.440
Okay.

192
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.750
Okay.

193
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.409
Okay.

194
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:43.740
Okay.

195
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.100
Okay.

196
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.760
Okay, okay.

197
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.570
Okay, okay.

198
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.420
What are we going to do now and.

199
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.090
Okay, now we need to try this out.

200
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.390
Right?

201
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:51.780
Okay.

202
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.390
Now we don't have any products and we can upload.

203
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.810
Okay.

204
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.580
For the gallery.

205
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.730
I'm going to pick this.

206
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.180
Okay.

207
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.190
Now you're ignore those control are those.

208
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:04.880
Okay.

209
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.190
So we can't just say go see.

210
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.630
And for the price we can get someone to say it's $40.

211
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:19.850
And for the category, this is going to be close and you can see best selling clothes.

212
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.770
Okay.

213
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.780
For the quantity.

214
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.800
There are certain quotas for the quantity.

215
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.630
We can just say we have two of the scores of four probably.

216
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.010
Okay.

217
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:40.370
Now click on upload and that's good check out seminar if we got any error.

218
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.020
Okay.

219
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.140
I think it has been loaded.

220
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:50.180
We can just come to this and go back to this and that's that's what's got a refresh occur.

221
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.380
You can see it over here.

222
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.010
Okay.

223
00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:00.010
This is basically it's like you can see it's way easier to do this since you have a knowledge.

224
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.730
You can see they're still closed out as a section we had at the time, too.

225
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.990
Yeah.

226
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.070
It's I'd sit on the.

227
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.650
The tides and the height is the same.

228
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.830
The hemisphere of hell.

229
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.580
The prize.

230
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.290
The product's category name is close.

231
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.670
Now we are not going to see this and the whole screen.

232
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.510
Right.

233
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.090
Because we have an error, actually.

234
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:33.170
You can see the reason for this area is because it's trying to say this is not a string.

235
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.740
Of our year.

236
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.760
Okay, so what we can just do for the now, we can just get rid of this.

237
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.510
And just say 40.

238
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.240
It spent a double so we can say 42 zero.

239
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.310
It had it true cover.

240
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.230
Okay.

241
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.610
Okay.

242
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.140
Now, what is saying this is I spit in this drink, right?

243
00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:01.720
And okay, now all we can just do is you're going to need to go to the.

244
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.370
What's the controller's dietary?

245
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.410
Quite close and over a year.

246
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:19.140
Over here, you can see we are specifying that it must be a string and somehow it is fit in number because

247
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.510
in the models we also specify that what it is is going to be a double.

248
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.950
You can sit over here.

249
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.460
You can see why I said the quantity is going to be ain't and this price is going to be double.

250
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.230
So what we can do is so over the controls that I try.

251
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.000
Controllers.

252
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:41.770
So what we can do.

253
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.770
We can use too far to say it can be any type of variable.

254
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.300
Okay.

255
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.250
And over the quantity we can as well use the var.

256
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.760
Okay.

257
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.940
Okay.

258
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.300
Now let's go back to.

259
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.360
This.

260
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.550
Okay.

261
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.980
Rise and 40.

262
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.980
That's zero.

263
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.040
We still have an error.

264
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.200
Okay.

265
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.000
Now all we can do is.

266
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.130
We can.

267
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.450
Okay.

268
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.010
Sorry.

269
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.940
Not in the order, but in the projects.

270
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.870
Okay.

271
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.520
Sorry.

272
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.550
So there's going to be 40 to 0, right?

273
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.670
And additional comma and where we can just.

274
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.580
54.

275
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.320
Now, you're going to sort out this later.

276
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.010
Okay.

277
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.280
I think we need this and this.

278
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.660
Okay.

279
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.580
Now let's are three this.

280
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:51.950
Okay.

281
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.360
You can see we are having the error before.

282
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.590
But it is going to go off.

283
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.070
Shut me.

284
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.720
Okay.

285
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.280
Okay.

286
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.550
Now let's check.

287
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.350
We don't have an error, actually.

288
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:05.670
Okay.

289
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.390
You can see the products we just uploaded and go check this.

290
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.340
You can see the here and.

291
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.920
Check this.

292
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.950
You can see no products because we have we specified when uploading it.

293
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.460
Okay.

294
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.560
So this is basically it.

295
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.490
Right.

296
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.260
I think this is very easy.

297
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.060
Okay.

298
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:33.200
So over here for the now, we got just using 40 to 0 as the double type of price.

299
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.810
And I would just say quantities 50.

300
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.810
We are going to sort out this later.

301
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.210
Okay?

302
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.460
Okay, guys, see you.

303
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.330
And in this lecture.
