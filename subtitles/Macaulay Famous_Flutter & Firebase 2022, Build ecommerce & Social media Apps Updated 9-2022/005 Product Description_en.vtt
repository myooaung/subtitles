00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.320
In this lecture, we are going to display the product description, but before then we are going to

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.440
have a test over here which is going to say item description, okay, not to do this.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.040
The test is going to look very similar to that of the test we have in the profile screen.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.090
So what we can do is we can copy it like this repeated divider.

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.490
And you can see we have this raw widget and we can copy from this to this part over here and use and

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900
to copy and back to the detail screen.

9
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.420
Product detail and how you newcomer.

10
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.630
And then we're going to paste it right there.

11
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.750
And over here, we have to change this title.

12
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.250
To say, heighten this corruption.

13
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.810
Okay.

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.990
Click on this and see what we are missing.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.700
I think we have to get rid of that.

16
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.300
This country needs to save and go check it out.

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
You're going to see a test of DNA, which is going to say item description.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.830
And you can see basically we have we are using a row and we have a size box basically for the divider.

19
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.110
And you can see we are saying the thickness is going to be one and the color is going to be colors that

20
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.500
gray.

21
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.700
And we are saying main axes alignment means us alignment of center to take it to the center.

22
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.310
Okay.

23
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.300
And now we can then have another test.

24
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
What we can just do is we can copy this test.

25
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.400
And we're going to pace this right after the road.

26
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.840
Right.

27
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.380
Okay.

28
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.260
Is this and get rid of this.

29
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.320
And we have to call the product list, variable product list.

30
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.770
And now we can then say product description.

31
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.770
Ed.

32
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:15.200
Sorry, I just turned a corner and used Katrina as a save and go check it out.

33
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.060
Okay.

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.830
Okay.

35
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.210
Now you can see we can't screw.

36
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.860
Right.

37
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.770
So what we can then do is we can grab this column widget with a widget known as single child scroll

38
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.940
view wrap with widget and single child.

39
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.780
Single child screw view and use control and save.

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.300
And now we are going to be able to screw.

41
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.170
Okay.

42
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.450
Okay.

43
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.210
Some school.

44
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.370
Right.

45
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.860
And what we could also do is this test which at.

46
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.310
We can wrap it with a pardon.

47
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.800
And maybe for all sides.

48
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.200
We can just go with the age old side.

49
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.000
Age is okay.

50
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.980
Okay.

51
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.320
Okay.

52
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.130
Sounds cool.

53
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.180
And we can also have for the similar products.

54
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.550
So we can copy this again.

55
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.940
Copy this.

56
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.130
Again, it ends over here.

57
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.790
And right after the pardon.

58
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.450
Right.

59
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.240
This this and this is going to say.

60
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.600
See Miller.

61
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.870
Similar.

62
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.880
Item.

63
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.800
Okay.

64
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.750
Okay.

65
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.610
Scroll down.

66
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.810
Okay.

67
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.730
Also, we can change the color of this test.

68
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.800
CALLER.

69
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.970
Where are you?

70
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.980
Where are you?

71
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.880
Okay, Carlos, that's great.

72
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.920
We could just say sorry.

73
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.990
Not that, but over here, we could just say it because.

74
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.770
A sign.

75
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.240
And over here, instead of green, we can say colors the sign in its control and ask to save.

76
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.930
Okay.

77
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.650
Okay.

78
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:35.430
And now what we can then do for now we can just return the products under the similar item.

79
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:44.970
So to do that outside this room, we are going to have a sized sized box and a child.

80
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.330
Then the child is going to be the stream view stream viewer.

81
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.750
So what we can just do, head back to the main, main gallery or women or shows anyone.

82
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.950
Then we are going to copy this computer.

83
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.370
And it's ends over here.

84
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.230
Okay.

85
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.340
And paste.

86
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.590
Okay.

87
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.480
I think we have to get rid of that comma.

88
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.150
Sorry.

89
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.270
And comma.

90
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.930
And what we have to do is to import it, import this.

91
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.870
We also have to import the product model, and we also have to import this.

92
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.450
Okay.

93
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.620
Click on this.

94
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.760
We also do have to import those query snapshots.

95
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.510
And also you can see this is not found.

96
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.720
So what we have to do, again, is to.

97
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.700
Copy this.

98
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.160
Copy this.

99
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.470
And back to the product screen.

100
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.460
And.

101
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.110
We are going to paste this right over here.

102
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.970
Okay.

103
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.710
Sounds good.

104
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.310
And for now, we can just return all our products, or maybe we can just go with this for now and in

105
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.940
the future, we are going to be able to filter similar products.

106
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.560
Okay.

107
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.860
Now use control and save.

108
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.580
Okay.

109
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.310
It will take some time.

110
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.020
Okay.

111
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.620
Sims.

112
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.350
Cool.

113
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:31.120
So as you can see, we are basically featuring for the main cuts, sorry for the main category.

114
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.320
Or we could just get rid of this right now to display all our products.

115
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.930
Or we can just go with this one now.

116
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.170
Okay.

117
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.840
Sounds good.

118
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:46.970
So similar to like I said, in the future, we are going to be able to filter a similar item.

119
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.470
But for now, we are basically just returning the main category.

120
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.700
Look, you can see the men category.

121
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.900
Okay.

122
00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.760
Okay.

123
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.930
We can just check other product to make sure it's working as expected.

124
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.300
It's going to go back and.

125
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.960
Sorry.

126
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.420
We basically just have to maybe hold we start this.

127
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.480
Continue from here.

128
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.130
Okay, guys, see you.
