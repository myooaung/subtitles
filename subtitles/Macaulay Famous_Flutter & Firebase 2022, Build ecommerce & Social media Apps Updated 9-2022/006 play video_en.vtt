00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.589
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.990
In this lecture, we're going to play the video.

4
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.380
Okay.

5
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.970
Now, to do this, we can now get rid of this center widget.

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.620
And we're going to be using the widget called Single Child Scroll View.

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.130
And the reason for this is we want to be able to screw the the screen page.

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.490
Right.

9
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.880
Okay.

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.850
Now, as you know, this has a child and the child is going to be a color widget in it.

11
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.960
That's a make.

12
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.440
All our widgets been displayed vertically.

13
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.960
That is from top to bottom.

14
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.470
Okay.

15
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.770
And I think this bodes well.

16
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.450
Okay.

17
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.390
There's going to be child rights chide and column.

18
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.630
Hopefully my spelling's correct.

19
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.580
Okay.

20
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.190
Come on.

21
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.000
Okay.

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.270
We can have the children.

23
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.680
Okay.

24
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.740
Now, the first child is going to be a size box, you know?

25
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.520
Like it isn't.

26
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.260
It gives this space vertically.

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.430
Okay, size works, and we can use height of 30.

28
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.910
Okay.

29
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.230
And now we can have another size box for the video so we can adjust the size bus.

30
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.250
Okay.

31
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.460
Now what we can see, we can see weeds.

32
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.390
Then we're going to make the video occupy the full weight of the screen.

33
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.460
Now, we asked to do it from left to right.

34
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.910
Right.

35
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.170
Okay.

36
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.700
That is our.

37
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.730
Why is it going to be.

38
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.610
Now, to do that, we're going to need to get the width of the screen.

39
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.070
So we're going to need to say media query.

40
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.860
Dot of contest, dot size.

41
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.990
Dot.

42
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.890
Weitz Okay, so this is going to give us the weight of the screen.

43
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.830
So we want our video to take the full width.

44
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.270
Okay.

45
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.620
We can also have the height.

46
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.960
We can also get the height of our screen by a media query that's of.

47
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.870
That's half.

48
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.650
Contest, the size, the tweet.

49
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.720
Sorry, the hides bots.

50
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.750
This time, though, that's how it's okay.

51
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.660
What is the revenue divide?

52
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.690
It's by.

53
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.640
1.5 because we are also going to have the capture that is the successful field.

54
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.560
Okay, so great.

55
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.100
And now we can't have.

56
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.340
A child.

57
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.770
The child is going to be a video player, which we had earlier installed.

58
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.050
Right.

59
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.550
A video player.

60
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.280
Okay.

61
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.180
Now, you can see over here we have a variable rate card controller and where we use.

62
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.530
We use Delete because we don't want to initialize it at the moment and why it are initializing it and

63
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.390
we are passing the video.

64
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.080
Fi you can see over here.

65
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.400
I think I'm just going to do this.

66
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.630
Okay.

67
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.920
The idea.

68
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.040
There.

69
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.210
And over the past 18.

70
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.050
The controller.

71
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.840
Okay, great.

72
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.760
Okay.

73
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.970
Hopefully there is an error.

74
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.380
Okay.

75
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.400
Now the nesting now is you can see we have this two variables, right?

76
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.820
And the next thing to do is to pass in the values.

77
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.740
So this to the variables we have.

78
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.160
Okay.

79
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.620
Now we are going to go back to the heart of the screen and one true and B now the first we need is the

80
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.770
video fi and is going to be fi.

81
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.080
Make sure you are imported from the high.

82
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.600
Knots is still small.

83
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.470
Please.

84
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.770
Okay.

85
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.580
So you can use contraband dots and you're going to see that io and dot esteem.

86
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.140
Okay.

87
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.290
Idea of mind.

88
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.120
Okay, so there's going to be fi.

89
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.650
Okay.

90
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.090
Phi Phi and we can then see video the parts to give us the parts of the video.

91
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.170
Okay.

92
00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.980
Now as well.

93
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.360
This is going to be video.

94
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.360
And we can't simply say a video.

95
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.180
Video, the art part.

96
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.080
Okay, great.

97
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.210
This was let's.

98
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.780
Okay.

99
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.150
So we are passing this to values.

100
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.230
So that's two variables we have in the control screen.

101
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.860
Okay.

102
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.839
Now, so we can let's just add this.

103
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.310
Make sure you restate this.

104
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.660
Don't just use concreteness save as saving to get it.

105
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.940
You're going to get a shocking error.

106
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.170
Okay.

107
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.090
So what we can just do is you can check this out and see.

108
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.900
If it works and not, but definitely is going to work with that hair.

109
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.970
Okay.

110
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.860
So we can hopefully it needs to all to start this app.

111
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.690
Okay.

112
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.650
Okay, great.

113
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.510
Now we can see had video.

114
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.000
Aside from a gallery.

115
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.110
Gallery.

116
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.520
Gallery, gallery, gallery.

117
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.680
Then I can just speak.

118
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.110
This.

119
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.640
Okay.

120
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.980
Okay, great.

121
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.500
So you can see the height we had dividing it by whites wanted five.

122
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.900
So you can see the space over here.

123
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.480
We can have the capture and okay, you can see this easily.

124
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.060
It is simply a video in flutter like you can see like AdSense guys do.

125
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.190
We can just look.

126
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.360
Okay, guys?

127
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.100
Yeah.

128
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.290
Seeing the anesthesia.
