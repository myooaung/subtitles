00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.780
Hi.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.720
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.750
In this lecture, we are going to have validation to our test form fields.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.010
Okay, I'm going to screw up and we have this first test form field for the price.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:22.650
And as you know, the test for field as a property known as validator and parentheses, that is going

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.250
to take in the value which is referring to the input of the user.

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.980
And now we can have an if statement.

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.800
We can say value dot.

9
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.620
That is that is empty.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.250
A value that is empty.

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.680
We need to check of via.

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340
A that is empty.

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.760
Then we want to return.

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.390
We want to return a test which is going to say, please, price must not be empty.

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.200
And see.

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.830
Okay.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.750
Else.

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.040
If it is filled in, then we want to let the user go.

19
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.540
Okay.

20
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.840
And what we can simply do is copy this.

21
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.360
And is this over?

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.840
Yeah.

23
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.280
Within the test phone field.

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.950
And this is going to be quantity.

25
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.140
Quan Quan t.

26
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.310
T and pays this over year.

27
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:36.340
This is going to be please product name must not be M.C. and lastly.

28
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.330
We have to pace this over here.

29
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.410
And this is going to say, please description.

30
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.090
Description shot, not the empty.

31
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.920
Okay, then that's you know, that's a make.

32
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.290
This validates our work.

33
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.260
We have to create a form key.

34
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.980
Right.

35
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.980
So we tend to states, we can go ahead and say finder and it's going to find us.

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.660
Sorry, it's going to be a type of global low key.

37
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.610
And farm state.

38
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.350
And what we can do, we can make this available private by using the underscore and form key is going

39
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.250
to be equal to global.

40
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.480
Glover a key.

41
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.710
And.

42
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.300
Farm state.

43
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.690
Okay.

44
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.360
Great.

45
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.960
Hopefully you're mastering the process.

46
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.800
Right.

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.540
Okay.

48
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.060
And what we have to do now is to rob the parent column with.

49
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.930
A farm.

50
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.940
The reason for this is because we want to be able to have access to the key property.

51
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.090
So a light and wrap with we don't have that over here so we can wrap with form and now we have access

52
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.770
to a property like Key and now we can bind it with this form key.

53
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.570
Okay, great.

54
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.660
And now where we have the upload function, we have the upload function of via.

55
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.170
We can then have another check.

56
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.820
We can then say if.

57
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.980
On this call from QI.

58
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.690
I think you've seen all this before.

59
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.850
By this time, you're going to master it.

60
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.420
Okay.

61
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.460
The current state.

62
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.640
So in its current current context.

63
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.450
But current state thought is validated.

64
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.780
If it is validated, we also do need a no check of a.

65
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.790
If it is validated, then what we want to do is for now we are going to print something says.

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.640
We are just going to say, cool.

67
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.180
Else if it is not validated.

68
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.110
We then want to return our snack bar.

69
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.200
Snack bar.

70
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.150
Snack bar.

71
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.750
And we can maybe say please feels.

72
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.740
Fields.

73
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.940
If this field must not be left empty.

74
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.190
Okay.

75
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.300
Had your semicolon and used control less ANOVA.

76
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.060
Yeah, you can see we have this quantity field.

77
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.070
The quantity.

78
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.060
And price.

79
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.640
What we can do is we can specify the type of inputs we are expecting to do that within the telephone

80
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.990
field.

81
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:46.380
It has a property known as keyboard and this is going to be test inputs type and we need the number.

82
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.020
Okay.

83
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.360
We're going to do this for the price.

84
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.020
Okay.

85
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.780
And it has a property known as keyboards type and this is going to be test imputes.

86
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.210
Type world number.

87
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.470
Okay.

88
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.360
Control, NASA save.

89
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.010
And try this out.

90
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.750
If you click on this upload, you can see, please, fields must not be left empty.

91
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.960
And you can see all this validation we have.

92
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.330
Okay, now click on the price and you can see it's going to switch on the number of keyboard and same.

93
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.930
It's gonna switch the number of keyboard to add the quantity and to add price since.

94
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.410
Good.

95
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.280
This is good.

96
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.100
What about all this other fields?

97
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.870
To an.

98
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.590
This.

99
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.240
This is going to have it says over.

100
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.630
And test and then click on this.

101
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.970
Okay.

102
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.330
Click on this.

103
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.810
Sorry upload.

104
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.270
Okay.

105
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.040
You can see it is currently valid.

106
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.000
Okay.

107
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.530
Let's go check our seminar and hopefully we are going to see cool over there.

108
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.270
Look it cool.

109
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.940
I think you've seen all this before.

110
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.690
So by this time around, you're going to master it?

111
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.010
I think it is not speed.

112
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.160
You won't understand everything at the moment, but consistency would help you.

113
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.540
So I believe as you keep on repeating it, repeating it, definitely you understand and you will be

114
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.950
able to do it on your own.

115
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.060
Okay.

116
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.740
Okay, guys.

117
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.270
See you at the next lecture.
