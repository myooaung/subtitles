00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.910
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.940
Walker in this lecture.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.440
Users are going to be able to click on this minus in order to reduce the cops item.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.020
Okay.

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.170
Not to do this, they're going to need to go back to our via C code and then the costs provider fi.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.860
Okay.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.790
Now we can then use control and B not to make this wide.

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.240
Okay.

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.980
Now, this is going to be so similar to this.

10
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.620
We can easily just copy, but I'm going to be doing this from scratch in order for you to master all

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.310
the process.

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:32.729
Okay.

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.200
Now, why you.

14
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
We're going to create a new method, or we can simply call it a function.

15
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.240
Okay.

16
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.820
So this is going to be void and we will call this reduce costs.

17
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.650
I said okay as well is going to take in all those fields.

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.090
Okay.

19
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.770
Care or.

20
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.220
This is going to be strange for drop ID and double.

21
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.170
Price and string.

22
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.940
Try to.

23
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.940
And String image Jarrell.

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.650
Okay.

25
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.130
Great.

26
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.410
Now the next thing we are going to do is we are going to check if it's us or whether we have that.

27
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.410
Then we just want to minus one from it.

28
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.830
Okay.

29
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:35.930
So there really is an if statement if on the scorecards it says does.

30
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.880
Let's think.

31
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.460
Okay.

32
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.860
It says does.

33
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.770
Contain.

34
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.840
Keys.

35
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.400
Then you enough to check.

36
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.360
Regular check.

37
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.280
Based on the product ID.

38
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.290
If we're to have that product I.D., that's Mace ready to have it in our cart.

39
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.790
Right.

40
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.210
Okay.

41
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.450
Okay if it's started, if it is already dead, if it is already been added.

42
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.770
Right.

43
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.170
Okay.

44
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.760
Okay, then you're going to see cards on this call.

45
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.120
Cards, items, dots of dates.

46
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.550
Okay.

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.420
As well.

48
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.590
We are going to check based on the product ID.

49
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.060
And now.

50
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.530
Is going to be so products.

51
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.060
I'd.

52
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.920
Okay.

53
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.700
And rename this to existing.

54
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.610
Cards.

55
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.730
I said, okay.

56
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.480
Okay.

57
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.740
Okay.

58
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.780
And now we're going to return.

59
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.530
The court achievement.

60
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.810
Okay.

61
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.320
Great.

62
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.620
Now for the I.D., this is going to be assistant.

63
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.140
As is the cards.

64
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.150
I turn the odds.

65
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.560
I'd.

66
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860
As well for the title.

67
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.710
There's going to be assists in cards.

68
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.460
I can start tied to.

69
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.650
Okay.

70
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.470
I think.

71
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.530
Okay, for the quantity here, there's going to be.

72
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.190
Minus one.

73
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.820
Okay.

74
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.640
Great.

75
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.130
Okay.

76
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.360
For the price is going to be assisted.

77
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.470
Cards.

78
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.160
I send the card price.

79
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.460
Look for the image URL.

80
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.060
There's going to be assistance cards.

81
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.200
I turn the lights.

82
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.110
Image.

83
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.690
Jarrell okay.

84
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.720
Great.

85
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.470
Now we are simply saying if the product has already had that by us, we just want to update it and we

86
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.589
want to do commence it by one.

87
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.130
Okay.

88
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.420
Now what we're going to do, you can see, is so similar.

89
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.410
So this.

90
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.760
Right.

91
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.820
Okay, contrariness.

92
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.330
Now we're going to go back to the cards.

93
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.280
I ten screen.

94
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.840
Okay.

95
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.650
You really are going to look after for the minus sign.

96
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.400
Okay.

97
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.940
Okay.

98
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.800
Digital via.

99
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.160
So they're going to say on the score.

100
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.730
Card provider.

101
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.520
Dutch reduce cards at I.

102
00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.360
Okay.

103
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.830
You can see it automatically past the product id is going to be on the score card provider and.

104
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.230
The arts.

105
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.940
I think so.

106
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.870
On the scorecards attribute.

107
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.790
Dutch fries.

108
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.540
Okay.

109
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.330
On the scorecards achievement.

110
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.280
Dutch.

111
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.640
How to.

112
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.720
And on the scorecards Archibald's.

113
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.090
That's immaterial.

114
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.750
Okay.

115
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.720
Now, I'm not saying we need to do this.

116
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.440
I don't know.

117
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.190
Keep track of the changes the user is making to the courts.

118
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.520
Okay.

119
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.170
Now, to do this, we need to have to notify list now.

120
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.340
Okay.

121
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.770
Right to.

122
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.630
Over here.

123
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.640
Now they need to call the.

124
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.080
Not of fly.

125
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.110
Listen to the copy.

126
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.650
Okay.

127
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.370
There's a delay.

128
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.560
Okay.

129
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.140
Okay.

130
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.600
Now use control and save.

131
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.300
Okay.

132
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.620
Now click on this.

133
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.930
Okay.

134
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.050
You can see, uh, TV.

135
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.420
Okay.

136
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.700
Okay.

137
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.330
I think this is not going okay.

138
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.570
So this is going to be as this ten.

139
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.580
As I sit cause I tend it's quantity then minus one.

140
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.050
Okay.

141
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.640
Okay.

142
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.450
Now.

Let me check again.

149
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.520
Is that right?

150
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.130
We can get eight, seven, six, five.

151
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.090
Four.

152
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.170
Okay.

153
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.980

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.510
Okay.

155
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.800
Now he's controlling this to save.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.400
Okay, guys, I think we ought to call.

157
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.850
It's over a year.

158
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.650
The spirit of the game.

159
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.860
Oh, we're just going to start this.

160
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.480
So to make sure everything is working okay.

161
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.120
Okay.

162
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.510
Where does it end?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.090
So let's just check it out first.

164
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.580
Okay.

But look, we have won.

168
00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.500
We didn't have to.

169
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.890
Yeah, one.

170
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:39.240
Okay.

171
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:42.580
