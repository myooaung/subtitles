00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.359
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.610
Walker In this lecture, we are going to create the bottom navigation bar.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.100
Okay, now know that to do this over this curious directory, we are going to need to create a new PHI

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.130
and we're going to call this Phi home on this screen.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.660
And then there's texture.

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.350
Dot, dot.

7
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:16.800
Okay.

8
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, we can just go ahead.

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.200
I use this table as we did.

10
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.330
And since we can later change the set for widgets if the needs arises.

11
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.070
Okay, as well, we can call this the screen.

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.770
Then over here you're going need to add light and use controlled dots in order to import the material

13
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.820
that that package.

14
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.210
Okay.

15
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.420
Now, in know that's a have access to lots of property.

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.730
What we can do is get rid of this container and then use it scaffold widgets.

17
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.170
Okay.

18
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.710
Great.

19
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.040
Now what we can also do is when the user clicks on this button, if no errors, then we want to be able

20
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.270
to navigate to user to this on screen.

21
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.560
Okay.

22
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.500
Now to do this, we're gonna need to go to the login screen and after this all, we just have to say

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.640
so after this.

24
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.140
All we just have to see is.

25
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.630
Over here.

26
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.680
We can then see.

27
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.630
Now the gates are.

28
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.830
Thoughts off contest.

29
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.550
The off contest is deferring to our current position and currently we are in the login screen.

30
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.610
Okay.

31
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.260
And.

32
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.830
That's push.

33
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.100
Okay.

34
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.930
We want to be able to push these over to the next page.

35
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.370
Okay.

36
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.190
And this is going to be something like this, Matt.

37
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.730
Syria.

38
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.710
Matt Syria.

39
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.590
Matt See we are page roots okay as well.

40
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.800
This is no taking contest and we can specify the type is a type of beauty contest.

41
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.150
Okay, Michelle, give you a space.

42
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.510
We can just use control and B to make this way.

43
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.910
Okay.

44
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.030
In the way.

45
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.350
Contest.

46
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.910
Sorry.

47
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.140
Okay.

48
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.000
This.

49
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.850
And over here we need to say written home screen.

50
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.320
Okay.

51
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.699
Now, how to start this?

52
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.160
Okay.

53
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.900
Hotz, we start this.

54
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.540
And.

55
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.580
You're going to need to wait for this.

56
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.410
Okay.

57
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.160
Okay.

58
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.550
Okay.

59
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.940
Okay.

60
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.300
Okay.

61
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.930
Okay.

62
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay.

63
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.450
Okay.

64
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.930
Okay.

65
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.350
Okay.

66
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.830
Okay.

67
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.220
And now let's give it a try.

68
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.330
Now let's click on this.

69
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.590
Okay, look on this.

70
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.850
Okay.

71
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.240
You can see we are currently in the home screen.

72
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.660
Right.

73
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.070
Okay.

74
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.880
Okay.

75
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.190
Now to make sure is walk in.

76
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.840
Over the onscreen.

77
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.300
So.

78
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.870
Well that we can just out of the body and then a center with jets, which is gorgeous, which is just

79
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.680
going to stay home.

80
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.500
Smokescreen.

81
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.440
Okay.

82
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.800
So the sense I would get is going to take what's under the widgets is going to be a chart and test widgets,

83
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.610
everything.

84
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.670
Penny Flutter is referred to as widgets, right?

85
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.910
So it is since our widgets scaffold widgets as we did and so on.

86
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.060
So this is going to be home screen and the value I just say that we want to send to this.

87
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.950
This test.

88
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.170
We just because they just do something like this.

89
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.250
Something like this, right?

90
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.590
I can't.

91
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.130
So I guess they once they sent out this test, we get out of the arts.

92
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.060
So he is controlling this acerbic history.

93
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.100
I think we need to click this Mickey Casey on the screen.

94
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.880
Okay.

95
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.900
Sounds good.

96
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.130
Okay.

97
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.200
Now, like I said, it's in this lecture.

98
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.970
We're going to create the bottom navigation bar.

99
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.260
Right.

100
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.840
Okay, so now we take the scaffold.

101
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.160
The scaffold has a property known as bottom navigation bar.

102
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.630
And this is going to be bottom.

103
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.870
Navigation bar as well.

104
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.630
Okay.

105
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.220
Okay.

106
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.780
The boss of Navigation Bar has a property known as I-10, which is going to be a list of what's on that

107
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.400
sugar.

108
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.260
Okay.

109
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.260
That is how many bottom navigation bar we need.

110
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.710
Okay.

111
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.959
So it's going to be a list of bottom.

112
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:28.130
But navigation bar soy bottle addition bar I-10 look for the icons have it's poured over so I'm not

113
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.490
going to forget okay the first is going to be words icons does comment on the scope bank.

114
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.220
Okay.

115
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.280
I call widgets.

116
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.360
Right.

117
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.590
And then I cause the comments.

118
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.050
What is called bunk.

119
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.740
B and K and as well.

120
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.100
It's housed in labor and.

121
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.170
Okay.

122
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.470
Liver is what's meat and chat.

123
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.890
Okay.

124
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.490
Okay.

125
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.240
Meet.

126
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.080
And.

127
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.710
Chat.

128
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.170
Okay.

129
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.890
Now, if you save this, now you're going to get an error because it expects to add more item.

130
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.130
Okay.

131
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.290
So what we can do is we can use concurrency.

132
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.880
And here's this.

133
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.820
Okay.

134
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.810
One more time.

135
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.620
And use control and excessive and go check it out.

136
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.020
Okay.

137
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.000
I can see to that.

138
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.260
Right.

139
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.710
Okay.

140
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.560
Okay.

141
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.680
Now what we can do is we can then change the icons.

142
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.620
For each of them.

143
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.710
And the second check.

144
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.060
The second is going to be what?

145
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.600
Okay, I close the clock.

146
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.450
Clock, and Olivia is meeting.

147
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.080
I close that lock.

148
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.400
Lock.

149
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.670
Okay.

150
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.950
I closed that lock.

151
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.370
This clock.

152
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.180
Okay.

153
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.070
And the labor is muted.

154
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.120
Okay.

155
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.620
The third is words that had this person on this call at mine and contacts.

156
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.670
Okay.

157
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.890
Version of the score outlined in.

158
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.510
Cornstarch.

159
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.000
Hon.

160
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.810
Can't touch.

161
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.280
Okay.

162
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.970
I'm just going to check the spelling out.

163
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.270
A key contact for the.

164
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.870
Okay.

165
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.380
Or I can just do so for that.

166
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.310
Yes.

167
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.250
I have to copy this and.

168
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.400
Then paste.

169
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.120
Okay.

170
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.490
And the third is what?

171
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.390
The city's hotline.

172
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.860
Okay.

173
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.370
I calls.

174
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.630
That said, since.

175
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.910
I'll just call up and.

176
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.790
This is going to be what's.

177
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.890
Searches.

178
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.050
Okay.

179
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.160
I think we have.

180
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.260
One more.

181
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.520
Oh, right.

182
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:16.920
Okay.

183
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.820
Okay.

184
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.160
Now, what we can also do is over here.

185
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.310
We can just add that you come over here.

186
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.960
How did you come over here?

187
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.300
And over year and year.

188
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.660
You know, that's not a good format.

189
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.070
Okay.

190
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.760
