00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.810
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.850
In this lecture, we're going to make our data dynamic.

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.290
You can see for now we are having just this test which says men.

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
So what we can do, we can create a list of categories.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.940
Names like to do that over a year.

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.790
We can create a list.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.590
You can just go ahead and specify the type of variable it is a type of list.

9
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.960
And all these are tests.

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.710
So we could also go further and say we are sorry.

11
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.460
We are expecting strings.

12
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.040
And now we can call this.

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.360
I said, Well, maybe we could we could just say, let's call it, and it's going to be equal to this.

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.510
Sorry, no strings but string.

15
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.210
Okay.

16
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.400
And not just in McAllen.

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.120
And the first item is going to be man.

18
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.370
The second item can be women.

19
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.190
We can just use a capital letter.

20
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.410
And they said item could be maybe shoes.

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.440
And maybe kids got surgeries.

22
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.880
And maybe electronics.

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.050
And like.

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.210
True.

25
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.490
Next, hopefully I can spell that or you can just create that yourself.

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.470
Okay.

27
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.320
Now we are going to need to use this variable called.

28
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.870
Heighton writes, okay.

29
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.440
So instead of this, we can just get rid of this.

30
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.880
And on the score item, we are basically making this a private variable so we can't assess it as this

31
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.390
file.

32
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.300
And.

33
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.330
Had this and now we have to pass this index via.

34
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.160
In this.

35
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.710
Okay.

36
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.110
Just control and save now.

37
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.380
And go check it out.

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.060
You're going to see different categories.

39
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.240
Name over year.

40
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.550
Queue.

41
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.060
We just have to wait for this a bit.

42
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.050
Okay.

43
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.280
We have in this era.

44
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.390
And the reason for this era, you can see why we said we need.

45
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.170
Seven item, right.

46
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.680
And you can see it is not up to seven.

47
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.870
We basically have one, two, three, four, five.

48
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.110
So what we could also do, instead of using the static data, we could get rid of this and say on the

49
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.070
score item.

50
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.590
Item dot length.

51
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.820
Okay.

52
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.550
So this is going to give us a length, which is currently five.

53
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.130
Okay.

54
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.690
Hopefully you can see now we have five.
