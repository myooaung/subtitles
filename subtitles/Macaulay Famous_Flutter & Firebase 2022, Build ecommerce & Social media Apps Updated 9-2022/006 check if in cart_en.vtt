00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.900
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.370
Worker Now if the user as already had their this product to their cards.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.280
Then regular changes test to see in cots.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.640
Okay.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.100
In order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VSC code and then digital directory and

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.060
then digital page fi.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.530
Okay.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.710
Now we can then use control and bits and make this way.

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.100
Okay.

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.920
Now we have the heart to heart test.

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.250
Right.

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.640
Okay.

13
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.730
So what we're going to do is we're going to do some check.

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.150
Okay.

15
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.610
Now we're going to say by the scorecards provider.

16
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.750
That's.

17
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.310
Get a item that does contain.

18
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.980
Contains key are going to check based on their product ID.

19
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.650
So what we are simply saying is if the product has already been added to our cards.

20
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.310
Right.

21
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.830
Then we want to say in courts.

22
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.960
Okay.

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.209
Then else if it does not be.

24
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.610
Not that we just want to continue saying hearts of cards.

25
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.080
Okay?

26
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.000
No.

27
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.040
Then you're going to need to use control and this to save.

28
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.420
Okay.

29
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.820
Okay.

30
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.590
Double check.

31
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.440
You can see it is currently in our cards.

32
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.860
Okay.

33
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.960
Now to prove this so you can see it here.

34
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.560
Right.

35
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.880
Okay.

36
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.210
Okay.

37
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.160
Now, even if you click on this, the stick will hide the items of the cards.

38
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.470
Right.

39
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.040
So we're going to need to do is they're going to disable the button.

40
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.860
Right.

41
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.210
Okay.

42
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.080
Now we're going to go to where we are using.

43
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.360
Okay.

44
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.980
This is over here.

45
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.850
Okay.

46
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.670
We're going to do it the way we're going to see on the score cards.

47
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.690
Card provider darts gets card ten than darts contains.

48
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.289
That is if we have already had that it's so that's.

49
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.070
Okay.

50
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.240
He's going to get rid of this.

51
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.590
Okay.

52
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.490
The scorecards.

53
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.880
Provider.

54
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.700
That gets cut.

55
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.680
I said, then does.

56
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.540
Contains key.

57
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.920
Okay.

58
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.860
I think we need.

59
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.310
Okay.

60
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.790
So I'm going to check as well based on the products.

61
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.800
Heidi.

62
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.730
Okay.

63
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.600
Okay.

64
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.900
Now, if we already have it in our cards, they're going to disable the button by saying no.

65
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.590
Else.

66
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.530
Okay.

67
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.200
Now, nice control.

68
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.020
And that's the same.

69
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.780
Okay.

70
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.160
You can see it is currently visible.

71
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.660
You can click on it.

72
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.410
Okay, now I use this and that's all it starts.

73
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.450
Okay.

74
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.120
Just remove the active cards through our cards.

75
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.370
Right.

76
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.720
Okay.

77
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.520
Now.

78
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.330
Go check it out.

79
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.560
Okay.

80
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.720
It's going to take some time.

81
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.930
Okay, great.

82
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.480
Now click on this.

83
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.800
Okay.

84
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.170
I think we have not done that.

85
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.490
Okay.

86
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.990
Click on this.

87
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.650
Okay.

88
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.980
You can see it is currently not in our courts.

89
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.380
Right.

90
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.480
So the health passes.

91
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.020
Walk in.

92
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.910
Okay, now click on this.

93
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.310
Okay, great.

94
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.510
Right now, you can see we can no longer click on this again.

95
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.210
I can now go to go check.

96
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.440
Look, you can see the via.

97
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.430
Okay.

98
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.540
Now the other.

99
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.560
Okay, click on it.

100
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.050
Okay, great.

101
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.530
Okay.

102
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.810
Sounds good, right?

103
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.170
Okay.

104
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.690
Okay, guys.

105
