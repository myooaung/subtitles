Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.780
Now, what you're going to do in this lecture is whenever we delete the order, we are not just going

4
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.160
to delete it from the database, but as well we're going to need to update the UI.

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.810
So I set that current change.

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.200
Okay.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.980
So if we click on this and we get this deleted as well, we are going to need to update the UI to get

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.970
rid of this.

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.390
Okay.

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.830
Now to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VSC code and we are going to go to the provider

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.130
directory and then the order go Dutch and we are going to use this which you have seen before.

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.890
So over here all we just have to say sorry, okay?

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.520
All we just have to say is just use something which you've seen before.

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.500
Known as not to.

15
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.700
Notify.

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.300
No, Jeff, I just have to wait.

17
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.570
Okay.

18
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.950
Notify listener.

19
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.910
Okay.

20
00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.430
So what's this is going to do is it's going to look for the change we are making to this order that

21
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.110
says if we are deleting, these are not then is going to have dates UI based on the change we are making.

22
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.530
Okay.

23
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.580
So now what we can do is we can just go ahead and march.

24
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.400
We start this.

25
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.420
Or it starts in and.

26
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.670
All right, you start, then.

27
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.230
It's going to take some time and.

28
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.170
It's going to be fully restarted started okay you can see okay or to lower that and okay so what we

29
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.120
can now do is it's going to take us back to the home screen and then.

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.090
We can check for orders.

31
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.880
Okay.

32
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.470
My orders.

33
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.630
Okay.

34
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.260
You can see currently we have one.

35
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.660
And now let's try to delete this.

36
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.150
Okay.

37
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.690
I think I'm having some network issue.

38
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.870
That's why it's not deleted.

39
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.390
And twice.

40
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.760
If you go and check, you can see what else is going to get rid of this, admittedly.

41
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.360
Okay.

42
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.980
Right.

43
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.230
Okay.

44
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
So this is basically it's okay, guys.

45
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.169
See you in the next picture.
