00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.020
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.230
In this lecture, we're going to create a widget in order to play the uploaded video.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.150
Okay, not to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VR record.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.080
Now, you can see over here we are using a stock widget and the reason for this tag is we want the rest

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.560
widget.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.740
So be on top of the video widget and you can see we have not done it yet and we said we're going to

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.430
do it later.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.880
Okay.

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
So in this lecture we are going to implement this.

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.050
Okay.

12
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.160
Now to do this, we can then use control B to make this more like in and over this widgets that we we're

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.020
going to create a new PHI and we're going to call this video player.

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.190
I tend.

15
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.920
Then the section.

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.670
Dodge Dart.

17
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.630
Okay.

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.880
Now we are going to be using the in estates and in artesian estates.

19
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:08.320
We then need to use a stateful widget and as well we can call this video player I ten and now we need

20
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.630
to alight and then use control dots in that same part the material that that package.

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.590
Okay.

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.970
Now over here, we we're going to need to create a lead variable that's this.

23
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.390
We don't we don't want to initialize it at this time.

24
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.940
And it's going to be a type of video play the controller and we can't as we'll call this video player

25
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.280
controller, we can just call it controller.

26
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.600
Okay.

27
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.080
And now we can then use the init states.

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.240
Okay, we can get rid of this.

29
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.270
And.

30
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.660
We encore dad video player.

31
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.020
Video player controller Deron Williams is according to the video.

32
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.360
Okay, now we are initializing this video player.

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.550
Controller.

34
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.100
Controller, dot network.

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.270
Okay.

36
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.620
I'm just going to do this again.

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.180
Call the video player.

38
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.380
Then Dot network.

39
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.850
You can see this is a network.

40
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.520
Video.

41
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.100
You can see it has the ace2 tipi.

42
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.650
If you want to play a video from your your diet, you probably have the video in a folder.

43
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.730
This is going to be darts assets.

44
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.430
You can see how powerful the video player package is, but this is going to be Dot's network.

45
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.760
Okay.

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.400
Okay.

47
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.300
Now, what we can do is we can we're going to make this dynamic.

48
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.030
So whenever we call this video player item, we're gonna need to pass in the valley.

49
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.630
Now, this is going to get confused at this stage, but in the next picture, you're going to see this

50
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.090
fully.

51
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.530
Okay.

52
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.730
So what we can do is we're going to create a finer variable and there's going to be a type of string

53
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.280
and we can call this video URL.

54
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.030
You can see that's what we have over here.

55
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.010
Okay.

56
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.880
And we can.

57
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.170
This is equal to.

58
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.680
Sorry.

59
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.270
Okay.

60
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.460
We need to pass it on to the constructor does okay creates conceptual final fields you can see it automatically

61
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.940
passes the required if when there is a you don't have it you can just how this so yours okay I think

62
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.310
is because I'm using the 3.0.0.

63
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.900
I know that test is this top level variable we need to say.

64
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.500
Widgets.

65
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.430
We did then.

66
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.590
That's the URL.

67
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.190
Okay.

68
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.450
And now we can then say dots.

69
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.310
Dots.

70
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.150
Dot initialize.

71
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.470
I think in the end I think we have something like that.

72
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.110
ACC This is going to be to dot.

73
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.060
Because it is going to start in the.

74
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.980
Okay.

75
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.830
And we can see again dots.

76
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.700
Then we want something to happen and we can just take this on this line and this way.

77
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
And what's happened is we're going to call the video.

78
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:18.920
Controller.

79
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.200
Then we want to play the video.

80
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.250
And as well, they're going to call the video controller.

81
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.230
And that said volume.

82
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.710
And isn't to say one k.

83
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.550
Okay.

84
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.830
That's what we can call the video controller.

85
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.370
Video controller.

86
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.780
And then she said, look, in the true we're not going to do this because we just want the video to

87
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.060
play once and for right.

88
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.380
We're going to continue playing it all the time again.

89
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.910
Okay.

90
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.810
Now what we have to do now.

91
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.180
Yes.

92
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.850
We're just going to go with the container and.

93
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.120
We also need to dispose this, right, so we can have the dispose.

94
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.150
And you really know what this does.

95
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.120
Remember whenever I start playing the video, when the video isn't in the state, right.

96
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.610
We are basically using the interstate.

97
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.220
And the reasons for this in this state is we want this trigger or this amendment will visit the video

98
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.720
screen page.

99
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.050
Right.

100
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.530
Okay.

101
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.280
And even if we go from this screen, the video is still going to continue playing.

102
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.840
So that's why we need to call this video controller.

103
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.660
Video controller and does this pose okay?

104
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.600
We also need to do this for the second mission.

105
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.560
And.

106
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.650
The noise.

107
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.870
You're not going to see this because you know, you're not going to see diluted narratives in the future

108
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.490
when you're not in the screen.

109
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.390
What's behind this scene is still rotating.

110
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.850
So we need to also dispose this.

111
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.020
You're going to know if it was a video.

112
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.830
Okay.

113
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.950
So called the dispose as well.

114
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.200
This post.

115
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.420
Okay, great.

116
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.380
Okay.

117
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.990
And now we can continue on for Andy.

118
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.100
Okay.

119
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.250
So we can see this is the design for each video.

120
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.660
Okay.

121
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:32.690
Now, all we can do is we can give it to this container and we want the video to take the full size

122
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.920
of our screen.

123
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.930
So to do that, what we need to do is to say.

124
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.840
Media query out of context, the size, the wheat.

125
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.420
So this is going to give us the full weight of our screen and as well we also need the height.

126
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.960
So we also an individual to take the full height of our screen, lots of contests.

127
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.760
The size.

128
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.170
That's height.

129
00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.400
Sorry.

130
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.370
Not as good not to host code.

131
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.660
Okay.

132
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.330
And now we can all the decoration.

133
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:16.260
So you just give this video a black background so you can see color and colors, darts, black.

134
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.440
And now we can then have the child.

135
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.710
The child is going to be video player because we definitely want to play the video video player.

136
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.330
And now we need to call the video, control our video.

137
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.200
Okay.

138
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.630
This is basically it.

139
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:35.980
Okay.

140
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.010
Now, we can use this to make sure this fire safe.

141
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.490
Okay.

142
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.250
Now, all we have to do now is to go back to the video screen and overlay.

143
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.400
Now this is the first we get, so the rest we get are going to be what's on top of this.

144
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.460
And now we can then caught that video.

145
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.550
Video player, I-10.

146
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.790
Now you can see it wants this to pass the value to this.

147
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:08.050
Now, in this lecture, what are you going to need to do is we are going to we are referred to fridge

148
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.650
the over here you can see we have ready fetch.

149
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.630
Sorry.

150
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.680
Nobody.

151
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.110
We already fetch the videos, right?

152
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.490
So in this lecture, we are going to be able to display them a case.

153
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:29.930
And in this lecture we are going to pass the value to this video URL by for all we can do is additional

154
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.230
color and what we can also do.

155
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.789
Okay, we can just command this off.

156
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.260
For now.

157
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.659
Okay.

158
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.020
Okay.

159
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.320
So when you started this, you're not going to get an error.

160
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.440
So you can make sure you kind of commit this out for now and.

161
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.150
Overall, what you can observe is over.

162
00:08:51.280 --> 00:09:00.130
This video pretend you can just see it can it can be no wish Ms. would already need to pass a value

163
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.770
and you can then get rid of.

164
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.610
They required.

165
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.020
I think we need.

166
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.270
Okay.

167
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.690
This is going to be okay.

168
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:21.790
We did we get we get we get that video URL and we need to add this.

169
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:22.690
Okay.

170
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.640
Well, we're just going to go back to what it was.

171
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:29.960
Okay.

172
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.400
Okay.

173
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.280
Video.

174
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.250
Video player controller.

175
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:36.710
Okay.

176
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:37.990
Okay.

177
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.500
So we went back to what it was and over here what we simply did was he just committed towns.

178
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:52.490
