00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.710
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.280
Now, you can see we have just two products, but we are only able to display one products.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.810
So in this lecture, we are going to be able to display all products we have over here.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.780
Okay.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.150
But before then.

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.650
In the previous lecture.

8
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.400
We created a fire code for that I-10.

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.380
Then we designed.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.190
How each product is going to look like.

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.000
Right.

12
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.420
Okay.

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.490
So now what you're going to do next is over this widget, you're going to create a new FY.

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.330
And we're just going to call this.

15
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.320
All.

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.810
Or this product.

17
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.010
Then there's section two dot.

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.370
And we can use this widget.

19
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.930
The lest we get.

20
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.910
As well.

21
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.170
We are going to call this all.

22
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.950
Products.

23
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.390
Right.

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.130
And we can also use controlled B to make this right in over a year or trillion dollars in stimulus.

25
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.300
You out that that package.

26
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.250
Okay great.

27
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.660
Now, first of all, we are just going to have a chart, then a color in case we want some more additional

28
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.680
property that is going to be displayed vertically.

29
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.240
Okay.

30
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.330
So now over this column, we can then have a chart as well.

31
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.130
So it should read.

32
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.120
Then the first child is going to be a container.

33
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.820
Okay.

34
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.320
A container then is container can have a height of 280.

35
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.300
Okay, then the child.

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.880
Is going to be sold in on us.

37
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.360
Leased.

38
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.820
Leased.

39
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.610
The view.

40
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.500
The separated.

41
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.870
Okay.

42
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.390
Now you can see we have all this the item before the.

43
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.950
The spirit of you there and I think counts.

44
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.520
No, like I said, we are going to display all the products we have and the models that is this close

45
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.630
for us right now to describe us as to all these products.

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.700
We need to have access to this.

47
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.870
Variable could generate close right or this function away called generate calls.

48
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.280
Okay.

49
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.990
So that to do that, you're going to need to go back to the whole products in contract.

50
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.190
Okay.

51
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.300
Now we can create a find available and we can call this.

52
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.260
We will close.

53
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.390
Least there's going to be courts, too.

54
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.110
That's closed class first.

55
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.230
We can't just assess that generic clothes with that of innocence to the class because it's more like

56
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.060
a father to this.

57
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.970
Okay, so there it goes.

58
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.760
Now we can.

59
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.960
Then how the semicolon.

60
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.350
Okay.

61
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.210
Now for the item that is going to start with the item code for the item code is simply is many products

62
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.900
we have.

63
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.650
Right.

64
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.610
We can statically type six, but we are going to give the high ten based on the clothes we have.

65
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.920
So to do that, they're going to need to call that a variable we created that is just horrible.

66
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.300
They call closed this.

67
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.220
So we're going to need to say.

68
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.110
Okay.

69
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.360
Close this.

70
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.390
Close.

71
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.150
It's a record.

72
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.180
It's close.

73
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.510
So.

74
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.000
Close.

75
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.630
Least.

76
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.870
Okay, then let's.

77
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.330
Okay.

78
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.370
Now, for this effort together.

79
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.840
It simply means the space we need between each product.

80
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.310
So over here.

81
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.850
They're going to get rid of this, then they're going to give the apprentices the first value is going

82
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.240
to be not.

83
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.790
So I just want to say on this call then comma.

84
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.000
Right, then we.

85
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.640
I've only used an arrow function.

86
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.810
So I think so.

87
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.459
We need to as intense as well.

88
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.800
Then we can then use in our function.

89
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.230
Okay.

90
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.320
Now, I'm going to give you this first.

91
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm going to give you the space vertically so it not vertically.

92
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.710
Vertically has to do with top to bottom.

93
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.790
You're going to be given the space horizontally so you can't see.

94
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.590
Size works.

95
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.100
Okay.

96
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.030
But we don't tell you how to do it right to left or right or right or left.

97
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.500
So you can give it of.

98
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.900
Ten.

99
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.860
Okay.

100
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.600
Now for the item.

101
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.570
Fuda is simply amazed how we are going to display each product or how we are going to display the products.

102
00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.370
Okay, so now what you're going to do now is to pass the parentheses first, right?

103
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.450
Able to pass and contest.

104
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.210
An intense debate cannot a function.

105
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.280
This, then this is just going to be that.

106
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.150
Products item we designed.

107
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.930
Okay.

108
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.020
So there's going to be.

109
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.450
Products.

110
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.830
A tape recorders for us.

111
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.230
We can go straight, namely to product item.

112
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.530
Okay.

113
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.330
Recorded product item.

114
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.600
Right.

115
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.900
Okay.

116
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.690
They can see this fix evaluates.

117
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.010
It's going to be that close.

118
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.270
This close.

119
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.380
This.

120
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.580
Then they wouldn't need to pass in dance to assess each single product we have in the clothes and what

121
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.380
else we can do in hard atrial coma and use contract initiative.

122
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.640
Okay.

123
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.090
And go check what you did.

124
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.550
Okay.

125
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.230
No hero.

126
00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.600
Okay.

127
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.540
We need to add it to the home screen.

128
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.860
Right.

129
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.030
So we're just going to get rid of this clothes item since this for those item.

130
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.450
Sorry.

131
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.090
Right.

132
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.770
Okay.

133
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.390
Get rid of this, then.

134
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.910
All.

135
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.220
Products.

136
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.260
Okay, great.

137
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.340
I'll go check it out.

138
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.550
Okay.

139
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.790
I think it's taking longer than expected.

140
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.190
Okay.

141
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.330
Okay.

142
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.090
Go check it out.

143
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.740
Okay.

144
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.660
You can see it now.

145
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.350
Well, we can only screw the effort.

146
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.320
It's going to take the vertical shift.

147
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.270
That's from top to bottom.

148
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.140
Right.

149
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.490
Okay.

150
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.670
So now what they're going to do, they're going to go back to the whole trigger.

151
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.460
Well, that's.

152
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.640
Like I said before, the view is going to take the vertical ship that is more like the column shape,

153
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.970
right?

154
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.790
So now what we are going to do is use the roof form.

155
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.010
And that was why we gave the space.

156
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.340
Of horizontally that is we tried.

157
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.870
Okay so there it is.

158
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.970
View has a property known as.

159
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.850
Sorry.

160
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.880
Known as cruel direction.

161
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.530
So we have to see this.

162
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.720
US is not horizontal.

163
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.110
Okay, great.

164
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.060
So we simply want to do a role for that is from left to right.

165
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.930
Okay, great.

166
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.040
They can sit.

167
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.990
They can see the space over here.

168
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.410
So does this does the work of this separate orbiter?

169
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.400
Does it do.

170
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.800
It's the space we need between each products.

171
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.250
Therefore, there's going be some space.

172
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.470
Okay.

173
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.750
Let's just try to reduce this to five.

174
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.080
Okay.

175
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.470
You can say it's what you thought.

176
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.340
Even if we did this a zero, there's still going to be some space.

177
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.080
Okay, we're just going to go with ten.

178
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.060
Okay.

179
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.260
Oh, it's okay.

180
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.070
Okay.

181
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.610
Great.

182
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.080
Right.

183
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.500
Okay.

184
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.340
Sounds good.

185
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.860
But now we have one product.

186
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.610
Okay.

187

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.040
Then just copy this.

189
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.570

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:23.870
