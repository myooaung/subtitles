00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.860
Walker, in this lecture regularly used the list view the view there.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.880
And the reason for this is uses are going to be what a hard multiple item so they are cuts and we are

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.070
going to display this item over here.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.730
Okay so now you can see the list view duder as a way to look over each cut item.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.660
Okay, not to do this, I don't need to go back to the code and then the cut screen and then we can

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.140
use cut.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.700
You agree to make this wide?

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.130
