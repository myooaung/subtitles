00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.780
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.820
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.020
In this lecture, we are going to install the Swiper package.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:17.170
And the reason for this is because whenever a user clicks on any of the products, that product might

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.410
have multiple images.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.130
Right?

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.550
And what we want to be able to do is to be able to slide or swipe the image this way.

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.670
So to do that, we have to store this package in order to make our life much more easier.

9
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.460
To do this, you have to head up to the pop dot dev.

10
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.370
And over here we are going to search for swiper.

11
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.110
And.

12
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.160
Okay.

13
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.540
And.

14
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.760
We're not going to be using this.

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.980
You can say this is depreciated.

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.370
So we have to scroll down to this where we have the flutter on the score.

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.220
Swiper on the score.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.630
No, on the score.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.540
Safety.

20
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.250
Okay, click on this.

21
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.990
And now we have to copy this code and then head back to our visa code and then the post back dot yaml

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.930
file.

23
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.410
And you can secretly hire vets already.

24
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.210
So what you have to do is to paste it and use control and save or get the package over here.

25
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.200
And most of the time, you just have to restart your voice code.

26
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.220
Okay.

27
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.950
So now we have to head back to the product detail screen, right?

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.290
Product detail.

29
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.060
And what we can then do is to use constraint based, make this wide and instead of having the centre

30
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.040
widget, we can then get rid of it.

31
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.820
Okay.

32
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.510
Now all of our widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

33
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.480
That is from top to bottom.

34
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.060
So for this purpose, we are going to be using a column widget.

35
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.430
And as we know, a column can take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed vertically.

36
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:31.000
So it adds this children property and the first child is going to be a size box.

37
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.700
And the reason for the size box is because we basically want to give our image a height.

38
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.150
So over here we can use a size.

39
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.480
Size.

40
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.630
Sized.

41
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.320
Box and hide.

42
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.070
And this sort of person, a static figure over here.

43
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.850
We can make this responsive.

44
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.300
And to do that, we have to use the media, media query and dot contest.

45
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:15.100
And then we have to say dot size and dot height and we're just going to change this by 0.45.

46
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.920
He said.

47
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.060
And then we can have the chart, and the chart is going to be the Swiper package we just saw.

48
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.290
If for any reason you can't key into this, you just have to restart your code.

49
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.660
Okay.

50
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.130
Now the swipe bar has a property known as Page.

51
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.630
Sorry, pagination.

52
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.010
And the pagination is basically referring to how we are going to be able to slide or swipe that image.

53
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.750
And we want this way.

54
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.080
Right?

55
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.100
So what we can then say is swiper.

56
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.230
Swiper.

57
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.510
Pagination.

58
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.680
And the swipe our pagination is going to take something known as beta.

59
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:06.640
You can see it as well has some other property like key margin and alignment, but we're just going

60
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.060
to have just this beta and for the beta is also going to be a swipe bar.

61
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.310
Swipe her.

62
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.089
So I pagination and we can say dot dots.

63
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.120
What these dots will do is if we have three images, he's just going to have three dots over here and

64
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.070
we are going to be able to scroll this way.

65
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.730
Right.

66
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.890
Okay.

67
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.350
You're just going to see this.

68
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.320
But we are not going to go with this dot dots, but we have to go with this dot fraction.

69
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.390
So we are going to have numbers.

70
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.870
Okay.

71
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.890
And you're going to see this shortly.

72
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:54.250
And also the soy bar has a property known as item builder.

73
00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.600
And the view there will always take in the context and as well the indents.

74
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.220
And of course, you can specify the type of context and also you can specify the type of index.

75
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.740
Nevada.

76
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.520
We need this and we basically would want to return an image the network.

77
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.030
Look for.

78
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.260
Now, what you just have to do is to head back to our browser.

79
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.520
And over here you can search for.

80
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.840
Sorry.

81
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.000
I think already.

82
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.480
Over a year, you can search for products, images.

83
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:45.970
And what I simply just do was to open one of these, I think this in a new tab or sorry, I can't find

84
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.660
it anymore.

85
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.420
All you just have to do is to open this via or maybe you just have to click on this.

86
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.250
Okay.

87
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.300
You can see the wire.

88
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:03.100
And I just have to maybe go with this for now and copy.

89
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.140
Image.

90
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.760
Address and box.

91
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.870
Office code.

92
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.860
And.

93
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.000
PS this.

94
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.030
Okay.

95
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.620
And why we need.

96
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.820
A cynical.

97
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.640
And you can see we still have this error.

98
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.960
And the reason for this error is because there is a property which we have not passed, which is known

99
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.180
as item counts for the item count.

100
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.850
We can just say we have just one image for now.

101
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.020
Okay, now use control.

102
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.500
And has to save.

103
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.730
Contrariness.

104
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.730
Okay.

105
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.130
And let's go check it out.

106
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.470
Okay.

107
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.590
No image.

108
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.620
Okay, Cisco, you can see we have this image.

109
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.590
You can see we have this one over here.

110
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.760
And that is because we are saying swipe our pagination, those fraction.

111
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.200
If not, we could also say dot, dot.

112
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.170
Okay.

113
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.120
Okay.

114
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.520
And is control necessary?

115
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.000
And this is of this you can see just one dot.

116
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.140
You can see we can then swipe this way, Cisco.

117
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.680
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
