00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.190
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.920
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.790
In this lecture region display the current logged in user display name and this user name filled well

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.220
before then in order to have access to the values the user is going to type in, are going to visit

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.680
something known as test at that same controller.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.250
Okay.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.560
Now you're going to go to the top.

8
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.000
Over a year, we're going to create a slate variable.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.310
You're going to see why we are creating a large variable that we want to call this medicine.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.000
I'd.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.190
They're going to set it to nothing for now that we can specify the type that it sees it tests.

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.930
It's in controller.

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.670
As well.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.260
They're going to create for the.

15
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.860
Name.

16
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.890
So this is going to be late as well.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.770
There's going to be name.

18
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.420
Controller is going to call this controller.

19
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.380
Meeting ID.

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.180
Controller.

21
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.380
Okay.

22
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.820
The courts are not in there.

23
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.480
We can then specify the type.

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920
It is a type of test editing controller.

25
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.070
Okay.

26
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.230
Now, what are going to do now is.

27
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.780
They're going to bind this two variables to the two test fields.

28
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.210
So over this is the first one we tend to test field.

29
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.920
You're going to see a controller.

30
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.870
The controller is going to be the meeting ID controller.

31
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.250
Then.

32
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.560
For the name.

33
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.960
Is going to be comptroller is going to be name comptroller.

34
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.820
So by doing this, we're going to be able to list in for the values.

35
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.930
Okay.

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.820
Now, what you're going to do next is we're going to pass the user name to the user display name to

37
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.210
the.

38
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.580
User name field.

39
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.000
Okay.

40
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.610
Now to do this for a lot of reasons not to initiate in states that are using this state.

41
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.389
You're going to need to convert our stateless widgets instead for widgets.

42
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.310
So these control.

43
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.830
Control and dots converts to stateful widgets.

44
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.140
Okay, great.

45
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.760
Now we're recognizing this data and you're going to see where we are in the late.

46
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.780
Okay.

47
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.740
In this state.

48
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.990
Okay, now we are going to initialize this medicine.

49
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.930
The controller normally would see.

50
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.490
Is equipped to test it.

51
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.990
The controller tested the controller.

52
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.340
Right.

53
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.730
But we are not doing this.

54
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.630
Right.

55
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.350
So now what we're going to do, we're going to do it inside this in this state.

56
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.810
The reason for this in this state is we want to fire what you call the test.

57
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.710
It is the controller.

58
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.600
Any time this.

59
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.050
Video calls loads.

60
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.300
So that's the reason for the in this state.

61
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.020
So what we're going to do now is really say meeting idea controller.

62
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.980
That is not very well.

63
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.660
It's going to be quite a test.

64
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.340
It's a controller.

65
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.210
So we all are using the test to test tested.

66
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.080
It's a controller.

67
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.190
Went over to the video screen page loads.

68
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.820
Okay.

69
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.320
So this is going to be name.

70
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.190
Controller.

71
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.610
That is going to be equal to.

72
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.260
Just that the two controllers are.

73
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.570
Right.

74
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.950
Okay.

75
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.660
Just add the 10th controller.

76
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.190
Controller.

77
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.200
Just so it's in.

78
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.110
Controller.

79
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.470
Okay.

80
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.310
I got it now.

81
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.870
Okay, great.

82
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.520
Now, like I said, what you're going to do next status.

83
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.820
Retina display the correct.

84
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.420
Logged and user displayed them over you.

85
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.740
Not to do that.

86
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.750
Remembering our old controller.

87
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.400
Our arts.

88
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.590
Okay.

89
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.230
I think controllers then the odds of this Coca-Cola we have available via quad user wish.

90
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.080
Has the wish has the values of all our users that is that is displayed in the email and everything attached

91
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.380
to that.

92
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.230
It logs that user, it is available and is variable.

93
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.110
And I see no we can't access this variable which out of it assess so this class.

94
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.950
Right, so before we have access to this, we need to have access to this for us.

95
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.400
Okay.

96
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.550
So now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to the.

97
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.730
Videos all screen and be.

98
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.980
Now we're gonna work on the need to initialize that.

99
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.630
So we're going to see finer.

100
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.130
Right.

101
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.490
FINA is going to be.

102
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.270
Odds Control.

103
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.810
All right.

104
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.640
It's going to be on it's called arts control.

105
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.580
It's going to be a quality test.

106
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.210
So.

107
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.080
What controller?

108
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.920
You already know.

109
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.100
What this does is the type of the suit we are saying this is the type of this is the controller is the

110
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.060
type of that class.

111
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.160
Well, most of the time you don't really need is that you don't really need to specify the type.

112
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.110
You can just go with that.

113
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.460
Okay.

114
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.850
Now you can have assets that are available in that class, right?

115
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.490
So now this is a controller.

116
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.380
It has something that we have not seen before.

117
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.540
It's as it says.

118
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.960
So you can actually pass in a default test or via.

119
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.580
And it's going to be a valuable day.

120
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.310
Okay, I think.

121
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.810
Okay.

122
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.660
Okay.

123
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.410
They can see it.

124
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.000
It's available, right?

125
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.390
Okay.

126
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.980
So you can assure the.

127
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.880
As of today.

128
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.010
So I will be doing the passenger for the mitten controller for now.

129
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.170
So nevertheless, it's for the.

130
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.750
For the name controller.

131
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.160
So you're going to see test.

132
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.430
This is going to be the user name, right?

133
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.900
So they're going to say, oh, the score or it's controller.

134
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.830
Standard.

135
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.180
User standards this filename.

136
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.830
Okay.

137
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.190
Great.

138
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.750
Nice catch on this disease and go check it out.

139
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.620
Now we actually got an error.

140
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:36.460
I don't really know if you can see because it's good to work on the tannoy is not displaying the display.

141
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.520
Okay.

142
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.510
The book also.

143
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.160
Okay.

144
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.730
We can actually see this.

145
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:50.300
Well, the reason why is not as plain or probably you got the error or you might see the error there

146
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.220
is in this all display is because you are using in late or via it's a variable for this test.

147
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:04.190
It is a controller and for the now the display name is currently not available because we are using

148
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.570
the word delete.

149
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.890
So enough to make it a variable, we need to refresh it.

150
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.780
Refresh everything.

151
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.470
And then it's going to be available for nice and available, right?

152
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.460
The reason for the lead as well is so we are able to call this test.

153
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:31.630
It is the controller letter that is we sort of we we had to have say.

154
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.560
Test is equal to test it to control our rights.

155
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.780
Well, we are just saying we don't want to use that now.

156
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.410
So we are going to use it later on.

157
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.670
Now over here and then this database.

158
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.340
That's right.

159
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.960
Okay.

160
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.290
And for the United States, they're basically saying.

161
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.410
Once the video screen loads, then everything is going to run.

162
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.120
Okay, hopefully in this bag.

163
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.360
But we don't understand as far as the process goes, you going to get everything?

164
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.270
Lights works.

165
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.460
Okay now with the click on, join within.

166
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.590
Okay, great.

167
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:15.760
You can see the corridor logged in user display name or via write words.

168
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.970
So remember in the future I just have to look for a way to explain data to you.

169
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.990
So you understand.

170
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.470
Okay.

171
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.790
Okay, guys.

172
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.900
Seen in this lecture.
