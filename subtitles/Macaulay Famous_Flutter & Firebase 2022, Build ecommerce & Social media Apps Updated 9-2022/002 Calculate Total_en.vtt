00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:08.400
Our guys walk in this lecture, we are fully going to start building the permit screen and it's going

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.300
to look very similar to that of the place or the screen because in the future we are going to be able

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.140
to have access to the customer's data.

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.630
Okay.

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.860
So what we can do is we can just highlight this entire screen and use controller and see to copy and

6
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.380
back to the payment screen.

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.590
And we can highlight this and get rid of it and use controller and see to.

8
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.820
Sorry, controller.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.420
Sorry.

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.950
I'm just going to copy this again.

11
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.060
Okay, Control, see?

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.940
And Contrave.

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.100
Contrave is based.

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.120
Okay.

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.940
Sorry.

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.770
What is wrong?

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.560
He's going to do this.

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.990
Click on this.

19
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.360
Yeah.

20
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.130
Just going to copy this again.

21
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.690
A light use control and see.

22
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.850
And here's this.

23
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.490
And now we have to rename it back to the premiere screen.

24
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.280
We can just allow it and.

25
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.070
Payment then screen.

26
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.790
Okay.

27
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.380
Okay.

28
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.330
It's not defined and we can get rid of this unused import.

29
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.710
Okay.

30
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.240
I think we're missing something.

31
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.910
Okay.

32
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.280
Although they.

33
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.890
Can trend be this as well?

34
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.970
Use control.

35
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.120
And that's the save now.

36
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.400
And you should see it over.

37
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.480
Via.

38
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.520
And now we really do not need all this because this is going to be the payment screen.

39
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.810
So what we can do is we can get rid of this test widget.

40
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.450
Okay.

41
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.810
And for now, we can get rid of this cross axis alignment or start.

42
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.490
And also we do not need any Cosima.

43
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.180
We can get rid of this.

44
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.910
It ends over.

45
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.820
Yeah.

46
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.160
Okay.

47
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.440
Great.

48
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.400
And also we can.

49
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.870
Okay.

50
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.320
Get rid of this chart for now.

51
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.960
Okay.

52
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.700
This country needs to save.

53
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.620
And go check it out.

54
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.270
OC OC since school.

55
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.820
Now it's in the row.

56
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.370
So within the column we can have a row.

57
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.290
And the reason for this road is because we want to have a test over here which is going to say Twitter.

58
00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.800
And over here we want to have the products Twitter price.

59
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.680
To do this, we have to use a row in order to display widgets horizontally.

60
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.440
And the first chart is going to be a test and it's going to say Twitter.

61
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.660
Okay.

62
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.470
This country needs to save.

63
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.680
And you should say it's over.

64
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.620
All right.

65
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.350
Okay.

66
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.930
And we can start this test.

67
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.260
Okay.

68
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.220
We can increase the font size to maybe 20.

69
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.230
And forthwith.

70
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.980
It's going to be fun with.

71
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.040
Fault with the boat.

72
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.660
Okay.

73
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.540
Good.

74
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.340
And you should see it over.

75
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.980
Okay.

76
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.540
Yeah.

77
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.610
Okay, great.

78
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.510
And what we can then do is have your trainer and we can have another test, which is going to be for

79
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.790
the total price.

80
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.170
And what we can also just do is, rather than having it here.

81
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.480
Right, right.

82
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.340
And say card provider or provider of contest and so on, we can just create a variable to do that.

83
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.750
And we are going to do this with ten.

84
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.279
Within.

85
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.120
Okay.

86
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.890
We tend to dispute.

87
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.560
And the reason is because we want to have access to this contest.

88
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.770
I'm just going to create this over here to show you.

89
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.580
We can create a variable called there's going to be a type of double.

90
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.180
Right.

91
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.190
And you can call this to.

92
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.370
Total prize.

93
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.970
Right.

94
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.980
And you can then say is going to be equal to.

95
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.000
It's going to be equal to what?

96
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.140
It's going to be equal to maybe provider.

97
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.440
Provider.

98
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.180
Dot of contest.

99
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.860
You can see that contest has a red on the line.

100
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.990
And we can also say we want to have access to the cards provider.

101
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.630
And within the card provider class, we have a function or a getter known as total prize.

102
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.970
Okay, great.

103
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.670
Now you can see we have this contest error and you can see currently it is undefined.

104
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.780
So what we can then do is we can get rid of it over from here, get rid of it from this path and we

105
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.300
can paste it within the widget beauty contest in order for us to have access to that contest.

106
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.270
You can see currently we have no errors.

107
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.880
Okay.

108
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.970
Okay.

109
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.510
And alright.

110
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.180
We can just call that verbal code through there.

111
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.300
tOe to toe the price.

112
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.330
And it is a double.

113
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.070
So we have to say the two string as fixed and this is going to be true.

114
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.760
Okay, great.

115
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.850
And you should say it's over.

116
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.150
Over here.

117
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.820
Okay.

118
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.880
And we can just copy this tie.

119
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.250
Copy this.

120
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.730
And --.

121
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.270
Okay.

122
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.910
Great.

123
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.950
And what we can also do is within the law, we can then say main us elements, main us.

124
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.730
I mean, assess alignment.

125
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.150
I mean as this element of space between.

126
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.640
These control and save energy, say over a.

127
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.000
Okay.

128
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.780
Okay.

129
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.050
And lastly, we can also have a caller for this.

130
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.050
This is going to be colors that sign.

131
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.980
Okay.

132
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.460
Cisco.

133
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.920
Cisco.

134
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.500
Cisco.

135
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.660
And now.

136
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.090
Outside the row within the column, we can then have a divider.

137
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.980
Diverter.

138
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:15.810
We can give this a thickness of maybe two and color of the colors that gray.

139
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.270
Okay.

140
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.200
Lose control and save.

141
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.530
Okay.

142
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.830
Okay.

143
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.000
Sounds cool and over yet we can have the sorta.

144
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.900
Why are we going?

145
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.240
Well, we can just call this.

146
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.550
Okay to tap paid.

147
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.190
Okay.

148
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:43.060
So what we can just do is we can copy from this sorry, this row.

149
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.160
In order for us to have another row copy from this.

150
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.050
And.

151
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.020
Hi digital camera.

152
00:07:53.830 --> 00:08:00.730
And we can then pace this and we can change this from ta ta ta ta ta paid.

153
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.760
Okay.

154
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.490
Okay.

155
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.980
She said, all right now.

156
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.280
Okay to tap it.

157
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.030
And what we can do is the switch.

158
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.730
So.

159
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.820
Sorry.

160
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.230
Sorry.

161
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.890
So.

162
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.150
Let's not do this.

163
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.630
Okay.

164
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.190
This is the first row for the Twitter.

165
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.580
And right over here, we can then piece this.

166
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.360
And then renamed this to top paid.

167
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.380
Okay.

168
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.380
So I paid.

169
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.760
Sorry.

170
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.909
Okay.

171
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.790
And let's go check it out.

172
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.360
Okay.

173
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.940
So it's a page.

174
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.070
And what we can do is we can have maybe a shipping fee of $10 to the tutor.

175
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.640
I'm just going to wait.

176
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.340
Sorry for that.

177
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.900
We can add a shipping fee of maybe $10 to this.

178
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.530
$50 to do that.

179
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.250
Okay.

180
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.750
Think girl stock.

181
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.440
Okay.

182
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.890
Sorry.

183
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.430
Okay.

184
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.830
Alright, we can create another variable is going to be a type of double.

185
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.120
Double and you can call this.

186
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.340
So it's our page and we have to get access to this, first of all.

187
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.080
Get us to this and we want to say plus maybe ten.

188
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.710
Okay.

189
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.770
You know, and.

190
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.790
Instead of this.

191
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.340
Okay.

192
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.950
We have to then say.

193
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.330
Get rid of this to the price.

194
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.210
And this is going to be a paid.

195
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.770
Okay.

196
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.880
So.

197
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.930
And hopefully we have no spelling mistake.

198
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.740
Okay.

199
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.530
Use control and s to save.

200
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.310
And you should see.

201
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:08.650
Okay.

202
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.480
60.

203
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.020
Okay.

204
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.400
Okay for this disappeared.

205
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.900
We can just give a caller.

206
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.520
This is going to be callers.

207
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.760
That may be great.

208
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.310
So make it a bit faded.

209
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.740
Okay.

210
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.500
Go check it out.

211
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.090
And I is going to look.

212
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.370
Okay.

213
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.620
And also, we can make things clear for the user.

214
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.880
We can just reduce this to maybe ten.

215
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.310
I think it's way too big.

216
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.860
Ten and.

217
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.760
So there should be a thin.

218
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.820
Okay.

219
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.770
We can make it a bit clear to the user to tell the user what is paying that additional $10 for.

220
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.900
So that's why the here again, we can have another rule.

221
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.900
Sorry, we can just copy this row.

222
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.930
Copy this rule.

223
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.950
Sorry.

224
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.460
Copy this rule and the terms of.

225
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.310
And we are going to pass this and we can.

226
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.410
Cordis will be shipping.

227
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.520
Shipping costs.

228
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.850
And manually for now, we can just get rid of this.

229
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.470
And manually say ten.

230
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.530
Or you can just create a web to store that as well.

231
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.780
Let's go check this.

232
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.490
Okay.

233
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.740
And you can see the height is no longer able to contain the shipping cost.

234
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:57.440
So what we can do, as you can see, we have this height of 90, we can say 130 to expand, expanded.

235
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.420
Okay.

236
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.010
Okay.

237
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.330
I think it's way too much.

238
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.990
We can just go for maybe 120.

239
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.300
Why don't we see?

240
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.820
Okay.

241
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.620
Okay.

242
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.410
So cool.

243
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:28.410
And also maybe what we could also do is within the column we can say main US element, main US elements.

244
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.720
I mean NASA's alignment of space invalid to have equal space distributed.

245
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.060
Okay.

246
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.380
Okay.

247
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.450
Okay.

248
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.090
I think this a okay.

249
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:54.000
And lastly, for now, what we can also do, we can display the total price the user is going to pay

250
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.190
over over here.

251
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.210
Okay.

252
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.270
So while we can't just tell you, we can use a dollar sign in order to concatenate a variable and a

253
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:05.990
string.

254
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.030
And this is going to be totally paid.

255
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.670
So to.

256
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.750
Paid.

257
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.570
Okay.

258
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.450
And also, we have to convert this.

259
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.180
Okay.

260
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.830
I think let's go check it out to see if we are going to have any error, first of all.

261
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.590
And we are expecting this over.

262
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.650
Okay.

263
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.320
Great.

264
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.960
And maybe we could say that.

265
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.900
Dot, dot a string.

266
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.340
Well, maybe.

267
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.540
Why that?

268
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:39.410
Okay.

269
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.320
We cannot have access to that.

270
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.660
The trophies are string and see how it's going to look, if it's going to work as expected.

271
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.620
This way.

272
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.450
Okay.

273
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:53.830
Okay.

274
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:54.370
Great.

275
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.000
Okay.

276
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.740
Cisco.

277
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.530
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
