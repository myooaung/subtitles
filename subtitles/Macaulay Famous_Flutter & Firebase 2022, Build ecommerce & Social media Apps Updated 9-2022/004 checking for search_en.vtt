00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.070
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.230
Now, all we're going to need to do in this lecture is if a user has no sets for new projects.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.360
We then want to have a test of overlay year, which is going to say search for progress.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.750
Okay.

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.530
Now, in order to do this, we need to go back to our VSC code and then this screen, and now we can

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.420
use contra and beats to make this slide.

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.870
Okay.

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
Now you can see that we have a variable card search.

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.910
This is a type of the paradox model.

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.270
Okay.

12
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.710
Now, we don't really need this.

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.820
Okay.

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.400
And in order to have access to this function we have in the products.

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.040
Okay.

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.550
Now let's have access to this search query.

17
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.600
We need to first have access to this class.

18
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.980
And that is what we are basically doing over.

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.670
Yeah.

20
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.220
You can see we created a variable to store the products provider.

21
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.020
And over here, we are having this test date in order to automatically update the UI.

22
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.380
Okay.

23
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.110
You can see with the top G.

24
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.610
You can see this gets automatically updated, the UCC and so on.

25
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.060
Okay.

26
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.900
Great.

27
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.280
Okay.

28
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.610
Now, what we need to do now is to check if the.

29
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.550
Search is empty or not.

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.900
What we can just do.

31
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.010
You can go back to.

32
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.220
Under the screen.

33
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.130
Okay.

34
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.380
I'm going to go back to.

35
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.770
Okay.

36
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.210
Okay.

37
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.880
Now, we don't have any products, okay?

38
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.830
Now, all we need to do is over here.

39
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.980
We can check.

40
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.010
We can call that on this car search.

41
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.620
Search list.

42
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
And say that is empty.

43
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.130
It is empty.

44
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.500
We didn't want to have a sense of wages and a child, which is going to be a test we did and it just

45
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.430
bonuses such.

46
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.530
For.

47
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.290
Her dad's okay over yet?

48
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.750
We need to had this okay for the house.

49
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.010
Okay.

50
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.950
Now we can use contra and se to save.

51
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.880
And you can only see search products.

52
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.350
Okay.

53
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.220
Search for products.

54
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.610
Okay.

55
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.440
We can try this.

56
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.920
Test STI.

57
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.010
Test II.

58
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.700
Okay.

59
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.320
I think we have we need a triple camera here.

60
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.450
And you can see.

61
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.730
Font.

62
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.540
Size of 20.

63
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.170
Okay.

64
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.900
Font.

65
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.620
Funds which.

66
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.770
Dead bird.

67
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.660
We can't just I think we missing one and we can either channel camera and use control and sase and as

68
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.470
well we can.

69
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.890
How the trail cover.

70
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.690
Okay.

71
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.220
Okay.

72
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.400
Now let's go back.

73
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.460
You can see stage four products and menu type.

74
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.370
A product that is going to go up and the product is going to be displayed.

75
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.790
Okay.

76
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.460
Now, one more thing we can do is.

77
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.800
We are going to be able to click on this and it's going to take us to the field screen.

78
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.790
Okay.

79
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.380
Not to do this.

80
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.070
I think we have to locate where we have that.

81
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.360
Okay.

82
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.340
We need to go to Widget and.

83
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.540
I think we could this.

84
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.490
Which record?

85
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.840
What did you call this?

86
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.250
It's a category.

87
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.330
Okay.

88
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.240
Category list.

89
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.700
Okay, great.

90
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.130
Now to do this.

91
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.580
Oh, we just have to disrupt this with a button.

92
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.420
Okay, this is gonna be a button type of gesture.

93
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.160
Just.

94
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.750
Gesture detector.

95
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.690
And as you know, the gesture detector has the on tap.

96
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:12.610
And you can see once you go to navigate or get of context and push.

97
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.410
And Matt, Syria.

98
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.800
My two page roots and.

99
00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.950
Contests.

100
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.780
Great.

101
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.610
And over here, we can have this and have a semicolon.

102
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.470
And we can then return.

103
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.280
I think we have the fields.

104
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.650
Feels queen of the fifth screen.

105
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.210
Okay, great.

106
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.740
This country NSA save.

107
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.960
Okay.

108
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.000
Okay.

109
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.550
Okay.

110
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.790
Now we can click on this.

111
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.040
Okay.

112
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.670
You can see.

113
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.100
You can't click on this area.

114
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.080
Okay, well, we can just as well.

115
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.390
We can grab that arrow.

116
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.200
Look where we have it.

117
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.710
Okay.

118
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.960
Okay.

119
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.800
This is the way you.

120
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.250
Okay.

121
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.860
We can wrap it as a gesture detector as well.

122
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.760
Wrap with gesture.

123
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.180
Detector and do on top.

124
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.980
Okay.

125
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.180
And what we can basically do is copy what we have over here.

126
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.890
Contrary to see.

127
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:31.400
And.

128
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.440
Okay.

129
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.390
Within this, we can't pin this.

130
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.650
Okay, great.

131
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.770
Okay.

132
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.080
You can go back and work on this.

133
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.180
Okay, great.

134
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.860
Now you can add more products.

135
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.430
Okay.

136
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.500
Now, if you think there's anything those missing you can do to please let me know.

137
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.760
Then again, the hard part.

138
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.240
Okay.

139
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.680
Okay, guys.

140
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.080
See you in the next lecture.
