00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.360
Guys.

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.960
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.670
Now, before, for the best of everything, it has to do with the user's authentication.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.120
Okay.

5
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.720
So now what we can do is, after this need an account, we can have another test widget over here which

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.430
is going to say forgot password.

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.800
Then on tap on that forgot password test is going to take the user to the forgot to source screen where

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
the users are going to be able to reset the password using the associated email address.

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.720
Okay.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.520
Now to do this, we're going to go to our guest code like that before we do this.

11
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.570
First of all, you get the first pass as we do see if you can implement this yourself.

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.360
So what you're going to do is after this need an account, you're going to have a test widget over here

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.610
which is going to say forgot password.

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.010
Then on top of that, forgot password says you're going to take that user to a new screen called Forgot

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.360
Password Screen.

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.050
Okay.

17
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.330
So now try to pause this video and see if you can do it yourself.

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.710
Okay.

19
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.470
Okay.

20
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.850
Now we're going to do this together.

21
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.390
Okay.

22
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.780
Now we're going to go to our logging screen.

23
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.640
Okay.

24
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560
First of all, I've just got the contract to make this way to.

25
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.580
Okay.

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.340
Contract B.

27
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.860
Okay.

28
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.800
So this is the need, right?

29
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.830
So it was all hands.

30
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.270
Yeah.

31
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.900
Okay.

32
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.180
So what you can do is you can give the train a command.

33
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.100
Now we can have another test, which is we're just going to say, oh, for God's.

34
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.530
Password because I had a question mark.

35
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.870
Okay, now we can give you a status.

36
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.680
We can a test stay.

37
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.030
Sorry to stay.

38
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.200
I think I respected that.

39
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.610
Okay.

40
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.710
Now we're going to give it a to it.

41
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.730
They're going to make it both.

42
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.990
So there's going to be Fords with.

43
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.810
Fun to it.

44
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.550
Font with that board.

45
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.820
Okay as well we can give you a font size of our bigger is going to be font size of probably 15.

46
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.270
Okay.

47
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.740
I think we need another.

48
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.280
Okay.

49
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.070
We can try to use control.

50
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.750
Needs to save.

51
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.680
Now go check it out.

52
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.820
Okay.

53
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.360
Great.

54
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.740
Now.

55
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.220
I think this is too close.

56
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.150
So all we can do, we can give you space.

57
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.400
They're going to be give it that space vertically.

58
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.730
Right.

59
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.410
So you're going to say size works.

60
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.020
So since we're giving this space vertically, it is going to be a height of probably ten.

61
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.910
Okay.

62
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.310
Trying to cover this issue.

63
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.790
Okay, great.

64
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.310
Now, what you're going to do is pull this video and see if you can make this this clickable.

65
00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.760
Okay.

66
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.310
Okay, guys.

67
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.610
Okay.

68
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.040
They're going to do this together.

69
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.030
We're going to make this test.

70
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.020
So to do this, first of all, we just need to alight.

71
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.790
Then we're going to use control dots and look like or output widgets since we don't have the widgets

72
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.900
we use in a way.

73
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.950
Okay.

74
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.500
We're going to wrap this with a inkwell.

75
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.650
Okay Canada on tap for the now that isn't a live this like this.

76
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.010
Okay.

77
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.330
I'm trying to save.

78
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.660
Reckon it's because it's not applicable.

79
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.020
Right.

80
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.680
Okay.

81
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.120
So now what this are going to do is we're going to create the forgot password screen.

82
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.770
So when the user clicks on this, this is going to take us that forgot password screen because it's

83
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.800
a us and we'll lose control of it to make this smaller than what is odd for the you can see we can clearly

84
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.550
see this, right.

85
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.390
So we're going to create a new fly.

86
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.660
We can we're going to go this way.

87
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.750
I forgot on this code password on this screen and that.

88
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.330
Okay, now for the now we can use this, the less we get since we can change it later.

89
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.720
So it is going to be forgot password.

90
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.560
Screen.

91
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.930
Okay.

92
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.649
I'll try to make this wider than regular lights.

93
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.060
Then use control.

94
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.410
Do it.

95
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.110
And that's important.

96
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.620
What you are.

97
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.130
That.

98
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.850
That package.

99
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.190
Okay.

100
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.480
Instead of returning the container, what we can do is we can return the scaffold.

101
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.760
So we have access to lots of properties.

102
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.140
So scaffold.

103
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.880
Okay.

104
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.580
Now we can have the body for the now we just need to set out we just to settle the nerves, which is

105
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.300
where we are then.

106
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.320
So this is going to be tied.

107
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.190
Okay.

108
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.830
That's me.

109
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.670
The ones that sent out the test, which it's okay for, they.

110
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.710
Now we can just sit for God's.

111
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.960
Password.

112
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.630
Screen.

113
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.980
Okay.

114
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.970
Controlling.

115
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.540
Excessive.

116
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.110
Okay.

117
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.740
Now what you're going to do is now try to implement this just when the user clicks on.

118
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.330
This should take the user to the forgot passwords creates attractive poses regional.

119
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.080
He pauses.

120
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.380
We do.

121
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.640
I try to do this yourself.

122
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.570
Okay, guys, welcome.

123
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.520
I'm going to try to do this together, okay?

124
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.560
Now, nobody's on top of this.

125
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.460
So the next night.

126
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.070
Now you're going to see Navigator.

127
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.940
Navigator.

128
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.550
The to that of contest.

129
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.170
There's going to be the push.

130
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.390
Okay.

131
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.940
Now for this, what's is going to be the Syria.

132
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.880
Let's see a page.

133
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.620
Right.

134
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.090
Okay.

135
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.890
For The view there is going to be the contest.

136
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.040
Okay.

137
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.020
We can just use our function.

138
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.330
Then this going to be what?

139
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.690
The forgot password screen.

140
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.200
Okay.

141
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.300
All right, so on.

142
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.530
It's such a no.

143
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.820
What's its aspects?

144
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.270
Okay.

145
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.130
You can see when you do that parentheses.

146
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.490
Okay.

147
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.930
Is compliance issue.

148
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.580
We can either specify the type.

149
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.520
That it is a huge contest or we can just get rid of this since it allows us.

150
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.980
Okay.

151
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.820
Now let's try to click on this forgot password.

152
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.120
The can I see it's across to the forgot password screen.

153
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.890
Okay, so this was it asked you to do.

154
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.170
Okay.

155
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.270
Now you only need to follow the pattern I'm trying to follow.

156
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.430
So instead of this forgot password, you can have it test just like this.

157
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.510
That is.

158
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.720
That is to test that are going to be displayed horizontally so you can have the forgot password or by

159
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.470
something like resets link.

160
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.880
Okay.

161
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.600
So you can follow your own pattern and they don't need to follow my apartment.

162
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.010
Okay.

163
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.180
So this was what I asked you to do or what are you able to do it or.
