00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.800
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.290
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.330
Now, most of your time, you're going to have contact errors, and these errors is going to get thrown

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.880
on your vehicle, which might as well break your heart.

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.900
So now what?

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.890
I'm going to do this lecture, I'm going to try to get rid of that.

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.680
So instead of trying it at the code, you can trace on our debug console.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.770
So to do that, you have to click on this over here.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.790
Okay.

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.580
Now you're going to see something I call stock.

11
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.340
Click on that stock.

12
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.000
So you're going to see this.

13
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.590
So I'll check this.

14
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.420
All the sessions for this are going to be checked, so I'll check it as well.

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.120
Check this out.

16
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.290
Called Sessions.

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.720
Okay.

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.790
Now, when you have that error, it's not going to trade on your visa code is going to trade on your

19
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.710
the bug console.

20
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.770
So naturally, I don't apply each other.

21
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.680
It's a little hard.

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.940
We start this.

23
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.220
Okay.

24
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.670
I just started.

25
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.300
It's up to you to.

26
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.270
Okay.

27
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.060
Now I will never get to.

28
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.470
The rig is separated right now since we don't have it so that it returns the color wishes of blue.

29
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.170
Now, you can see we don't have any watch.

30
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.120
So that's obviously a.

31
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.180
What if you could check our work?

32
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.520
You're going to see that arrow.

33
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.910
Could you work also?

34
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.020
Okay, great.

35
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.570
You can see he's trying to say we need to get coalition to load that image.

36
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.930
So if not because of this, we just checked, he's gonna throw that error on our visa code, and most

37
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.970
of the time it's going to crash our app.

38
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.100
So, like I said, not to locate this.

39
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.080
They're going to click on this over here.

40
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.810
You're going to see something there called Stack.

41
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.090
I've read it online so that was I can't find does cost stack for probably you're going to see something

42
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.539
like a cost stack like on it you're going to see this breakpoints default is going to be checked.

43
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.910
So you can just object both the assertion and the court's assertions.

44
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.750
Okay.

45
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.490
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
