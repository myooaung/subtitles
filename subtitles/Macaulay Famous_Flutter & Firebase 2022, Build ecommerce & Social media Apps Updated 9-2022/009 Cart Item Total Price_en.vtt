00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.510
In this lecture, we are going to display the card items to surprise over here.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.890
To do this, we have to go to the provider directory and then the cards provider five.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.520
And we can use control and B to make this wide.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.420
And now within the cards provider class, what we have to do is to create a getter and we have to specify

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.970
first that it is a type of double and since it is a price and then we have to say get and we are going

8
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.890
to call this so to.

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.330
Price and overview.

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.190
We are going to create a var variable and we are going to call this variable filter and defaults.

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.540
We are going to set it to 0.00.

12
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.150
Okay, great.

13
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.110
And now the next step is to loop over each item we have in our cards.

14
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:15.680
And you can see currently we have just two items added to our cards and now we have to loop over each

15
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.370
item.

16
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.770
To do this, we are going to create a follow up and we can save for VAR and we are going to call this

17
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.710
item for our item and that is for each item we have in our cards.

18
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.590
For each item we have in our cards.

19
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.060
Okay.

20
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.940
That is the list.

21
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.230
Right, for our item in list.

22
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.070
Then we want to increment the total.

23
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.170
To do that, we just have to say to together.

24
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.910
Then plus E Corps.

25
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.150
And now we have to time the price by the quantity.

26
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.550
We have to do that.

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.960
You can see this item as a variable that's currently have access to all the data and fields we have

28
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.970
in this on the score list.

29
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.500
Okay.

30
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.240
And now we can say item dots.

31
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.630
Price.

32
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.410
Times the item.

33
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.260
Dot quantity.

34
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.940
Okay.

35
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.060
And lastly.

36
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.050
Okay.

37
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.870
We have to return.

38
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.440
The thoughts are variable.

39
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.290
Okay.

40
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.530
And this is basically it.

41
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.170
And the next step is to have access to this to the price of a.

42
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.770
But before we can have access to this sort of price, we first need to have access to this card provider.

43
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.370
Right.

44
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.530
Because this is the price is within this card provider class.

45
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.690
So to do this, we are going to go back to the cut screen.

46
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.350
Where we have that this water cut screen.

47
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.230
And you can see we have this stutter and default.

48
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.980
We just pass in a test, we say 0.00.00.

49
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.790
So we have to get rid of this.

50
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.700
And now we are going to call the provider.

51
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.740
Provider.

52
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.280
Provider does.

53
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.990
Of contests.

54
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.510
And first of all, we have to specify it is.

55
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.220
A type of the cards provider class and now we have access to it.

56
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.320
So via.

57
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.280
We need this as well.

58
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.530
And we then have access to everything within the cards provider class.

59
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.920
And now we just want to assess the total price.

60
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.570
And you can see this is a double and we have to convert this.

61
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.990
We have to convert it to a string and we can just say dots to string as visits.

62
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.140
So had that extra zero.

63
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.430
Okay.

64
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.100
And this is basically it's use control.

65
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.089
And as to save.

66
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.490
Okay.

67
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.150
You can see this is 500 and this is 50.

68
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.970
And click on this 600.

69
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.020
You can see.

70
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.280
Okay, currently you can see I think we have just four.

71
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.070
Hi.

72
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.300
Same in stock for this product.

73
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.990
Okay, let's go check it out to confirm what you can see for PCs available in stock.

74
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.320
So we can't we we cannot order more than what the seller has.

75
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.570
OC 700.

76
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.090
Working as expected, and we can just add another product.

77
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.220
Others and.

78
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.070
Okay.

79
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.220
So we're not just going to get rid of this distraction.

80
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.860
Okay.

81
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.610
Okay.

82
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.610
I think we have just one of this item.

83
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.030
You can see what pieces?

84
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.960
We're going to have another this and for now and.

85
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.050

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.010
I think we have eight of this item and everything is working.

87
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.610
As expected.

88
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.070
