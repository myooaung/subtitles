00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.180
Welcome in this lecture.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.990
You're going to learn to.

4
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.670
Not to create harbor.

5
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.770
Okay, then that's to do this.

6
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.960
We're going to need to go to the home screen, because that is where we have all the screens.

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.500
Okay.

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.940
Now, this scaffold property or the scaffold widget has a property known as harbour.

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.270
And there's going to be harbour as well.

10
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.110
Okay, Harbour.

11
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.240
Okay.

12
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.830
Nice country.

13
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.730
And that's the same.

14
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.110
And we'll check it out.

15
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.759
You're going to see the harbour, right?

16
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.060
Okay.

17
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.920
You can see now what we can also do is we can see they're going to colour.

18
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.590
So this harbour has a property known as background colour.

19
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.490
And for the background colour we can use the background colour defined in the colours, fire in the

20
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.460
colours, but we can now we can use control and save and now it's not going to blend.

21
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.270
Okay.

22
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.040
You can see and if you look closely, you can see we have some elevation, right?

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.810
So what we can do is we can get rid of that elevation.

24
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.250
Okay.

25
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.800
Not to get read the harbour property as well.

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.770
Has the property known as elevation and then we can set it to zero.

27
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.090
That is, we don't want any use control and that's the save.

28
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.020
And okay, you can see now it is now blend with the background.

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.240
Okay, now they have the property or the harbour widget also has a property known as tied to what it

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.740
like to take a test widgets.

31
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.090
And we should just going to say meat and meat and chat.

32
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.260
Okay.

33
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.960
Now, how did you come over here?

34
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.550
In order to get a very good format and then use control and then save.

35
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.350
And you're going to see it.

36
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.880
Okay, great.

37
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.710
Now, what we can do is we can center this to the center, okay?

38
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.870
Or we can take that to the center.

39
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.100
Okay.

40
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.550
Now, to do this, the harbor has a property known as center type two.

41
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.160
And all we just have to say is true.

42
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.680
Okay.

43
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.370
Yes.

44
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.870
Culture and safe.

45
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.500
And you can see, okay, now all you can also do is it says widgets has a property known as PI and is

46
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.390
going to be test pi.

47
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.340
Okay.

48
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.570
So I guess you want to start the tests and why we are saying how we want to start the test.

49
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.380
Okay.

50
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.850
All right.

51
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.730
You can see font size of it seen.

52
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.690
Use country and save.

53
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.010
This.

54
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.370
Okay.

55
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.250
I think it became very small.

56
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.530
Or you can just change to 19.

57
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.350
You can also change the color.

58
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.870
You can see color and you can see colors that white default is already white.

59
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.240
Right.

60
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.220
So I'm just trying to do this.

61
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.550
Okay.

62
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.710
You can see accuser Eddie White, okay, as well.

63
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.330
You can change the font suite.

64
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.930
And this is going to be font suite, font suite, dots and bold.

65
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.170
Or you can also see the W, that is how bold you want it to be.

66
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.960
Probably you can see don't want it to be that bold.

67
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.310
Then you can just see.

68
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.060
500 or 600.

69
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.430
Okay.

70
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.050
It's true.

71
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.820
And SCC.

72
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.070
And the check it out.

73
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.300
Or probably we can just go with the boat.

74
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.200
Okay.

75
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.240
You can see a lot of property.

76
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.570
It has fonts, which font style text and a lot of keys control.

77
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.510
And that's the save.

78
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.990
Okay.

79
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.730
Okay, guys, this is physically it.

80
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.320
Now you can as well.

81
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.650
You don't really need to do it at the top yet.

82
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.580
Well, you can just do it like this.

83
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.130
Now, that should make your code more understandable.

84
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.310
But as well, you can do this at the bottom.

85
00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.029
It must just be within the scaffold.

86
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.930
Right.

87
00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.320
Okay.

88
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.990
Okay.

89
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.450
Okay, guys, see you in that Snapchat.
