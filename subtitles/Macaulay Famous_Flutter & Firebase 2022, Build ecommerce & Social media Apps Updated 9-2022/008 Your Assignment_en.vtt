00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.900
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.220
Now this lecture, we are going to create the register screen for recording.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.080
In the lecture, what I asked you to do is to create a new screen called Register or Discourse Create,

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.050
then the dots.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.680
Okay, then us to create our guest.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.590
So this was created.

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.170
That's why in the heart for the actor creating that screen in the heart folder, what I wanted to do

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.740
is to use a fitness widget and after using the fitness widget that will create some fields that is from

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.890
the full name field, the user name field, the email field and the password.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.660
So that is it this way.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380
But if you have done this, you can just look at it.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.130
So it is those four fields I mentioned or somebody is going to add some fields.

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.170
Okay, now what they're going to do now is to create the red screen.

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.620
Okay?

16
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.330
Now you can see you can really have access to the parts for the work.

17
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.750
You can do it.

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.670
You can just create this screen over the screens for the then let our regular move it.

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.400
So it is going to be sort of correlated.

20
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.830
So I guess that's great because if they just call it sign up because it's all of like that's probably

21
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.080
you in them is or just do it that way outside of the screen.

22
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.420
Then the official undercut.

23
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.130
Okay.

24
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.770
Now you can see it is not in the same directory.

25
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.400
Now what we can do is we can now move this over.

26
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.310
So what I can do is I'm to go to my files.

27
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.570
We can just drag and drop.

28
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.650
Okay.

29
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.560
I don't look in.

30
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.270
They can fix it.

31
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.920
As I'm going through this long journey, they're going to go to believe that if you use screens, they

32
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.430
will cut this off from you and then we'll look at it.

33
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.630
And this awards for the great.

34
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.080
Now over the side of my brain.

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.420
What you can do is you can have is that less?

36
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.260
We get that less, which is as well we can call this.

37
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.810
Sign of.

38
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.550
Screen.

39
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.669
Or you can be registered as Korean.

40
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.750
It's not really a big deal.

41
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.560
And although you're going to a party much you add to that package.

42
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.790
So when I like for us then what is country red dot airport and lets you out of that package?

43
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.180
Okay.

44
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.500
Now what they're going to do now, if you have not done it before the deal is what's it going to do

45
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.370
now is to try to create those four fields on your hold.

46
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.270
That is the key for them to build.

47
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.310
The user needs to take him there.

48
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.490
Filled out a password.

49
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.540
So try to pause this video right now and try to implement it yourself.

50
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.940
Okay.

51
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.020
Now, if for reasons that you for some reason you can still do, it is absolutely fine.

52
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.560
But I the question is do it in the master or the process.

53
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.550
Okay.

54
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.240
So now is it a return, a scaffold?

55
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.340
What we can do is do it.

56
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.110
So you solve it on the container.

57
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.970
What you can do is do it on the scaffold.

58
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.790
So we us has the book of properties.

59
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.170
The scaffold.

60
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.680
Okay.

61
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.320
So now try to pause the video or try to do it yourself.

62
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.260
Okay.

63
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.320
Is it because they can't access the sign?

64
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.090
So now what you're going to have is a body.

65
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.020
Okay.

66
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.040
Now this photo shoots a little bit vertically.

67
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.800
That is from top to bottom.

68
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.190
So what they can use is we get that color to wrap everything up.

69
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.620
Okay.

70
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.070
Great.

71
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.090
Now this.

72
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.560
Look, I take whatever we get, as you know, so it has to shoot with.

73
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.040
Sure.

74
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.770
Good luck.

75
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.820
Now, the first dose for it is going to be for the whole day.

76
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.170
Right?

77
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.850
So we're going to have to field.

78
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.890
Okay.

79
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.670
Then we're going to have the declaration is going to be into that declaration.

80
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.750
Okay.

81
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.210
Now what she can have is the excess, which is similar to the place order in Istanbul.

82
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.010
So we can just sit at your table.

83
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.100
They've just written this together.

84
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.970
Okay.

85
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.460
Control.

86
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.240
This is safe.

87
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.340
No, no, no.

88
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.940
To see this.

89
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.970
What you can't just do is go to the log in screen then.

90
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.790
When you can see kids who don't have an account.

91
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.660
We would love to click on this.

92
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.810
Need an accountant to go to the request page.

93
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.100
So.

94
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.900
I think we have the sign up.

95
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.480
So if you don't have an account, you can click on the sign.

96
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.010
That's all they can do over there.

97
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.300
We can implement that so we can send Navigator.

98
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.370
It's, of course, just.

99
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.870
It's going to be George Bush that is also published in this speech that is going to take the Syria.

100
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.940
Let's see.

101
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.940
We are lucky TV.

102
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.640
GROSS okay.

103
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.840
Now, just, you know, take in the context which is referring to where we are currently.

104
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.250
So now we're going to use another function that words navigate to the site of.

105
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.260
Sign the screen.

106
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.520
Okay, great.

107
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.090
You can travel to the UK.

108
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.460
There is no issue which are their sources.

109
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.530
They were able to go back to the scene of.

110
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.610
Okay.

111
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.040
Now.

112
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.340
When we click on this.

113
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.130
It's not going to take us to the final page.

114
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.440
Right.

115
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.820
Okay, great.

116
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.460
Now, first of all, we're going to take this to the center.

117
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.210
And to do that over this column we have made us is going to be made up this alignment.

118
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.510
We're not sentimental, Santa.

119
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.120
Okay.

120
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.620
Great.

121
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.200
So now we're going to give it for the mean all sides, right?

122
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.520
So it's in the declaration what the course is.

123
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.680
But that is going to be line.

124
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.360
Outline it its border.

125
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.130
Okay.

126
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.610
Take it out.

127
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.860
Okay.

128
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.850
Great.

129
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.220
He's going to have a critical role there.

130
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.300
Now when you click on this, we're going to get this screen color that'll get rid of this the.

131
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:36.740
The Declaration as well as a simple clause but assessment of the outline.

132
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.340
Into Florida.

133
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.840
So now we can see both sides.

134
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.670
Both sides.

135
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.560
This the colors of the green.

136
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.970
So we're going to change the color to colors that look.

137
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.670
Okay.

138
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.640
I think we need one more hydration, Nicola.

139
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.310
I can try to save.

140
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.320
Okay.

141
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.440
Now you can see it's is gone now.

142
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.750
So what you can do is to remove the border, right?

143
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.830
So what you can see now is we can to outline if it's border.

144
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.330
Evidence of what size?

145
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.860
So we're going to set it aside.

146
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.770
That means we don't want anybody outside, but that's not okay.

147
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.140
Now, you can see we can barely know now.

148
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.780
This is it says dude.

149
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.410
So what you can do is within the declaration as well.

150
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.460
You can do this in the way of what was within the declaration.

151
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.570
Because if you.

152
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.630
So true.

153
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.450
So this is going to give a gray color.

154
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.920
So it's filled.

155
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.350
Okay, great.

156
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.540
Now what you can do, you can do this as opposed to this edge over here and push to the right here.

157
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.080
Now, what we can do is we can use it today.

158
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.860
So you have assets to the property.

159
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.810
What they can do is drop this column with a container.

160
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.660
So when these red dots look good throughout this mountain, they give a pardon.

161
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.710
It's going to be a hedge instead.

162
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.870
It is said that all or probably 20.

163
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.730
Okay, then go check it out.

164
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.490
Okay.

165
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.340
Isn't abuse is between this and think.

166
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.170
Okay, great.

167
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.700
Now on your who now try to implement the rest yourself.

168
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.530
That is the user name, the email and the password.

169
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.610
And as well you can just hot button the register puts into it as well.

170
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:36.960
Okay.

171
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.320
Okay, guys.

172
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.260
So now what you can do is you can just.

173
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.840
It is going to copy this now, since you should master some parts.

174
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.070
Okay.

175
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.080
Then what is this?

176
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.750
This should be at your.

177
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.780
Username.

178
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:56.940
Okay.

179
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.550
Now I'm going to give some space between.

180
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.630
So what you can do is all you can have is size.

181
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.380
Looks like you are going to do this biz vertically.

185
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.470

Now audio.

187
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.210
Now I'm going to stop this video you own.
