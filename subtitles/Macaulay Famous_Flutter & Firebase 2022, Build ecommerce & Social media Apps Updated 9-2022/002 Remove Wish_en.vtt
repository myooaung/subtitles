00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.620
In this lecture, we will be able to remove item from our wish list.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.320
To do this, we have to go to the provider directory and then the wish list on the score provider file.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.220
And the first step is to create a function.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.750
Over here we are going to create a function by saying void and we are going to call this function remove.

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.020
We move which.

8
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.740
Okay.

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.620
And over here, we are going to pass something known as ID, which is going to serve as the product

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.220
ID.

11
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.420
And we could also specify it is a type of string.

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.000
And now we just have to say is to call the on the score.

13
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.590
Least.

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.340
Then dots remove where, remove where and remember the elements.

15
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.090
You can see this element as a variable that has access to all the data we have in the underscore least

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.660
variable.

17
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.210
So we can basically just rename this or we can say where element.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.280
Element.

19
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.580
Dodds.

20
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.160
Lament Dodd.

21
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.860
So element document ID is equal to this ID.

22
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.990
And now whenever we call this remove, which we then have to pass the value to this variable called

23
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.530
ID, use, control and save.

24
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.220
And lastly, we also have to say notify list in our.

25
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.440
Notify.

26
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.630
Notify listener.

27
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.460
Notify listeners.

28
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.490
Okay.

29
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.550
See all three Staten.

30
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.570
Can this go do this again?

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.510
So it's all to predict for us, not notify.

32
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.240
Listeners.

33
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.240
Okay, great.

34
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.670
Now you can try next to save.

35
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.669
And what then we are going to do is.

36
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.250
When we click on this, we want to hand the product to our wish list and when we click on it again,

37
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.970
we want to remove it from our wish list.

38
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.950
To do this, we have to go to the products detail, the detail directory, and then the products detail.

39
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.490
And you can see why we are saying provider that's of provider then of contest.

40
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.990
And over here we are passing the wish list provider to say we want to have access to everything that

41
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.990
is within the wish list provider class.

42
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:55.770
And you can see over here we are checking if the class document ID is equal to the product ID, then

43
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.880
we want to print.

44
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.190
We want to show a test message to the user, which is going to say item already in cards.

45
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.120
So it hides them already in which list.

46
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.620
Okay.

47
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.480
Now what we can do if the high time is already.

48
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.680
Hadad then we want to be able to remove it.

49
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680
To do that, we are just going to call the contest.

50
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.610
Contest.

51
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.370
And as you know, you can call the provider.

52
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.150
You can call the provider contest.

53
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.090
And you have to pass list to force.

54
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.350
Right.

55
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900
So we're just going to call the contest that the treat.

56
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.770
And we have to specify, we want to have access again to the wish list provider and then we can call

57
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:48.080
that function called remove which and now we have to pass the value to that variable and for the value

58
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.120
is going to be the product ID.

59
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.830
So we're basically saying where the card ID is equal to the product ID.

60
00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.200
So to have access to it, we have this variable called product products list.

61
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.320
And product ID.

62
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.180
Okay.

63
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.780
This is basically it helps.

64
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.450
If it has not been harder, then we want to have it.

65
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.760
Okay.

66
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.600
Just control and save.

67
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.310
And I think in the last lecture, I made a mistake.

68
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.420
I changed.

69
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.000
This should be.

70
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.030
Your car is empty and not your wish list.

71
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.010
I think I mistakenly changed this card.

72
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.860
Screen attached to your wish list is empty, so make sure you change us if you made a mistake.

73
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.930
And for the wish list screen.

74
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.800
It should be.

75
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.330
Your wish list is empty.

76
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.670
It's unnecessary.

77
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.350
And let's go check this out now and.

78
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.580
Okay.

79
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.360
Click on this.

80
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.810
I think we have successfully had a dot to our wish list and go to the profile screen and then which

81
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.000
list we can see the via.

82
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.850
And now let's click on it again to get rid of it.

83
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.050
Okay.

84
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.730
Click on it again.

85
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.300
Okay.

86
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.090
This should get rid of that tab.

87
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.410
Okay.

88
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.690
Your wish list is empty.

89
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.150
Since school.

90
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.030
Okay.

91
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.980
Let's try to add multiple items.

92
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.300
So I wish list to make sure everything is working as expected.

93
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.880
Okay.

94
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.640
About this.

95
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.640
Okay.

96
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.150
And this.

97
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.900
And let's go check it out.

98
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.520
In which this sounds cool.

99
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.980
And let's see if you can remove just one.

100
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.330
Okay.

101
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.180
Click on this and get rid of it.

102
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.930
Okay.

103
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.730
And let's go check.

104
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.190
Okay.

105
00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.940
Gone.

106
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.540
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
