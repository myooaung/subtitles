00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.589
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.080
Now, assume that don't have an account.

4
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.060
What we can do.

5
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.290
We can create a register button away.

6
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.270
So on top of that, blockchain is going to take the user to the register page.

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.720
Okay.

8
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.840
Now to do this, we're going to go back to our visa code.

9
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:16.620
Okay.

10
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.560
Now out of the inkwell, I'm going to give a trailing comma.

11
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.610
Okay.

12
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.640
Now you're going to have to test what is going to say.

13
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.870
Don't have an account.

14
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
The order is going to say register and display this to test horizontally.

15
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.160
So for this level of using what's a row widget?

16
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.300
Okay, well, before then, I'm going to give space between us.

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.780
We get over the next we had so it says books.

18
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.690
And we're going to give this space vertically that is from top to bottom, and it's going to be the

19
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.140
height.

20
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.740
Probably going to see 20.

21
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.940
Okay.

22
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.190
Great idea.

23
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.780
Truly come over that.

24
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.790
We're going to have a role with you tonight.

25
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.810
So this 644 widget so it as the children property.

26
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.200
Okay I just got this call chance to save.

27
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.050
Okay.

28
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.690
Now the first chart you're going to have is a test which.

29
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.150
Right.

30
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.660
This is just going to say don't.

31
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.080
Okay.

32
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.480
What I can do is the school of.

33
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.190
I don't.

34
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.360
Have an account.

35
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.340
Okay.

36
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.500
They're not going to give this is time.

37
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.550
Because this time there's going to be a test tie.

38
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.060
We're just going to give a font size of points here.

39
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.900
Okay.

40
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.460
He's are necessary.

41
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.420
Go check it out.

42
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.320
Okay.

43
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.990
Now what we can do, we can since had is so over this rule.

44
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.790
We can see the main US alignment when us is.

45
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.889
Main us is our main centre, physical centre.

46
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.750
It's horizontally.

47
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.520
Okay.

48
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.090
Great.

49
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.330
Now the other child is going to be a test wicket as well.

50
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.560
So after this test, which is we're going to have another test we did.

51
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.030
It's just good to see you, sir.

52
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.930
Okay.

53
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.030
Now observing the stages.

54
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.420
So this time is going to be test.

55
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.220
Stay.

56
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.770
Okay.

57
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.720
Was able to give a font size of 20 as well.

58
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.810
But this time around, I'm going to give a collar.

59
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.860
So I'm going to say color.

60
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.630
Call us.

61
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.100
Sorry.

62
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.550
Is that what it call?

63
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.400
Okay.

64
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.220
But in.

65
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.390
Ports of call.

66
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.960
Okay.

67
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.620
Hide your credit coma.

68
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.580
I think we are seeing more and more autotrader.com as well.

69
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.310
The chain of command is control and has to save.

70
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.560
Okay.

71
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.340
Go check it out.

72
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.790
Okay.

73
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.560
Now I'm going to give some of that space between this dot an account and this register.

74
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.840
So over this test, we get.

75
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.240
They're going to see this as close.

76
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.710
This time around, I don't think you disperse horizontally.

77
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.840
So that is from left to right.

78
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.170
This is going to be weeds or from the five genesis's.

79
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.550
Okay great.

80
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.480
Now so able to make this work is touches clickable.

81
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.960
So what you can do the corrupted city button is going to be a type of inkwell so we can use control

82
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.030
dots grab what we did.

83
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.140
Okay.

84
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.690
So now we're going to see ink.

85
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.350
Inkwell.

86
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.450
Okay.

87
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.030
We can just add this or tab for now.

88
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.680
Then leave it empty.

89
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.340
Okay.

90
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.280
Okay.

91
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.940
Great.

92
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.579
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
