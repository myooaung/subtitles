00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.440
Now, what you're going to do in this lecture is whenever we click on this, we want to print something

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.780
into the book console.

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.180
Okay?

6
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.920
Not to do this as well.

7
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.260
We're going to make this function reasonable.

8
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.270
So what we can do is over here, we can create a finer and this is going to be a type of void callback.

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.280
We can get rid of this and we can call this on press.

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.230
On press.

11
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.890
Okay.

12
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.190
Grace.

13
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.810
And I said of this, we can get rid of this and call the press.

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.130
On crest.

15
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.450
Okay, great.

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.870
Now, then, this thing is to pass it on to the constructor.

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.690
So over here, we can add the channel color and say this dots on press.

18
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.510
And away we can make it required.

19
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.650
Okay.

20
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.290
Definitely.

21
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.750
We're going to have an arrow via.

22
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.230
Okay.

23
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.950
So what we can do is that or press then the positive value to it.

24
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.580
Okay.

25
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.110
For the now we can just say prints.

26
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.290
Prince.

27
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.060
Go.

28
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.600
Go.

29
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.480
Sign.

30
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.290
And okay, now we can also start this and check it out.

31
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.670
Okay.

32
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.170
Terminar and.

33
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.950
Then.

34
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.480
Experts.

35
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.270
Okay.

36
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.720
Okay.

37
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.940
Now let's click on this.

38
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.330
Okay.

39
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.810
You can see.

40
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.170
Go, go.

41
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.660
Sign it.

42
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.070
Okay.

43
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.040
Okay.

44
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.220
Okay.

45
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.030
So I can.

46
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.640
Okay.

47
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.420
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
