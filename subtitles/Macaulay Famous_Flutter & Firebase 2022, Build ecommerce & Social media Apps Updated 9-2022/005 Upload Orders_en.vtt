00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.380
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.330
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.290
In this lecture, we are finally going to be able to place our first order to do this within the material

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.470
button and within the own press block.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.560
What we have to do first is to look over each product we have in our cart.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.360
To do this, we have to create a follow up and we can say fovea and we can call this item.

7
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.830
Then this is going to be in contest contest.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.220
And this is not going to be contest.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.060
Watch.

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.650
And the reason for this is you cannot use the context that watch within the own press block.

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.220
So this should be either contest dot read or you can just use the provider that's of contest and you

12
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.430
have to set the name to equal force.

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.180
And also, we have to specify the provider we want to have access to.

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.570
Okay.

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.000
So this is going to be the cards.

16
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.800
Provider class.

17
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.330
And finally, we just have to say that gets items.

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.830
Okay.

19
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.030
And within this function, what we want to do is, first of all, we want to create a collection where

20
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.270
all our orders are going to be stored.

21
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.930
To do this, we're going to be needing that package known as Firebase First.

22
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.610
Okay.

23
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:39.130
So what we can just do in order to make our code more cleaner, we can just create a variable to store

24
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.090
death.

25
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.340
We can't screw up over.

26
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.810
Right.

27
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.280
We can then say finer and we can just go ahead and specify it is a type of firebase faster and you can

28
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.290
cause ripple on the score faster and it's going to be equal to Firebase.

29
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.010
Faster is faster than the distance.

30
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.980
And back to that.

31
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.650
Back to that.

32
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:17.730
And over here we can then call the underscore fire protestor and that collection to create a new election.

33
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.760
And we are going to call this collection orders.

34
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.390
Okay.

35
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:30.170
And also what we can do is we can store the results in a variable called order ref, which is going

36
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.430
to equal this.

37
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.060
And also it wants us to specify the type of variable.

38
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.970
This is a type of something known as collection reference.

39
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.520
Okay, great.

40
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.540
So this is the collection where all our orders are going to be stored, right?

41
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.320
So what we have to do now is to go further by saying, Order, order, ref.

42
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.460
Photograph.

43
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.850
That is this is variable.

44
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.030
That is variable other than the dock.

45
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.550
The dock is basically referring to each other.

46
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.830
We are going to have in that order as collection and also immediately a product is ordered.

47
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.740
What we want to do is to generate a unique ID for each order product.

48
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.100
To do this, we are going to be using that package which you have seen before, which is known as your

49
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.740
ID.

50
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.480
So over here.

51
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.740
For now, we can just make this late in order to say it is undefined.

52
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.080
That is, we do not want to assign any value to it.

53
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.330
It's going to be a type of string and we can call this order ID.

54
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.680
Okay.

55
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.680
Click on this.

56
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.960
And right before this, we can then make it define.

57
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.650
I think we call this order voter ID.

58
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.130
Okay.

59
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.500
It's going to be equal to the U.

60
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.280
ID.

61
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.400
You.

62
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.290
I'd.

63
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.470
You id waiting for ock and dart v for.

64
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.290
V for OC.

65
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.810
Great.

66
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.540
And we just have to pass the order ID.

67
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.459
Okay, great.

68
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.330
And now we have to say the asset to specify the fields we need.

69
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.750
Well, before then we need to have the semicolon and before going for the.

70
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.660
It's going to take some time in order for that order to be placed.

71
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.420
Right.

72
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.570
So what we can do is we can tell Firebase that we are ready to wait for the process.

73
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.420
We get to do that over here in order to easier.

74
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.690
Wait.

75
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.880
Sorry, we have to use the async over here.

76
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.440
And right now we can say I wait.

77
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.910
Okay, great.

78
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.410
And within the set, we have to specify the field we need.

79
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.430
The first field we need is going to be the CID of the user, which basically serves as the customer.

80
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.560
UID And I think within the field we have that CID and that was one of the reasons we needed to use a

81
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.670
future beta in order to have access to that customer data.

82
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.700
You can see why we have a variable called data, which basically we basically have access to all the

83
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.640
data we have over.

84
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.730
Right click back on this and now we can say data.

85
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.800
That kid.

86
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.410
Okay.

87
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.240
And also we need the name of the customer.

88
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.370
Customer name.

89
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.580
And this is going to be guitar, I think we called it.

90
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.290
We call this full name.

91
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.310
Full name.

92
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.690
Make sure you don't have a spending mistake as you're going to say no in the database.

93
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.720
We also don't need the email.

94
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.880
Of the user.

95
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.390
This is going to be data and email.

96
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.640
Okay.

97
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.850
We also do need the address of the user.

98
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.280
And this is going to be data.

99
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.760
Address.

100
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.770
Okay.

101
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.920
And we need the phone of the user.

102
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.950
And this is going to be data and phone.

103
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.020
Okay.

104
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.920
We also need to provide.

105
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.380
For FY.

106
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.550
Image of the user.

107
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.470
And this is going to be data.

108
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.440
And I think we call ourselves.

109
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.850
Image or whatever you call it.

110
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.800
Okay.

111
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.180
Image.

112
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.700
Okay.

113
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.840
And we also do need the seller uid that is the product who posted it, right?

114
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.330
So seller erred.

115
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:06.890
And remember within the card provider class we have a property known as Seller uid.

116
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.110
I'm just going to show you this quickly.

117
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.950
Remember?

118
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.150
Okay.

119
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.640
And cut provider.

120
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.660
We have this, we tend to look.

121
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.780
Now the.

122
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.280
What's in the models.

123
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.280
Okay.

124
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.450
So within the product we have that code seller UID Right.

125
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.290
And what this product is basically doing so to access that.

126
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.290
We can then say item.

127
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.840
My time.

128
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.730
The seller uid animals are forgotten nowadays.

129
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.130
You can just go back to it.

130
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.850
Most of the time we need to do it up to five times in order for these codes to get used to you.

131
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.810
Okay.

132
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.480
And now we can store the product detail.

133
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:06.230
First of all, we need the product ID and basically this is going to be item.

134
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.510
That document ID.

135
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:16.710
Also we need the ID order, ID or ID.

136
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.230
And this is going to be the order.

137
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.310
ID.

138
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.590
Okay.

139
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.730
We also need the order image.

140
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.900
Basically the product image.

141
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.140
So this is going to be item.

142
00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.780
That image, your URL.

143
00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.610
And basically, we want to assess just the first image.

144
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:42.960
And.

145
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.800
We also didn't donate the order quantity.

146
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.870
Quantity.

147
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.160
And this is going to be.

148
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.630
I got.

149
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.140
Okay.

150
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.450
And now we need the order price.

151
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.930
For the order.

152
00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.410
Sorry.

153
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.150
Order price.

154
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.770
For the order price.

155
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.050
What we can do is we can say item.

156
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.680
Item the quantity then times.

157
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.260
Times the item.

158
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.030
Dot price.

159
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.320
Okay, so let's go.

160
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.480
And also the space does not really matter, right?

161
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.570
I'm just trying to make it more cleaner.

162
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.410
And we can have another food court delivery.

163
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.650
Delivery status.

164
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.670
And for now, we can just set it to say prepare well.

165
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.260
Okay.

166
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.980
And we can also have the delivery.

167
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.080
We leave?

168
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.990
Very.

169
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.870
Date.

170
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.610
To date, and for now, we can just leave it empty.

171
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.290
And also we can have the order date.

172
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.340
That is the date the product is been ordered and.

173
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.720
We can just get the data, the dates, the current dates.

174
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.270
The user is ordering that product.

175
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.310
To do this, we have to say date time.

176
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.850
The time, but now, sorry, not November.

177
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.220
Now this is going to give us the time.

178
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.050
The product is being ordered.

179
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.630
Okay.

180
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.190
And we can also have the payment status.

181
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.280
Okay.

182
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.150
And.

183
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.560
Different also for now is going to be cash on delivery.

184
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.610
Okay.

185
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.540
Let's Cisco.

186
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:48.930
And I think lastly, we can have the order review if the user has dropped a review or not and defaults,

187
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.970
we have to set this to force.

188
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.730
In the future, you're going to see fully all this.

189
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.500
For us.

190
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.710
F k.

191
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.460
So.

192
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.740
Okay.

193
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.030
And this is basically it.

194
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.720
Okay.

195
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.970
Okay.

196
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.140
Order a review.

197
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.580
We can use contrariness to save this now.

198
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.630
And that's good.

199
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.620
Right out.

200
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.740
Okay.

201
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.100
Okay.

202
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.030
And cash on delivery.

203
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.650
I think when they have two product up to two products.

204
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.260
And that was why we have to set up the two products and that was why we have to look over each item

205
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.040
we have.

206
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.930
Okay.

207
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.040
Cotton delivery.

208
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.190
Okay.

209
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.550
And confirm pay.

210
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.320
Okay.

211
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.880
Let's go check out to see what's going on there.

212
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.590
Okay.

213
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.750
I think he's done.

214
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.080
We can just go to this and back to this.

215
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.420
You know, that's a reload.

216
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.130
Okay.

217
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.430

219
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.230
We have a new order.

220
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:20.730
You can see.

221
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.630

Okay.

224
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.410
You can see we have three products.

225
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.960
I ordered 40 products and you can see the where you can see this side of the user, you can see the

226
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.990
customer name, the delivery date, you can see the delivery status, the email of the user or that

227
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.350

228
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:49.200
So I, I'm currently making this video August 30, 2022 at ten.

229

Ten or two.

231
00:12:52.970 --> 00:13:01.130
And you can see the order ID which was generated from the UID and you can see it is a type of string.

232
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.410
You can see the image of the products.

233
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.680
You can maybe just open this in a new tab.

234
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.570
It's a mixture.

235
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.700
Okay.

236
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.750
Why it is then?

237
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.310

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.190
You can see the profile image of the user.

244
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.020
It's going to upon this again in a new tab to see the user or that that product.

245
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.390
Okay.

246
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.860
