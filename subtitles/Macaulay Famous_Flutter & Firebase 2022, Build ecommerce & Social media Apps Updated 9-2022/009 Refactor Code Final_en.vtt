00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.980
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.600
In this lecture, we're going to have the account settings details of our year.

4
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.940
But before then, what we can do is we can make this list style reusable.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.860
Okay?

6
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.280
So over here we can alight and use control dots and extract widgets.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.160
And we're going to call this repeated.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.820
Repeat at least tile.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.180
So that could spell time.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.759
Hmm.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.580
I can spell Kate c k and now we can click on Enter and we have to copy this.

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.860
And then get rid of this and paste this and get rid of this.

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.310
And sorry, I think we also have it here.

14
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.760
We could get rid of this and paste this news conference to save.

15
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.090
And now.

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.780
Now you can see all the details are same.

17
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.740
So what we have to do is to go to where the class was created.

18
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.200
It was created whereby you can see the via class repeated list.

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.220
And over here, we have to make this dynamic so we can create a final variable and we are expecting

20
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.930
a test.

21
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.320
So this is the type of string tied to.

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.640
Look at your semicolon.

23
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.060
And finally, for the subtitle.

24
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.500
For the subtitle.

25
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.450
We can make this optional.

26
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.840
That means we do not really need to pass a value to this variable called subtitle.

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.460
So make it optional.

28
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.050
We are expecting it.

29
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.370
We are expecting the test.

30
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.940
Right.

31
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.370
So we can just go ahead and say it is a type.

32
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.970
So it is a type.

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.270
Of string and to make it optional.

34
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.100
We can then have a question mark over that and sub.

35
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.470
Time to look.

36
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.400
And lastly, we need for this trailing sorry, the leading and we're expecting an icon, right?

37
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.530
So this is going to be finer and it is a type of something known as icon.

38
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.340
Data.

39
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.010
And now we can lead in.

40
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.180
And the next step is to pass it on to the constructor or via.

41
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.480
We have to say, required this title.

42
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.840
So any time we call this, repeat that class.

43
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.040
We have to pass this site.

44
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.960
We have to pass the value to this.

45
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.380
Tighter and harder to command.

46
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.910
And we are not requiring this.

47
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.610
That means we don't really need to pass a value to this subtitle.

48
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.170
And so this is just going to be this Dutch subtitle and required.

49
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.710
And they start leading at the chain of command and click on this.

50
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.970
You can see over in this you can see we just need to require arguments.

51
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.370
And the reason for this to quiet argument is because over here we made this to.

52
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.870
The title and deleting required.

53
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.040
But for the subtitle we did not meet it required and we simply did that by adding the no check to say

54
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.090
it can be no.

55
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.220
Okay.

56
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.270
Now for this, first we have to pass the title.

57
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.310
And for the title, it's going to say email address.

58
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.590
So I think theory we made TV required a nod to okay and subtitle.

59
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.890
This is going to be for.

60
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.850
The main email address.

61
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.810
Sorry.

62
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.180
My colleague.

63
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.030
My colleague.

64
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.620
If it was G.M., it's calm.

65
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.840
And the last required field we passed was the.

66
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.230
He was the leading.

67
00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.410
Right.

68
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.540
And it's aspect an icon.

69
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.630
And this is going to be sorry.

70
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.780
Icons.

71
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.360
That email.

72
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.400
Email.

73
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.700
Now get rid of this subtitle and we're not going to have any here.

74
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.710
And the reason is because we did not meet it required.

75
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.380
But get rid of this tight lead in.

76
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.460
You're going to have a hair because we made it required and it is respecting the value to that field.

77
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.440
Okay, great.

78
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.550
And we have to do the same for this.

79
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.470
This the title is going to be for.

80
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.500
It's going to say address.

81
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.300
Sorry.

82
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.800
Not address, but phone.

83
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.170
No.

84
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.950
And.

85
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.840
The the subtitle.

86
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:32.930
ES +2348149 ten 6125 and lastly for the leading.

87
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.700
For the lead in this is.

88
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.610
I'm going to say I icons.

89
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.990
Dodd's foreign.

90
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.130
Icons that form.

91
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.630
Right.

92
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.900
Okay, we have.

93
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.720
One, two, three, four.

94
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.290
Okay.

95
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.040
Added to the cover.

96
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.160
Tied to lead in subtitle.

97
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.540
Tied to the theory fields.

98
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.680
Okay.

99
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.150
We have we basically have two fields and we made one.

100
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.120
No, that means we don't really need to parse the subtitle value and not really.

101
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.420
Four.

102
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.830
I thought it was four fields.

103
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.020
Lastly, we need a tie.

104
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.820
Two And sorry for the confusion and this is address.

105
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.490
And subtitle.

106
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.460
Could say LaCava.

107
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.290
Street.

108
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.180
Okay.

109
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.550
And lastly, we have to pass the lead in and expect an icon.

110
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.790
So there's going to be icons, dots.

111
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.270
Location.

112
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.560
Location.

113
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.140
Well, this is called pin.

114
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.810
We also have to phone already.

115
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.520
Okay.

116
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.690
You can try and save now and.

117
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.960
Okay.

118
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.650
Sorry.

119
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.380
No update yet.

120
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.760
The think we have.

121
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.380
Okay.

122
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.740
Okay.

123
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.770
So we have to change this.

124
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.590
So this is going to be tied to.

125
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.960
Right.

126
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.260
Okay.

127
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.390
Tied to.

128
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.310
Digital camera.

129
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.650
It is going to copy this and sorry.

130
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.930
Chest.

131
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.730
And we have to pitch this.

132
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.560
Okay.

133
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.060
Get rid of this.

134
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.070
So tied to.

135
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.060
Subtitle it and.

136
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.510
It's just gonna copy this.

137
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.870
Okay.

138
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.650
We said it can be.

139
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.280
No, so we have to have this threat and.

140
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.620
For the icon this is going to be.

141
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.170
Leading.

142
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.540
I'll probably you can just rename yours to Icon.

143
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.140
Okay.

144
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.590
Now you can see why we didn't really need to specify.

145
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.860
Test over yet again since we already rounded up with.

146
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.330
It says over here.

147
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.230
Okay.

148
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.810
Now his contract is a save and go check it out.

149
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.400
You can see.

150
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.290
Great.

151
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.100
Sounds good, right?

152
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:32.789
Okay.

153
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.409
Now what we can then do is we have.

154
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.380
To copy.

155
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.909
Everything via.

156
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.320
Writes everything over.

157
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.400
So it's not there.

158
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.930
Over.

159
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.330
Yeah.

160
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.300
The pardon?

161
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.170
Copy everything and it stands over.

162
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.490
Yeah.

163
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.560
Copy and.

164
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.900
PS This is chance to save.

165
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.120
And go check it out.

166
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.370
Okay.

167
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.250
Sounds good, right?

168
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.190
And you can see now we are able to scroll and you can see that test over there.

169
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.130
So it is good.

170
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.700
And now we have to change this.

171
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.120
First of all, we do not need the subtitle.

172
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.490
And that was why we made it not required.

173
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.890
Get rid of that.

174
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.770
But we can't get rid of this because we made it required.

175
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.970
Okay.

176
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.200
So for.

177
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.640
The tide is going to say it did it.

178
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.340
That's.

179
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.410
Pro fly.

180
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:49.340
Profile and for the icon is going to be icon dot and it's open we have that.

181
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.450
Okay.

182
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:58.870
And for the Thai zoo, this is going to say change password.

183
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.420
Change password and we do not need the subtitle.

184
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.190
And this is going to be icons that lock.

185
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.870
Hopefully we have that.

186
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.870
Last, but not the least.

187
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.210
This is going to say log house.

188
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.980
And we do not need the subtitle.

189
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.110
And.

190
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.390
This is going to be log.

191
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.880
Log log house.

192
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.740
Okay.

193
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.720
Is Katrina safe?

194
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.310
Used.

195
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.640
Okay.

196
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.490
Okay.

197
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.550
Not to make things much more easier to avoid such error.

198
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.200
What we can do, we can get rid of this and make it required.

199
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.850
Naked required.

200
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.170
And now we have to pass it on to this feels right.

201
00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.020
Right.

202
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.450
Subtitle it and what we can just do.

203
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.760
We can make this empty.

204
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.950
Click on this and pass the subtitle.

205
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.120
And leave it empty.

206
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.170
Okay.

207
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.040
And.

208
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.560
Subtitle.

209
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.190
Subtitle Use Control.

210
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.290
Understand how to save.

211
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.500
That's going to save you from no check errors.

212
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.540
Okay.

213
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.580
And.

214
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.530
Great.

215
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.270
Sounds good.

216
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.210
It seems good, right?

217
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:32.540
Okay.

218
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.900
But we did not have that icon caller.

219
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.000
Okay.

220
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.260
Get rid of this now.

221
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.390
Not really needed.

222
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.900
Get rid of that.

223
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.450
And for this we can then see a color.

224
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.170
Close the scene.

225
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.760
We once saw the high cones to have the sand color.

226
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.720
Hopefully this is looking way better.

227
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:00.930
Okay.

228
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.240
Hopefully this is cool.

229
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.080
We can just get rid of this color.

230
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.090
You can as well make the color dynamic as well by Harden.

231
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.510
On a variable value maybe finer.

232
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.760
And this is going to be tie up of what color?

233
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.470
And caller okay.

234
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.490
Something like that.

235
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.190
And you can then see color.

236
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.750
Color, right.

237
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.540
And you know, you have to pass it on to this constructor.

238
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.590
And with that, you can have different color for each icon.

239
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.260
Okay.

240
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.080
But I think black is okay.

241
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.880
Okay.

242
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.650
I'll be able to screw it.

243
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.270
And you can see that test over there.

244
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.340
Okay, guys, say the next lecture.
