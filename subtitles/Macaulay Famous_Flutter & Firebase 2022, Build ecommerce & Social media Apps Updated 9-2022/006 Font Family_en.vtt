00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.110
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.360
In this lecture, we're going to integrate font family.

4
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
Now, in order to do this, we are going to need to head up to our browser and then head up to fonts,

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.350
dot, google, dot com.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.610
And over here you can search for any type of font you still desire.

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.120
Okay, over here you can see we have this roboto and we can download this over here.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.790
But I'm going to use this which I've already downloaded.

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.010
I'm going to go to my files.

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.480
But before then.

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.060
Over this territory.

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.490
What we can do, we can just go to the pub spec, that YAML file.

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.580
So we are going to be able to create a folder within this mod seal vendor directory.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.510
So over here regular creates a new folder and we are going to call this folder assets.

15
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.230
Then within the assets directory, we're gonna create a new folder which we are going to call fonts.

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.670
Okay.

17
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.580
So I'm going to copy and paste that to my phone.

18
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.870
So this is it over here.

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.820
I can just alight this.

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.400
I like this and copy.

21
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.850
We can basically just copy the one you just recently dilute.

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.200
Okay.

23
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.920
So I'm going to go to my documents.

24
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.470
Sorry.

25
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.140
I think I created that project in desktop and multi-vendor.

26
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.480
I think I have a lot of projects where I can just search for multi, multi vendor and this is it and

27
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.460
assets and fonts.

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.620
And now we can paste this over here.

29
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.700
Now the next thing to do is to tell flow.

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.680
We just added this to files or these two fonts.

31
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.680
So in order to do this, we're going to need to go to the prospects YAML file.

32
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.770
And you can see we have this font central section over here.

33
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.920
So what we can do, we can all commit this out.

34
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.620
Okay.

35
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.410
Great.

36
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.650
Now is asking for the family.

37
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.540
That is the name of the Fonz.

38
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.060
We can basically give this font any name.

39
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.789
That is how we are going to be able to use that font.

40
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.410
We just had it.

41
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.770
So for this first font, just going to check the name.

42
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.980
This is good.

43
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.220
And so over this first family, we will call this brand.

44
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.000
Dash board kit that is for the board funds.

45
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.480
This is for the board fund and the location is what we can basically just do in that to avoid mistake.

46
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.650
We can.

47
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.310
Click on this.

48
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.450
So it is.

49
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.560
And.

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.320
Do I see if we are renaming it and use control and aid to our lights and then copy.

51
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.580
So now we are going to need to go back to the pub that sparked the fire and.

52
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.140
The location is in.

53
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.600
Assets slash funds slash this.

54
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.310
We can get rid of this.

55
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.080
Okay.

56
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.350
Get rid of that and we can get rid of this sty.

57
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.190
We don't want the photo to be italic.

58
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.320
Okay for the second phones.

59
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.580
I think we have that too.

60
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.680
That is for the board and the semi board or semi board or any are you pronounce it.

61
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.940
Okay.

62
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.570
So for this we can call this.

63
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.230
What is the cord?

64
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.010
We can call this.

65
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.480
Okay, we can just call this.

66
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.040
Sorry, we can call this brand dash.

67
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.150
Regular.

68
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.360
Regular.

69
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.330
Okay.

70
00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.720
In order to avoid mistakes again or spell error, we can just do a c phone rename and use control A

71
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.040
to copy this.

72
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.900
Okay.

73
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.350
You can basically call this any name you desire.

74
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.630
The main important thing is the path to that force should be correct.

75
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.260
So what we can do, we can get rid of this because this is a wrong location.

76
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.870
Our phone is located at assets and funds and then we can pay this.

77
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.680
OC.

78
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.300
We don't really need this.

79
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.860
You can get rid of this or you can just say outboard or heartsick.

80
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.990
You want these funds to be by hiding the weeds so you can get rid of this.

81
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.160
As well.

82
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.630
We can get rid of this.

83
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.970
And now what we have to do is to use control and as to save in order to get what we just did.

84
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.370
Okay.

85
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.340
This is going to take some time and.

86
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.970
Before.

87
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.960
Then we can just remove this unnecessary comments.

88
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.890
Hopefully we have no errors.

89
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.190
OC is going to close this.

90
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.810
Okay.

91
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.880
We can remove this unnecessary comment.

92
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.120
Okay.

93
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.110
And I think it's done, hopefully without any errors.

94
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.180
I'm just going to provide some weather.

95
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.840
Okay.

96
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.050
Not only.

97
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.780
Okay.

98
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.450
Sorry.

99
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.650
I think it's a bit slow.

100
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.380
I suppose Pakistan.

101
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.250
But most of the time it is recommended you stop your harp and rerun.

102
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.040
I'm just going to try and save again.

103
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.170
So what we are simply saying the name of the font, we are basically given the name of the phone's brand

104
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.650
board and you can basically call this any name view.

105
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.130
You can basically give the phones, the font, family, any type of name you you desire.

106
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.350
You can give it any type of name you desire.

107
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.210
The main position is the location to that phone is correct.

108
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.570
So you can see over here we are giving the Ford family brand both and we said this is the location in

109
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.980
order to access the phones.

110
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.620
So whenever we want to use these phones or we just have to do is to refer to this thing.

111
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.840
So by referring to this name, we are simply tell the floater that we are going to need to use this

112
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.880
phones and as well as this.

113
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.020
I want to use this for it.

114
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.540
We can basically just refer to.

115
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.070
This browed, regular, browed, Dutch regular.

116
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:55.780
So most of the times after did a little of this is why it is recommended you stop your have and we wrote

117
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.770
that in in this lecture will see you guys see the next lecture.
