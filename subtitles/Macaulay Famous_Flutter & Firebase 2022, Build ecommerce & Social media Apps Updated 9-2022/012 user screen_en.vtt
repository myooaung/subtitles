00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.610
Hi guys welcome in this lecture are going to make up of ice cream look much nicer.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.010
Okay.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.660
No, really, you don't need to follow this lecture because you can easily just create your preferred

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.750
screen design from scratch.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.090
Okay.

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.020
Probably over here because of its equal avatar.

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.640
That is the user profile image.

8
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.190
And via you can now just email address of the user via you can have the others of the user and so on.

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.600
Okay.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.920
So you don't really need to follow this lecture.

11
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.150
You can just create your own profile designed by yourself.

12
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.880
Okay, now to do this, I'm going to copy this code design.

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.660
Okay.

14
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.960
Now from this.

15
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.530
The court is going to be available to you if you don't want to do yours from scratch by yourself.

16
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.870
Okay.

17
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.000
I can't.

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.420
I just think I have to scroll down a bit.

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.530
And over here.

20
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.520
And it's a copy.

21
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.260
Okay.

22
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.680
That is everything within.

23
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.930
Everything from the scaffold.

24
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.349
Okay.

25
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.130
Okay.

26
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.930
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.350
Okay.

28
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.920
It's fancier.

29
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.790
Okay.

30
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.960
Nice country.

31
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.560
And see.

32
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.700
Then.

33
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.150
For five screenwriters.

34
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.200
Okay.

35
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.590
And we're just going to get rid of this scaffold.

36
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.040
Okay.

37
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.890
Get rid of this and then piece this.

38
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.240
Okay.

39
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.170
Definitely.

40
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.830
We're going to get some errors, right?

41
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.150
Okay.

42
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.110
Now.

43
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.660
Look, you can see we need.

44
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.370
The.

45
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.940
I think we have it over here.

46
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.420
Okay.

47
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.350
Okay.

48
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.680
You can see it wants us to initialize this.

49
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.360
We have this copy.

50
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.120
This will basically enable the user to scroll vertically.

51
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.420
Okay.

52
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.370
I think you're going to see this shortly.

53
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.850
Okay.

54
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.020
You can use this here.

55
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.030
You can see.

56
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.750
Okay.

57
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.140
Now I think of The Wizard of Oz doing these dates.

58
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.560
Yeah.

59
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.700
And.

60
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.250
We have those.

61
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.540
We have this okay.

62
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.560
Within the United States.

63
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.770
Right.

64
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.120
Okay.

65
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.420
Okay.

66
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.690
We need to praise the Sierra.

67
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.200
It's okay.

68
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.130
So.

69
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.030
I think.

70
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.260
Over a year.

71
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.530
So I.

72
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.940
What we can do is.

73
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.760
Cofidis and.

74
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.040
He's okay.

75
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.130
Okay.

76
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.200
No.

77
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.800
I think also, look, we need to impart this.

78
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.580
Okay.

79
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.010
Okay.

80
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.870
This.

81
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.820
Okay.

82
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.640
If you don't know what is in these states, does this.

83
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.770
I mean, these are visits this profile screen is to automatically triggered this function.

84
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.730
Okay.

85
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.490
So that's what it's basically does.

86
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.760
Okay.

87
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.390
Now this.

88
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.200
Well, to start this and go check before I screen.

89
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.830
Okay.

90
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.680
Okay.

91
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.200
Okay.

92
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.240
Okay.

93
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.130
Okay.

94
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.540
Profile screen.

95
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.730
Okay.

96
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.430
You can see.

97
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.030
Can see.

98
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.460
Like I said, you don't really need to do something like this.

99
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.040
You can have your own profile design, probably you can have the email address, then you can then display

100
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.810
the email on the can.

101
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.670
Just basically do this with something, not as least tie.

102
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.040
They've done the watch list.

103
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.420
Science, you can let me know.

104
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.970
So I'm going to make a video or that for you.

105
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.850
This basically the stock is in on watch.

106
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.980
Difficulty.

107
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.930
Yeah, shortages.

108
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.200
That is going to take some time.

109
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.510
Mostly this variable just is basically just a you can use a column for this.

110
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.750
This is a divider, it says.

111
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.120
And there's a list that is to tie to.

112
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.230
And I think we have in the list.

113
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.610
So we have the types of property, we have the subtitle, we have the trailing and others.

114
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.970
Okay.

115
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.410
So now we're going to display it.

116
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.340
Right.

117
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.740
Okay.

118
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.170
So this is where we have the email address.

119
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.130
Right now, you can see this is the least what we just did was to make it reusable.

120
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.480
That is, we created just one this die.

121
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.170
I made its words reusable so that I will love clothes.

122
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.370
Okay, so don't let this confuse you.

123
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.520
It is not really a widget, but we just made just one list.

124
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.950
I think you can see.

125
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.720
You can see the tie to the subtitle and that that's basically the property of at least life.

126
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.670
You don't know all this is you can just let me know.

127
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.780
So this is just erasable widgets, okay.

128
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.510
So if I.

129
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.050
Get out the dollar sign.

130
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.750
I didn't call their name, I think.

131
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.250
Email.

132
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.670
And over year.

133
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.110
You can't see on this score.

134
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.630
So.

135
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.430
Yeah.

136
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.540
Okay.

137
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.650
So.

138
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.630
And call the underscore name.

139
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.170
I think that was a tough field.

140
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.370
We of fresh so far you can see just do some walk away.

141
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.670
You ready?

142
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.540
No rights.

143
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.770
Okay.

144
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.440
You can had some more fruits of air.

145
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.010
And why?

146
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.890
If you've forgotten, you can just.

147
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.980
Try to see if you can go back to that lecture or I don't just copy and write.

148
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.640
I just do that.

149
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.460
You can just actually copy everything here.

150
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.590
Copy everything you write.

151
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.180
And then.

152
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.670
Create your own folks.

153
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.830
Chance you get the.

154
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.870
Data from the faster better save that is this function.

155
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.850
Try to write this yourself, okay?

156
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.410
And do the same thing.

157
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.080
Remember, we are basically using the in this date and that's automatically what reviewed the.

158
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.510
We just because when we actually reload that page it was showing now.

159
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.280
So this is one click refresh or review.

160
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.530
Okay the harder we start this.

161
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.510
Maybe.

162
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.500
Don't show this, Dad, you can.

163
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.520
Please do let me know.

164
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.460
So I will try my best to explain more for you.

165
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.910
Okay.

166
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.520
Now we stop this and.

167
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.550
Okay.

168
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.090
Okay, I think.

169
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.890
Okay.

170
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.790
Great.

171
00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.420
You can see.

172
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.700
He's been this way.

173
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.980
I think for some reason our Bulldogs are not just been on time, but we have to look for a way to sort

174
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.510
that out.

175
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.910
Okay.

176
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.400
Okay, great.

177
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:17.210
So now in this lecture, we are going to fetch the race data that we have, the number of field or so

178
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.900
I don't really know.

179
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.250
Okay.

180
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.480
You can see we also do have the joint dates.

181
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.110
You can just fish for this data.

182
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.070
Okay.

183
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.810
As well, we have the image.

184
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.680
So in this lecture, there is some more data we have in the faster database.

185
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.080
Okay.

186
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.780
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
