00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.819
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:02.840
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.550
In this lecture, we are going to continue from where we stopped.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.690
Okay?

5
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.490
Now, after this size box, we can then have a column.

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.200
A column widget.

7
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:16.810
Okay.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.100
And as you know, a column can take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed vertically.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
So it asks this to drain as is property.

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.430
Okay.

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.410
And the first side is going to be a test widget and it's going to be E then.

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.490
Her name as a dream come true.

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.640
Newcomer And it's come true and safe.

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.430
And go check this out.

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.170
Okay.

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.780
Sounds good.

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.700
And now we can have another test with jets.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.300
This is going to be.

19
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.460
And.

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.660
Price.

21
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.020
I think we called it price and not product price.

22
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.340
We can just check this.

23
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.050
Go to the upload products.

24
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.370
And we call this prize.

25
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.820
And and also we have to convert this to a string.

26
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.100
Dot.

27
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.970
Sorry.

28
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.040
Okay.

29
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.580
Sorry, I think.

30
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:35.230
This that the string maybe to string as fast.

31
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.050
And we need to zero.

32
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.570
Added Newcomer.

33
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.360
And youth culture and as a safe.

34
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440
And she said, over there.

35
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.400
Okay, so it's good.

36
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.950
And we can then say cross assess alignment, cross assess.

37
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.800
Alignment.

38
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.860
Don't start.

39
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.900
You already know what that's going to do.

40
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.640
And now we can start this.

41
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.100
And test.

42
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.889
Sigh.

43
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.360
We can change the colour.

44
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.520
See colours sign.

45
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.900
Okay.

46
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.240
This country needs to save.

47
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.400
And what we can also do, we can say man as a lament man.

48
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.280
Axis alignment.

49
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.190
Assess alignment.

50
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:44.840
Men is going to wait till the space is really in order to make this to test widgets have a core space

51
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.860
vertically.

52
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.460
Okay.

53
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.780
Go check this out now.

54
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.040
Okay.

55
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.300
Sounds good.

56
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.050
Okay.

57
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:04.140
And what we can also do is instead of wrapping this with a container and having the color or maybe some

58
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.800
border suites, we can just wrap this with a card widget or a widget known as card.

59
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.320
Hopefully I've shown you this before, but if you have not seen this before, you're going to see this

60
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.590
now.

61
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.940
A light and use control dots wrap with widgets.

62
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.320
We are going to wrap this with a card widget or a widget known as card.

63
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.300
Contrariness to save.

64
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.850
And go check this out.

65
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.370
Okay.

66
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.940
Okay.

67
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.940
Sims could and we can within the card it has the property known as elevation.

68
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.410
We can set this to be five, so make it more obvious.

69
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.030
Okay.

70
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.450
Okay.

71
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.070
I think this is okay.

72
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.280
And what we can also do is instead of having this, we can get rid of this test.

73
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.550
And first we are going to return in material and that's to have that white background.

74
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.310
And we can then have a child.

75
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.459
The child is going to be a center in order to center the secular, secular child.

76
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.540
You know, that's his center.

77
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.430
So.

78
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.580
Now that's a sense that the secular.

79
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.630
Secular.

80
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.450
Progress.

81
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.380
Indicator.

82
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.710
And you can give this colors, colors the sign.

83
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.870
Sign the spell to this way.

84
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.920
Okay.

85
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.320
And I think we need this.

86
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.050
Why?

87
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.780
Okay.

88
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.070
And if there is error, we can just wrap this the sensor to display that error.

89
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.330
Okay.

90
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.230
We can as well.

91
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.760
How the train out by.

92
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.840
Okay.

93
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.020
Go check this out.

94
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.460
Okay.

95
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.970
You can see, I'm just going to hard to start this again.

96
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.580
Okay.

97
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.600
Okay.

98
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.450
We can't search for just foreign.

99
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.120
And just fun is going to be displayed.

100
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:32.860
I think for now you can see currently we are having this issue and the issue is if we type in maybe

101
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.460
a carpenter later, okay, you can see it as a capital letter.

102
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.610
But whatever is more later and the reason we are saying this is because we have this more later.

103
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.380
PE Right.

104
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:56.350
So what we also have to do is if we have a product name which was uploaded using a capital letter,

105
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.770
you can see this product name, the P is in capital letter.

106
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:07.270
And if the user is searching based on small data, it would be difficult for that product to be displayed

107
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.240
because it won't be compatible.

108
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.300
So what we can do is over here, we can also convert this to a lowercase.

109
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.850
This country needs to save.

110
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.270
And go check this out.

111
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.520
I think we are going to have an era.

112
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.980
Yes.

113
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.030
We are going to have an error.

114
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.690
Okay.

115
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.580
Not there.

116
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.800
You get it?

117
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.430
Sorry.

118
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.560
Satellites and.

119
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.640
Okay.

120
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.570
Got it from here and test it over.

121
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.540
And also, we also do have to convert it to a lowercase.

122
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.830
So.

123
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.200
Okay.

124
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.080
Use control and save now.

125
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.450
And Azimi.

126
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:06.090
The product was uploaded in a capital form and the user is searching for the small litter.

127
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.440
We are just converting both to a lowercase.

128
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.550
Right.

129
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.180
Okay.

130
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.020
Else it won't be compatible.

131
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:23.680
You can see we have this big lit up placemat and if you type in as of before or as of then, if you

132
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.680
type in the simulator, you are not going to see this big letter.

133
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:39.250
P Right, because it is not compatible, but currently we have converted it to a lowercase so you can

134
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.590
basically see it, right?

135
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.010
So it's going to see that it's going to see both as lowercase.

136
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.760
You can see currently you can see this, but as of before, you can only see this product.

137
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.180
And the reason for this is because we have this big letter.

138
00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:04.810
P and also you can see we also have this small letter P so it's it's will always search for the product

139
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.660
based by the product's name.

140
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.230
Okay.

141
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.200
So now we can search for women.

142
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.950
We can see women products are going to be displayed and it's working perfectly where we can also search

143
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.180
for maybe shoes.

144
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.460
I don't think we have any products.

145
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.660
Shoes.

146
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.180
Okay.

147
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.900
I don't think we don't.

148
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.760
I think we have shot.

149
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.080
You can see.

150
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:38.330
So all the names that are the product name we shot are being displayed.

151
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.640
And Cisco, you can just get rid of this television if you don't like that.

152
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.430
And also, we can wrap this with the padding.

153
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.560
Pardon?

154
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.400
Maybe ten should be okay.

155
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.230
For all sides.

156
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.950
Yes.

157
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.250
And use control necessary now and we'll check this out.

158
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.270
Okay.

159
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.030
Okay.

160
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.090
I think this is okay.

161
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.570
I think this elevation looks very weird.

162
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.310
We can just get rid of that.

163
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.860
Okay.

164
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.840
And.

165
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.840
Wait for this.

166
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:19.880
Okay.

167
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.630
I think this is a bit cool.

168
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.580
Okay.

169
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.620
Okay.

170
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.870
Okay, guys, say it in this lecture.
