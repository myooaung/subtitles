00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.830
Walker In this lecture, we're going to continue from where we start, but before then, we are going

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.000
to change this icon.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.260
So the heart icon.

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.680
Okay.

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
Now to do this, we are going to go back to our VSC code and then the home screen.

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.140
Okay?

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.780
Now we can use control and B to make this white.

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.480
Now instead of this home.

10
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.960
This is going to be hot.

11
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.650
Okay.

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.540
Now youth culture and SSA are going to change that are to look like the tick tock.

13
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.000
But for now we're just gonna go with this.

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.290
Okay?

15
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.100
Now what we can do is we can get rid of all this liberties.

16
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.770
Okay.

17
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.370
Get rid of this.

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.350
Get rid of this.

19
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.130
You can as your heart if you if you want.

20
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.600
It's okay.

21
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.890
Get rid of that.

22
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.190
And this control and this is save and go check it out.

23
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.940
Okay, great.

24
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.530
Now, the next thing we are going to do is when a user clicks on this, they're going to take the user

25
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.490
to a new page where they're going to be able to upload a video.

26
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.910
Okay.

27
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.390
Now we can then use control and B to make this right.

28
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.720
Okay.

29
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.800
Now, who are the screens?

30
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.640
I will create a new high.

31
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.210
And we're going to call this Phi.

32
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.570
Home of the score.

33
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.490
So we had.

34
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.680
On the score video on the score screen in this section, the darts.

35
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.930
Okay.

36
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.870
And now we can get seasons of this widget.

37
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.430
And since we can change it later, if the need arises as well, we can call this odd video screen.

38
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.690
Okay Control and be an overlay highlight and use control and dots in order to import the material that

39
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.510
okay nice enough, it's only the container that can resolve a scaffold in order to have access to lots

40
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.740
of properties.

41
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.130
Okay.

42
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.150
Scuppered.

43
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.060
Okay.

44
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.260
Now we're going to have the body.

45
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.139
Okay.

46
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.080
Now we can either center to center to widgets.

47
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910
They're going to be in the middle.

48
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.370
Okay.

49
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.020
Okay.

50
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.830
The child is going to be in what's in basically the Equal Time Inc well.

51
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.060
Inkwell.

52
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.680
Okay.

53
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.660
This sticks in the top, as you know.

54
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.080
We can just leave it empty for now.

55
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.170
Right.

56
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.150
And as well to the child property.

57
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.080
Sorry.

58
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.130
Child.

59
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.750
The child is going to be a container.

60
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.410
Okay.

61
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.250
We can just use control necessary for now and go to.

62
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.940
The cause.

63
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.200
Dot, dot fi.

64
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.070
Okay.

65
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.800
I think this should be it now, instead of this.

66
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.280
They're going to use the hard video.

67
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.110
Had video screen.

68
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.190
Okay.

69
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.080
All right.

70
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.140
And he's controlling dots.

71
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.190
Okay.

72
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.240
In parts.

73
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.600
Okay.

74
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.940
The chain of command.

75
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.390
Okay.

76
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.600
Yes.

77
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.880
Control necessary and.

78
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.990
Click on this.

79
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.890
Okay.

80
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.080
The kid is going to start this.

81
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.180
And.

82
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.420
Okay.

83
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.370
Okay.

84
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.930
Nothing.

85
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.900
So now we're going to go back to the hard figure.

86
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.060
Now the video screen.

87
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.110
Okay.

88
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.760
Now what we can do is we can give this a weight.

89
00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.040
Sorry.

90
00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.290
Weeds, weeds of hundred.

91
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.550
Thus our weight is going to be the bottom and hides of hundred.

92
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.540
Okay.

93
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:40.260
And we can navigate, which is going to be a test widget and it's just going to say had video.

94
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.870
Okay.

95
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.100
Nice to see.

96
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.430
Okay.

97
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.170
Digital via.

98
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.200
Okay.

99
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.440
Now, what we can do is we can add the background color to this.

100
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.260
So to do that, the container has a property known as decoration as the box decoration.

101
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.470
The.

102
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.760
So we can then see color because there's going to be debates in color, which I think is.

103
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.660
Red.

104
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.180
Okay.

105
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.040
Okay.

106
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.850
I think the weight is too small.

107
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.660
We can't use.

108
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.960
190.

109
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.670
Okay, that's a.

110
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.320
Okay.

111
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.630
And.

112
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.450
Sorry.

113
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.790
I think the height is too much.

114
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.170
We're just going to use 50.

115
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.270
Okay.

116
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.180
Now we can then take this test to the center of the container.

117
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.370
Why isn't a rapid center?

118
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.780
Okay.

119
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.100
Okay.

120
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.050
Now we can give this some style.

121
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.380
So this movie starts with test STI.

122
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.730
Okay.

123
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.690
Just I.

124
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.980
Okay.

125
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:27.520
We can say font size of probably we can use 22 and we can also see color is going to be color start

126
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.940
black.

127
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.450
And we can say fonts.

128
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.890
Which is going to be fonts which.

129
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.880
Vote.

130
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.330
Okay.

131
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.190
Okay, great.

132
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.250
Now, you now understand what this week does and what the does as well.

133
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.550
Right.

134
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.950
Okay.

135
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.150
This.

136
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.890
Basically, it's.

137
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.750
Later on your future, we're going to say this to look just like the.

138
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.100
Tick tock on.

139
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.440
But for now, we are good.

140
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.880
Okay.

141
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.120
Okay, guys.

142
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.190
Seen in this lecture.
