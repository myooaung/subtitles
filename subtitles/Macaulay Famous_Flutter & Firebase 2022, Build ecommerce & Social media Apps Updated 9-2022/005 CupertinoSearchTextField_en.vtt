00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.340
Now, what we are going to do in this lecture is whenever the user clicks on the search field, it's

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.480
going to take the user to the set screen where they're finally going to be able to search for products.

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.130
Okay.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.390
Now I know that to do this, we are going to need to go back to our VTS code and then first of all,

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.930
we have to go to the home screen and we can use control and B to make this right.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.270
Okay.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.450
Before then, what we can do instead of space between, we can set space evenly in order to have a clear

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.370
space.

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.180
Okay.

12
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.990
Great.

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.100
And now we have to make this clickable.

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.930
In order to do that.

15
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.420
Over this container we're going to highlight and we're going to wrap it with a widget.

16
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.360
And this widget is going to be a button.

17
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.950
We have different type of button, but I'm going to use the inkwell.

18
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.140
Okay.

19
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.319
The hinkel has a property known as on tap.

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.470
And for now we can just leave it this way.

21
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.020
And what we have to do now is to create that sketch screen page.

22
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, what is this directory?

23
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.430
We are going to create a new folder and we're going to call this folder inner on the score screens.

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.830
Then over this dinner on the score screens, we can then create a new file.

25
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.130
And this is going to be the search or the score screen.

26
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.250
Then this picture is dot, dot.

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.810
And now we can use control and B to make this white.

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.510
Okay.

29
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.800
The first step is to create a stateless widget and search screen.

30
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.590
And over here we need to highlight and use control and dots in order to impart the material that that

31
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.910
package in order to have access to lots more property.

32
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.600
We can then return a scaffold and not a container.

33
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.530
Scaffold.

34
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.750
And as you know, the scaffold has a property known as Harbour.

35
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.790
Hubba.

36
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.170
Okay, great.

37
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.760
Now, what we want to do is whenever Hayes clicks on this, we want to take the user to this screen.

38
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.100
Okay, back to the home screen.

39
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.090
And over here, we're going to use this which you've seen before.

40
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.950
That is the navigator.

41
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.480
Towards Hoff contest and Lloyd's push.

42
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.240
The roots.

43
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.040
It is matt syria.

44
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:52.840
Page roots and this is going to take in context and we can specify it sees a type of build contest.

45
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.300
Okay.

46
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.960
And over here, we have to return.

47
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.130
We turn the search.

48
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.040
Screen.

49
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.430
OC highlights a youth culture dot in that that's important.

50
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.640
And over here we need a semicolon.

51
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.280
Okay.

52
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.680
I think we are missing something.

53
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.170
Okay, we can just get rid of this.

54
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.910
Okay.

55
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.060
Now we have to halt.

56
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.170
We start this.

57
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.260
Cards we started.

58
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.620
And this will take some few seconds.

59
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.310
Okay.

60
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.020
And now click on this.

61
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.930
Okay.

62
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.950
You can see it took us to this screen.

63
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.090
Okay.

64
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.000
And.

65
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.790
Back to the inner screen for the inside screen.

66
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.990
And as you know, the harbor has a property known as background color.

67
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.070
I'm going to show you this.

68
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.010
You can see currently we have this back arrow.

69
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.880
Okay.

70
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.880
This back arrow.

71
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.530
So now we can then say colors that white.

72
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.470
And we are not going to be able to see that back arrow anymore, since this is now why it's okay.

73
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.550
Now this harbour has a property known as icon theme and is going to be icon.

74
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.450
Icon team data.

75
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.960
Okay.

76
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.900
So we are basically saying how we want to style that icon over there.

77
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.380
Okay.

78
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.420
We can say colors dot black.

79
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.010
Okay.

80
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.440
And you're going to sit back now.

81
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.690
Okay.

82
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.210
Now we can remove this elevation or this shadow in order to do that.

83
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.340
The harbor has a property known as elevation, and we can then set it to zero.

84
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.110
And they're not going to see it.

85
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.500
You're going to see now it's going to blend with the background.

86
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.700
Okay.

87
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.220
And within the harbor has you know, the harbor has a property known as title.

88
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.460
And for the title, we're going to use this widget which you've not seen before.

89
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.980
It is known as Cooper Zeno.

90
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.570
Capacitor surge test field like measure, it says test field.

91
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.470
We also do have the capacity to test field.

92
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.940
So make sure what you're using is a such test field and use controller.

93
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.490
And that's to say you're going to see how powerful it is.

94
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.180
Okay.

95
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.020
Sounds good, right?

96
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.580
Okay.

97
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.010
We can go back and whenever use a user wants to search for products, click on this.

98
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.450
It's going to take the user to where they are finally going to search for whatever they desire they

99
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.590
can search for.

100
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.850
Maybe.

101
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.850
Maybe Gucci and the products are going to be displayed over here.

102
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.530
Seems good, right?

103
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.420
And you can see it has this out of the box for you.

104
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.670
You can see how powerful the says this field has.

105
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.150
Okay, click on this.

106
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.760
You can see it automatically clears whatever we have typed in so far.

107
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.460
Okay.

108
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.360
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
