00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.740
Walker Now, in the next few lectures, we are going to start using asset management with provider.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.160
Okay.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.770
But before then, what you are going to do is we are going to recreate this model.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.610
Okay.

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.110
Now, over this model's directory, we are going to create a new PHI and we are going to call this PHI

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.840
products dot dot.

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.170
Now.

9
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.020
Again, it's just this close to that flight.

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.420
But since it saves all this data over here, we can't just leave it for now.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.840
Okay.

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.270
Now, again, it's contributing to this wide.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
Then they're going to create a class and able to call this class.

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.470
That's right.

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.370
Okay for dogs then?

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.850
They're going to need to have this.

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.440
Okay.

18
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.890
Now the first field we are going to need is the height of the product.

19
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.730
So you can say fine a.

20
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.810
It is a string, then it.

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.300
Then we as well need the title of the product.

22
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.000
So you can just call this title or you can call your product name or whatever.

23
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.200
Okay.

24
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.290
As well, we need to distribute distribution of the products.

25
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.980
So string.

26
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.070
This creates.

27
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.800
Shell.

28
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.570
Right.

29
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.040
Fine.

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.760
We also need the prize.

31
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.030
FINA This is going to be double.

32
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.280
Basically something that has you can say 0.14.5, right?

33
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.640
Like a decimal point.

34
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.080
Okay.

35
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.930
So this is the type of double, which is just a type of number.

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.680
So we can call this price.

37
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.220
That is the price of the products.

38
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.610
Okay.

39
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.320
And then we can have.

40
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.550
A finer.

41
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.810
There's been a of string.

42
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.880
Then the image.

43
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.639
You can just see images as well.

44
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.650
That is the product image.

45
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.220
And as you know, the images from the firebase with us will be a next walk image.

46
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.540
Okay.

47
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.980
And that's all I know.

48
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.640
Is going to be strange, right?

49
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.010
In the product category name.

50
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.670
That is the name of the category.

51
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.890
Okay as well.

52
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.920
We can't have the quantity.

53
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.980
So it's you can see fine as well.

54
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.920
Okay.

55
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.850
And.

56
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.960
Where there's going to be call for their that's on.

57
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.640
Quantity.

58
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.110
I think I'm a horrible speller.

59
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.960
Okay, great.

60
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.440
Now the next thing is to pass it on to the constructor.

61
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.810
To simply do that, all we have to do is over here alight and use control dots.

62
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.280
Okay.

63
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.150
Now.

64
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.760
Okay.

65
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.820
Create constructor for final fields.

66
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.870
If you can't key onto that, you can just easily close the fly to open it.

67
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.270
Okay.

68
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.150
Now I will make this a name I'll give you.

69
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.080
We're going to make this.

70
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.280
We're going to have a.

71
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.570
The supplier.

72
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.670
And.

73
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.330
This as well.

74
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.850
Okay.

75
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.950
Now, what we need to do is to either make it required or make it not required in order to avoid it

76
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.180
from being required.

77
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.560
You just need to do your work to set it can't be null.

78
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.980
Okay.

79
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.440
Well, we we're going to make this required.

80
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.320
So anytime code is class code products, we need to pass this ID.

81
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.500
That is the ideal product.

82
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.070
So you can make this required.

83
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.070
As well make this required.

84
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.440
Okay.

85
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.250
Rick, this.

86
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.820
Okay.

87
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.290
Just go with this.

88
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.180
This.

89
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.519
Okay.

90
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.280
Required.

91
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.790
Okay.

92
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.890
Okay.

93
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.860
He's going to be required.

94
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.760
Required.

95
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.640
And finally.

96
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.320
Required.

97
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.210
Okay.

98
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.940
So we have one, two, two, four, five, six, seven, seven fields.

99
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.280
That is the idea of the product.

100
00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.790
The title of the product, which you can enable to put up name or the name of the product.

101
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.360
Then the description of the product, the price of the product, which is going to take the 0 to $39.

102
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.630
You can see it's going to take a decimal point.

103
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.530
So that's the reason.

104
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.430
It is a type of.

105
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.060
Double.

106
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.030
And the double is a type of lover.

107
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.060
You can see the value.

108
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.150
So say type of lover.

109
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.660
Okay.

110
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.200
The Himanshu URL of the product.

111
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.440
We call it the URL because it's going to be a network image because the products are going to recover

112
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.520
from the cloud base.

113
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.390
So it's going to have the issue to be and so once it is a URL, then the category of the.

114
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.870
You product category name, right.

115
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.040
And the quantity, that is how many items we added to our carts.

116
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.050
Right.

117
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.420
Okay.

118
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.830
Now for no reason.

119
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.550
Please don't delay this for now because you can see the schools will assess all of our data that is

120
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.130
being displayed here.

121
00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.440
Right.

122
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.720
So for so it also because of that, you don't need to delete this close bullet and your future.

123
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.060
We're going to get rid of this.

124
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.580
Because we are using this clause to using this fly via.

125
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.930
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
