00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.540
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.540
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.380
In this lecture region are displayed, you uploaded video data.

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.130
Okay, not to do this.

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.020
We're going to need to go to the video screen.

6
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.500
Okay.

7
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.130
Now, the first thing we're gonna need to do is to have access to this variable.

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.380
We have a card.

9
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.920
Video.

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.850
Right.

11
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.220
Okay.

12
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.560
They didn't have to have access to this variable were first needs to have access to this class card

13
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.790
video controller.

14
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.240
Okay.

15
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.170
Not to do this, we're gonna need to go to the video.

16
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.250
Sorry.

17
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.260
The video screen.

18
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.560
And now we can use control and B to make this wide.

19
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.980
Okay.

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.620
Now, over here, we're going to create a final variable and we can specify it is a type of video controller.

21
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.900
Video controller, not a video player.

22
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.480
Controller.

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.920
Okay.

24
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.500
And they're going to call this video on this car video controller.

25
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.380
And is going to be equal parts you get.

26
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.930
Okay.

27
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.629
Kaminsky the Hodges then?

28
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.440
Okay, then thoughts?

29
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.270
Put.

30
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.380
Okay.

31
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.910
Okay.

32
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.430
I think that what we can do is a light use contract does.

33
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.170
And.

34
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.800
And.

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.370
And.

36
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.910
And.

37
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.330
And.

38
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.250
Okay.

39
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.750
Okay.

40
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.270
Okay.

41
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.750
Okay.

42
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.390
Okay they're going to be important from this gets less gets the K.

43
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.560
And now we can then pass the video controller class.

44
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.850
Video controller.

45
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.080
And colleagues.

46
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.790
Okay, great.

47
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.620
Now this is basically it.

48
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.840
Okay, now over here.

49
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.380
Okay.

50
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.220
Seven.

51
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.210
Okay.

52
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.800
Now we're going to need to scroll down.

53
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.330
And.

54
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.400
O'REILLY What is page view?

55
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.690
We are going to rob this page of you with something known as obese.

56
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.210
What this will do is immediately a user uploads a video.

57
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.190
It is automatically updated in the UI without having any user to refresh to city reset video.

58
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.480
Okay, not to do this, Robert, I need to wrap this.

59
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.490
Page view.

60
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.750
It's something known as what's obvious, but to not to have access to that obvious properties.

61
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.050
What we can do is we can rob this with extreme view.

62
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.580
The first like wrap with widgets.

63
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.920
And stream.

64
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.410
So we can on to this.

65
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.600
I do like this.

66
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.590
I twas before.

67
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.910
And now we can.

68
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.380
Our lights use controlled dots.

69
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.510
Like we have it over here.

70
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.250
Wrap with stream view there.

71
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.940
Okay.

72
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.040
And now we are going to need to change this to obvious because we want immediately to user a user uploads

73
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.700
a video.

74
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.570
We don't want any user currently or light to refresh.

75
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.760
We just wanted the video to be displayed.

76
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.810
That's why it's okay.

77
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.710
And now we need to get rid of this.

78
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.130
Right?

79
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.150
And as well gets rid of what we have.

80
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.440
Over a year.

81
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.940
Okay.

82
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.720
And as well.

83
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.230
Get rid of boats.

84
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.990
Okay.

85
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.080
Okay.

86
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.590
Sorry.

87
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.400
Okay.

88
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.270
Now use control and save kiddies our maze.

89
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.400
Okay.

90
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.390
Is going to handle this.

91
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.780
Okay.

92
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.050
So you see, it is so you don't make any mistakes.

93
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.310
Okay.

94
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.140
Now what we can.

95
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.330
Do know is to commit this.

96
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.590
Okay.

97
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.500
And over year.

98
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.770
We can create a rainbow to hold that fear to a hood, that rainbow we have.

99
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.100
Okay.

100
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.870
In the video controller, it can cause real data and is going to be equal to the underscore.

101
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.500
Video controller.

102
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.040
Right.

103
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.710
And now we can.

104
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.320
Assess the river by saying dots video at least.

105
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.860
Okay.

106
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.440
And now you're going to need to say we want to assess each video.

107
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.700
Okay.

108
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.290
By passing the index and over, you think we need a semicolon?

109
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.760
Okay.

110
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.470
Okay.

111
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.020
Now we can then core the data downwards.

112
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.370
Video.

113
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.020
Video.

114
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.370
Video URL.

115
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.050
Okay.

116
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.340
Okay.

117
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.150
We need you to come over here.

118
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.260
And as well, because we need to get rid of this and then say these are the war.

119
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.000
User name.

120
00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.710
Okay.

121
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.820
Scroll down and.

122
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.480
Okay.

123
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.620
Get rid of this.

124
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.020
And this is going to be data the white cap shot.

125
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.960
Okay.

126
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.060
It's going down and.

127
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.510
Get rid of this.

128
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.920
It's going to be data.

129
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.390
That's what song name.

130
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.680
Okay.

131
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.100
Okay.

132
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.660
Okay.

133
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.230
Okay.

134
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.610
Now for the likes, we need size.

135
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.220
We'll see.

136
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.450
Data.

137
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.030
That's.

138
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.740
Though.

139
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.620
Okay.

140
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.850
Nice.

141
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.780
And we need to.

142
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.130
This is a list.

143
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.230
So we need to say that Lance.

144
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.930
And that's the string.

145
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.340
Okay.

146
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.150
Okay.

147
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.380
And.

148
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.310
For this.

149
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.760
There's going to be data, though.

150
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.480
What comments?

151
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.790
Counts, I think.

152
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.150
Okay.

153
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.130
Okay.

154
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.450
And.

155
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.050
Get rid of this and this.

156
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.140
There's going to be data that share.

157
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.180
Okay.

158
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.130
Okay.

159
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.590
Okay.

160
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.860
So we also need to provide this to.

161
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.710
A string.

162
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.280
And so string.

163
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.080
Okay.

164
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.630
I think recorded what?

165
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.890
Touch.

166
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.030
Share what?

167
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.920
Acacia accounts.

168
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.450
Okay.

169
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.350
And lastly, for the five foot two.

170
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.970
It's going to be data that was certified.

171
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.270
Two.

172
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.900
Okay.

173
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.790
Okay.

174
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.740
I think this is basically.

175
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.620
It's.

176
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.140
And now we can give this an order.

177
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.700
Is that.

178
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.120
And wait for this.

179
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.030
And hopefully we've got the Harris.

180
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.990
Definitely.

181
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.190
We're going to get no Harris.

182
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.190
Okay.

183
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.190
Okay, okay.

184
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.150
Okay, okay.

185
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.690
Okay.

186
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.050
So for that, I'm just going to get rid of this.

187
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.790
Okay.

188
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.060
Still just starting.

189
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.010
And it's going to take some time and.

190
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.140
Okay.

191
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.620
Okay.

192
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.720
Okay, okay.

193
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.230
Okay.

194
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.710
Now let's check this out.

195
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.400
Okay.

196
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.720
Okay.

197
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.460
Now we have this error.

198
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.030
And the reason for this error is we need to specify now how many video we have.

199
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.920
So we need to get rid of this and we're going to need to call that video controller.

200
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.470
Right.

201
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.850
Video controller and assess the verbal video list.

202
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.010
Then that meant, okay.

203
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.790
I think for now we have two videos now how to start this.

204
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.540
Hard to start this all three stages and.

205
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.520
Okay.

206
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.010
Okay.

207
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.450
Okay.

208
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.850
Now, we're not going to get any higher ups.

209
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.890
Okay.

210
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.490
Okay.

211
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.000
Okay.

212
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.480
Okay.

213
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.930
Okay.

214
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.380
Okay.

215
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.830
Okay.

216
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.340
Okay.

217
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.230
Okay.

218
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.860
Okay.

219
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.180
Okay.

220
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.290
Okay.

221
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.760
Okay.

222
00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:41.100
No user you give the the user name and testing and capture that is the best is going to wait for this

223
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.750
to display the profile.

224
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.710
--.

225
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.260
That's what issues.

226
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.410
Okay.

227
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.330
You can see the video.

228
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.250
Okay.

229
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.500
You can screen this plane and we are waiting for.

230
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.310
The four to.

231
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.350
You're just going to check?

232
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.410
Okay.

233
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.910
They tied the profits?

234
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.790
Yeah, it's correct.

235
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.150
Okay.

236
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.270
You can sit over here.

237
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.350
Sounds good, right?

238
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:13.890
Okay.

239
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.270
I think we also have for this over here, you're just gonna check that out?

240
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.890
Okay.

241
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.460
Now, the reason we are using this, Will, is I'm just going to come to this again.

242
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.720
The reason we are using this OBE as is immediately.

243
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.120
The user uploads a video.

244
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.750
We don't want any user to refresh the screen in order to see any recent video.

245
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.340
So by using this obvious it merely is uploads a video.

246
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.410
Just going to pop out over a year without having any user to stretch for more videos.

247
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:50.890
Okay.

248
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:58.090
You can see so many videos keep coming and as these are keep going this way, new videos are just going

249
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:05.500
to be popping up with lots of new user to it that are any current logged in user to refresh to see recent

250
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.010
videos.

251
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.750
So that's what basically this will be is does.

252
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.080
Okay.

253
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.090
And you can see over here we have the video controller, Nevada's video released this video.

254
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.560
This video is in the video controller class.

255
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.610
You can see to their.

256
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.700
You can see it over here.

257
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.590
At the moment.

258
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:34.530
At this stage, we made the video list empty and you can see we made this private.

259
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.670
In other words, we cannot access is disagreeable aside this fi.

260
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.100
So all we did was to override desirable.

261
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.350
So allow has been able to what's referred to what is it?

262
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:52.260
You can see why we are transferring the value to this variable and over yet we are on a loop.

263
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.340
And now you can see over here we are had then this data to this video list.

264
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.540
Right.

265
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.990
Okay.

266
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:08.920
And over here, in order to access this video these were first needs to assess what the video controller.

267
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.440
And that's why we have to initialize it over a year.

268
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.450
Well, you.

269
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:19.550
Yeah.

270
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.050
Okay.

271
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:27.160
They know that to make our code more cleaner over here, we created a finer variable and called the

272
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.520
rainbow data and we said is equal to the video list.

273
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.060
Honest Service is quoted on this call video controller.

274
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.160
And now we can assess the video, please.

275
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.840
And then we want to be able to assess each item.

276
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.980
That was why we have to pass in the intense.

277
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.580
And over here we are in the video your real.

278
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.780
We are assessing the user name, the culture and audience.

279
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.140
And you can see we got Harris.

280
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.620
You can as well scroll to the next video and you're going to see Papa Bear.

281
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.310
You can see the user name, the capture and the song and everything.

282
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.770
And for the now, we have no we have no likes.

283
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.260
We have no comment and we have no share.

284
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.700
We just have this.

285
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.330
Continuous in the round that circle foots.

286
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.690
The ACC is working.

287
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.730
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
