00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.060
Worker Now what's your going to be doing?

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.140
This lecture is when is a clicks on any of this categories or your products related to that categories

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.020
is going to show up.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.380
For example, if a user clicks on this, what's categories?

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.079
Only phones related products are going to be displayed.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:22.470
Okay, then not to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VSC code and then we're going to

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.600
go to the provider directory and then the products that that's fine.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.050
Okay.

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.940
Now the first thing they're going to need to do is we're going to create a function or you can simply

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.050
call it a mental.

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.520
Okay, now where we can just specify that it's going to be a type of list that is going to be a type

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.070
of the products model.

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.440
Okay.

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.050
Now that you can see the production model, we have the idea of the product, the title of the product,

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.110
the description of the product, the price of the product, the imagery attached to the product, the

17
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.270
product category name as well, the quantity of the products.

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.610
Right.

19
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.970
Okay.

20
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.810
So now we can then use controlled beta to make this wide.

21
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.720
And now we can call this function find by category.

22
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.720
Okay.

23
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.750
Now, the next step you're going to need to take is you're going to pass in a dynamic variable.

24
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.150
So any time we call this function, we're gonna need to pass in the value.

25
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.200
So that variable over here, we can just specify it is a type of string since the variable is going

26
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.860
to be a test.

27
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.380
We can call this category.

28
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.960
Name.

29
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.250
Okay.

30
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.350
Now you're going to call this function.

31
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.240
Well, before then we can distort the results in the variable called category.

32
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.900
Category this.

33
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.490
And we can specify that the robot is going to be a type of list.

34
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.540
Okay.

35
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.330
And now we can then say, is it quartz you on this call products?

36
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.970
Then they're going to check for the need to say dots where?

37
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.820
Where elements.

38
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.560
Elements Dots for dots category name.

39
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.610
You can see we have access to all the products data.

40
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.000
Right?

41
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.630
Okay.

42
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.580
Product, category, name.

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.040
And now we can just go about this or a lowercase by saying dots to lowercase.

44
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.400
Okay.

45
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.680
Okay.

46
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.230
Where elements.

47
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.920
The product name dot contains.

48
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.890
The category name.

49
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.700
Remember, this is just a dynamic variable, right?

50
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.170
Later we're going to pass in the value to this variable.

51
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.600
Okay.

52
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.710
So we are simply saying we are the elements that for the category name is equal to the value of the

53
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.420
past data.

54
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.900
Right.

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.440
Then as well we can.

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.980
Conveyed this to the case.

57
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.460
Okay.

58
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.860
And over here, you can see.

59
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.310
Duke has DNC odds, so at least.

60
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.560
Okay, great.

61
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.330
Great.

62
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.930
Now, the next step to do it is to retard this dribble.

63
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.290
So by saying the return on the score category.

64
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.820
Liz.

65
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.300
Okay.

66
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.480
What you can do is you can put this inside.

67
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.250
In brackets.

68
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.840
Okay, let's make sure it is a list and then hard three dots to tell that it is a list.

69
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.990
Okay, great.

70
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.160
Now, this is basically it's nice control and that's the two.

71
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.780
Okay.

72
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.500
Great.

73
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.080
Now, this is the method to display certain categories.

74
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.830
Okay.

75
00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.990
Right.

76
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.220
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
