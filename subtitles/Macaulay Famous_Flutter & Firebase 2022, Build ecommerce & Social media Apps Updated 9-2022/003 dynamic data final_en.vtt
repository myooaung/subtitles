00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.790
Now currently we are just displaying the first products.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.660
So in this lecture we're going to be able to display the two products we have in this products variable.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.140
Okay.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.160
Now to do this, we are going to need to cut this out of this place.

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.520
Okay.

8
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.040
So what do I light?

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.850
Okay.

10
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.330
Since you're dead and with this culture and see to copy dead back speaks to the late.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.560
But it's not as if all this era is for now.

12
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.980
Okay.

13
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.340
So what you're going to do is lose control and be selected smaller.

14
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.960
Then you're going to go to the Fields Square.

15
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.750
We're going to see where we are doing this shortly over here.

16
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.840
We're going to phase this.

17
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.710
Then we can add and use control and dots that supports the models package.

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.230
Okay.

19
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.860
Great.

20
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.950
All the products.

21
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.320
Okay.

22
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.700
So now the next thing we're going to do is they're going to pass all this fills.

23
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.200
We have.

24
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
To the first Korean to do this.

25
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.910
They're going to quality.

26
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.430
This is going to cost you all this.

27
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.990
And we're going to go to the fields.

28
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.070
So that's right.

29
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.510
Okay.

30
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.650
They're going to be passing this to the constructor and you're going to accept it in the field screen.

31
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.640
So to do that, they're going to place it at the top.

32
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.050
Now, you can see we just have the image, the product name and the price.

33
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.160
So we don't actually need the quantity for that category name value.

34
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.660
Okay.

35
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.880
As well we don't need.

36
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.300
Okay.

37
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.980
I think we need the hard right.

38
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.320
We need the title, the product.

39
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.720
We don't need the description of the product.

40
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.460
We need the price of the product.

41
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.820
Okay.

42
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.570
Now we can turn a light and use control and that's you pass it on to the constructor and we can also

43
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.150
make all the fields required.

44
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.400
Required.

45
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.820
Okay.

46
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.960
Requires.

47
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.330
Requires.

48
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.560
Okay.

49
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.670
Okay.

50
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.270
That's all.

51
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.080
Now you can see we need.

52
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.060
Two sets of air.

53
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.350
Okay.

54
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.740
Sorry.

55
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.540
Already feels great.

56
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.860
Okay.

57
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.010
It's good, though.

58
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.750
Okay.

59
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.940
You can see it now.

60
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.380
So what you're going to do is.

61
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.270
Okay.

62
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.820
What you're going to do is you're going to say it.

63
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.660
The idea is going to be on this call for that's.

64
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.420
Then that is just products away.

65
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.280
Right.

66
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.880
Okay.

67
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.100
Now, rather than statically typing zero in the index.

68
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.600
Right.

69
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.070
Okay.

70
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.560
Then you're going to say, does it?

71
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.240
As well.

72
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.060
We need what we have.

73
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.350
We need a change for those of us in the tie to tie to this glory or this confidence.

74
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.850
Intense thoughts tighter.

75
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.190
Try to.

76
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.960
I think we are us the prize.

77
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.910
It is crucial for us.

78
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.820
Okay, look, we didn't pass a discussion.

79
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.300
We passed an image URL or the flag in the imagery.

80
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.460
It does not really matter.

81
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.140
We're just going to have to try it first.

82
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.760
It's going be other school.

83
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.560
Products.

84
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.410
Then it ends right then.

85
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.750
Price.

86
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.360
And finally I think that it was a real considÃ©rer is gone and the products.

87
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.920
Intends to assess each item.

88
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.170
Then this clearly does.

89
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.410
Image Yarrow.

90
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.350
Okay.

91
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.500
We need to chip away now.

92
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.330
Is this other stuff likely to happen?

93
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.090
Uh.

94
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.760
They learned that you can see how.

95
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.610
Okay.

96
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.650
Over here, we have one to generate 50.

97
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.220
Rather than doing this, regular use the length of the products.

98
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.980
Currently we have just two.

99
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.650
Right.

100
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.050
Okay.

101
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.020
So it is going to be on this call.

102
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.740
So that's.

103
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.260
Then towards land.

104
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.830
Okay.

105
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.680
Now, what you're going to do is to go back to this.

106
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.970
Now you're going to need to assess this variable.

107
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.110
They can see where it is.

108
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.820
It is not in the state class, but parts of it is in this first class that says this.

109
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.430
This this is a top level variable that says this.

110
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.400
Revenue needs to say, okay, get rid of this.

111
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.220
I need to see Richard.

112
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.470
That's.

113
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.910
Try to.

114
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.720
Okay.

115
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.850
The contest.

116
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.510
So I think that should be major.

117
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.350
That's.

118
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.860
Image the URL.

119
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.090
Click on this.

120
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.250
So this is going to be.

121
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.440
Widgets.

122
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.500
Dot.

123
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.340
Try to.

124
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.950
Okay.

125
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.940
Get rid of this.

126
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.730
And this is to be widgets.

127
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.610
We get.

128
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.980
Towards price.

129
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.820
Okay.

130
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.530
Then to string.

131
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.760
Okay.

132
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.410
I did your cover and use control necessary to try now.

133
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.330
Okay.

134
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.510
I would agree on this.

135
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.140
Then.

136
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.300
These cartoonists who.

137
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.080
Okay.

138
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.220
And go check it out.

139
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.950
Great.

140
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.250
Guess our editor is now dynamic after use the use of this index, right?

141
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.130
The Indians is referring to the high production value.

142
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.200
So is going to see these as zero and is going to see these as two.

143
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.380
If you want to statically display any of this products, you can use this.

144
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.550
So this is zero and this is one, right?

145
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.280
So it's going to see this as Xero is going to see this as one.

146
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.090
If one is statically displayed.

147
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.410
This.

148
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.220
Yes.

149
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.830
Ways you're just going to pass in.

150
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.840
We just got a fast in one of our rides and.

151
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.910
One always says glad display.

152
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.900
The second product rather agenda is the ability to pass in the intense to its display.

153
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.260
Individual products we have.

154
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.120
Okay, great.

155
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.640
Another reason is in the future, if not, and in this lecture, they're going to start using state

156
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.300
management.

157
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.640
So you're going to learn a lot to make this more cleaner and more concise.

158
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.090
Okay.

159
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.350
So now I just want to say, you can see.

160
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.660
We have.

161
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.160
Finally, just 22 generically.

162
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.550
Okay.

163
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.350
See you guys in in this lecture.
