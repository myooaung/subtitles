00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.630
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.570
Now, in this lecture, we are going to create a function.

4
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.590
So the users are going to be able to pick image from the gallery now before they in order to upload

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.680
to the first database.

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.450
What you're going to do first is to edit the rules, then how to get to this page.

7
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.340
All you just have to do is to click on the class store database.

8
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.750
They click on the rules.

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.910
It's going to take you to this page.

10
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.930
Now, I don't think yours is going to look exactly like this, but whatever it is I just have to do

11
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.250
is after the right you're going to remove Everton after it.

12
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.640
Okay, remove this as well then make sure you have your semicolon if for any reason you deleted it.

13
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.490
Okay, now you're going to be a vote now to reload and right.

14
00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.560
So I would have click on publish now as well know upload image to the storage.

15
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.690
We also need to edit this now to get to this.

16
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.010
You all, you just have to do so click on the storage, click on rules.

17
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.480
Now I don't really think this is going to look like this is ugly.

18
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.320
So I just have to do outside the.

19
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.920
Right.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.570
Right.

21
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.140
You're just going to remove everything.

22
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.220
The you can have something worse than this, you just have to remove Everton, remove this as well.

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.630
Okay so we have our semicolon at the end of it.

24
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.190
So now you're going to be able to was read right.

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.360
So over here I want to click on publish.

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.930
Okay.

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.590
Right now, they are going to create the function, so users are going to be able to pick an image.

28
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.150
Now, the logic is, first of all, are going to create a function.

29
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.980
So users.

30
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.930
Ability to take image from the gallery.

31
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.130
Then after the user pick that image from the gallery, the necessary level to do is we're going to store

32
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.200
that image in a variable.

33
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.740
Okay.

34
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.090
Now to do this, I'm going to go to our hearts controller.

35
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.860
So that's it over here.

36
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.880
Okay.

37
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.350
At the top here.

38
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.070
First of all, I basically use Control and V to make this wide.

39
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.290
Then I'm going to give it commands.

40
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.670
Probably function to peak image from gallery.

41
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.330
Okay.

42
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.170
Great.

43
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.190
Now it is going to be a function that is going to avoid you're going to call this function peak image,

44
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.600
right?

45
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.320
Recalled its peak image as well.

46
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.790
Not only is the await, so we need to pass the sink there.

47
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.300
Now, the next day I'm going to do I'm going to create a variable.

48
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.920
There's going to be a finite variable.

49
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.850
Then what we can see is the name of the variable we can call this.

50
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.780
Peaked, peaked, peaked image.

51
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.510
Peaked image is equal to.

52
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.690
First of all also I with voids.

53
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.530
Then we're going to see this image picture, which we already stored.

54
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.370
So this is going to help us to take image from our gallery.

55
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.870
So image Flickr.

56
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.880
Then I'm going to see a dot pic image.

57
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.780
Now he's asking for the source.

58
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.940
The source is going to be image source.

59
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.180
Image Source Dodds Gallery.

60
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.390
So what if we were to pick image from the gallery?

61
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.200
Okay.

62
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.880
Now after the user picked takes that image, what you are going to do is to return like a success message

63
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.050
to the user.

64
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.470
But for us to do that, first of all, we are going to check if the user actually picked an image.

65
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.000
So to do that.

66
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.090
Although you we can use an E statement because if this picked image depicts.

67
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.450
It takes a village.

68
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.730
If it is not a quota is not a quota?

69
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.540
No.

70
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.820
That is if it is not empty.

71
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.780
Then.

72
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.710
It's picked.

73
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.190
Okay.

74
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.750
I think I make a spelling mistake.

75
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.260
I am just going to copy this.

76
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.480
Or I think I can tell this like picked image.

77
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.670
If this picked image is not a question of dead ones or it's only sources message.

78
00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.460
So I to use the get get get snack bar.

79
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.140
Look for the title we can just provide.

80
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.280
Two.

81
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.300
Okay.

82
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:20.330
Now for the message we can see on this capital it is con gras to play shows your.

83
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.010
For to image has been uploaded.

84
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.410
Okay.

85
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.720
So uploaded that uploaded.

86
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.470
So it is a freshly picked and the image is going to resolve this.

87
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.430
Okay.

88
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.330
Right.

89
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.320
Okay.

90
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.800
I'm just going to hard disk semicolon.

91
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.150
Now, what I'm going to do now is to store the picked image.

92
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.720
So over here, we're going to create a global variable for that is going to be a type of PHI.

93
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.000
Then we just had the question of the state come in now.

94
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:13.760
Then we're going to call this picked for this copycat invasion that is India on this call so the because

95
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.860
a private variable.

96
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.040
So we are going to be unable to use it outside this PHI.

97
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.530
Okay.

98
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.170
Now what you can do, we can wrap this with arrowheads.

99
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.390
So it is good.

100
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.270
At least if we are changing the image, there's going to have to be time.

101
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.070
Okay.

102
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.800
So over the relatives with our ears.

103
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.650
Okay.

104
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.090
Great.

105
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.500
It's in.

106
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.450
This should be.

107
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.680
In here.

108
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.440
Okay.

109
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.820
All the same.

110
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.950
Okay.

111
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.530
So I need to pass in the late as well.

112
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.760
Let's.

113
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.150
Okay.

114
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.530
Good.

115
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.960
Now over.

116
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.270
You're saying if the image is not equal to no, that is.

117
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.720
If it is not empty, then you want to say, okay, coalition you your image.

118
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.060
So your image has been uploaded.

119
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.710
So now over you.

120
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.880
We can be assured in our store that we'll get the part of the image.

121
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.470
So to do that.

122
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:23.660
Oh just out to see is on this call, this image we created where that is our global variable, this

123
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.580
image is going to be equal to the arrow as as well.

124
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.700
So it is going to be fine.

125
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.850
If I.

126
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.110
Then what we can see.

127
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.610
Uh.

128
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.560
Or else.

129
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.770
Okay.

130
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.960
They can use the picked image.

131
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.450
That's part.

132
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.730
Okay.

133
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.270
Do your.

134
00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.930
So.

135
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.410
Five.

136
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.150
Right.

137
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.780
So we're going to pass this to see if we know.

138
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.750
Then all you have to say is this.

139
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.520
They passed the FY.

140
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.110
Okay.

141
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.790
This.

142
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.170
Okay.

143
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.030
So now we're going to get the parts of the image by send picked.

144
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.250
Pict image.

145
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.360
The image.

146
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.860
Dot pot.

147
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.650
Okay.

148
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.890
Add this as well.

149
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.049
Okay.

150
00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.140
Your circle on.

151
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.560
Let's think we were right over the key in this.

152
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.510
Okay, great.

153
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.690
Now we are going to use this we just created.

154
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.050
So to use this, we're going to go to our.

155
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.470
Our sign ups, first of all, over the.

156
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.880
Over the okay.

157
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.670
This they're going to see is really our function.

158
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.290
So there's going to be lot.

159
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.680
Both controller.

160
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.820
Dot.

161
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.440
Peak image.

162
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.570
Okay, good.

163
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:31.220
Now, the nice thing to do is to display that with us towards the parts of our image over a year.

164
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.270
So now we can see what's.

165
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.550
Oh, it's controller.

166
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.980
Well, it's called Should I Do It?

167
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:46.860
Now, you can see we don't have access to that or this image because we made it private humidity provider

168
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.120
able to get access to it.

169
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.180
We're just going to use the guitar to override that.

170
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.320
Okay.

171
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.400
So over here.

172
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.880
So over the AWS controller.

173
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.490
There's an override that so.

174
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.930
Over the course of a year.

175
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:12.220
So we just have to do is to see as it is, to create a viable code for FY.

176
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.470
So five, four, two.

177
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.300
Okay.

178
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.510
Now, when I say it's a of five.

179
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.520
Right.

180
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.860
Then over here.

181
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.610
Well, as it gets.

182
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.160
Then there's going to be.

183
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:36.040
We're going to use an arrow function that we're going to see is this is over is going to go to this.

184
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.020
More like overriding this.

185
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:44.950
So taking the very particular waters here, then putting it to this rebel quite so five footer.

186
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.430
So we're going to see on this call picked.

187
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.550
You made the for you look.

188
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.370
The value.

189
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:57.330
Okay.

190
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:57.780
Great.

191
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.280
Now.

192
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.150
Are you going to use that?

193
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:02.780
Okay.

194
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.160
So we're going to see our picks.

195
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.780
Sorry.

196
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.560
So fast forward to.

197
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.140
Okay, so what we basically did was overwrite duck or tick take.

198
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.400
What's that part?

199
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:21.280
Take the variable that they stole in the parts of the image than just black or trans.

200
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:26.500
What we did was to transfer what is due to this variable by using the gifts.

201
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.640
Okay.

202
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.860
So then when these objects are just like if you are using an iPhone, I don't think this is going to

203
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:38.890
work for you or I think probably you need some extra configuration to use the image to figure.

204
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.900
Okay.

205
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.630
I just think.

206
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.440
Okay.

207
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.200
I just think you're going to try this out yourself first.

208
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.900
Then in this lecture, I will continue from here.

209
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.750
So now all you have to do is try to pick an image.

210
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.000
Make sure you fill in all the fields.

211
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.170
Does this make sure you had a very long passport to this?

212
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.930
And in this picture, I'm going to see because I'm having in a very low key, I'm just going to do this.

213
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:09.950
Okay.

214
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.180
Now you're going to click on this.

215
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.460
Remember what we simply did.

216
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.170
Overall you.

217
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.690
We call it the function, right?

218
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.370
So we click on that icon.

219
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.350
He's going to take us to our gallery.

220
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.450
Okay, click on this.

221
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.910
Okay, great.

222
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.650
Now our gallery is open.

223
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.620
So now you can pick an image.

224
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.990
Make sure you fill in all those fields.

225
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.410
Because one of our additions is it must not be empty.

226
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:50.110
And since the password is for Firebase, because I use it to create a password, the agent is.

227
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.670
A very old controller.

228
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.070
Okay.

229
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.890
Over the old controller we are using to create user creates a user with a password so it respect the

230
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.530
password was via strong type.

231
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.920
Okay.

232
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.270
Okay.

233
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:16.660
Great.

234
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.500
Congratulation.

235
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.100
Okay.

236
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.720
You just got to try this out yourself.
