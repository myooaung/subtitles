00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.770
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.710
In this lecture, revenues are working on the joint medicine screen.

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.580
Okay.

5
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.640
Now, to do this, we are going to need to create a new fly.

6
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:18.670
So over the screens, whether they're going to create a new fly, which is going to score video on the

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.420
score call, then on the score screen, then your section wishes towards that.

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.910
Okay.

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
The Urban League needs to use culture and not to make this white.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.050
Okay.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.150
Now, we can't just go with this the less we get since we can as well change it later, just before

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.560
we get into meteorites rights.

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.670
Okay.

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.990
So we're going to call this now video call screen.

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.670
Right.

16
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.910
Okay.

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.420
And over here, we need to use the control adult.

18
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.250
And that's important to add to that package.

19
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.580
Right.

20
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.940
Okay.

21
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290
So they sort of return in a container.

22
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.100
They're just going to return to the scaffold.

23
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.830
So we have access to lots of property, right?

24
00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.910
Okay.

25
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.820
The police got your names to save.

26
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.670
Now, what's happened is we're going to go to the.

27
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.210
Mrs. Careen writes, This is the dawn medicine.

28
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.950
I can, right.

29
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.740
So as this escalates, I want to go to that page.

30
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.970
Okay.

31
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.250
So now what we can do in that to make this cleaner.

32
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.290
Over here, you can create a new function called Join.

33
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.960
Medicine.

34
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.890
Okay.

35
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.910
Right.

36
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.160
And now we can.

37
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.330
We can then see Navigator.

38
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.160
Navigator.

39
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.200
That contest.

40
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.800
Then that's push.

41
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.540
And this drought is going to be much severe.

42
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.490
Pedro.

43
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.630
Because it needs to be the.

44
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.520
With a view to.

45
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.730
It's going to take in the contest.

46
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.660
Okay.

47
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.070
A function.

48
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.010
It is going to be the video call screen.

49
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.260
Right.

50
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.390
Okay, great.

51
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.960
You can see we don't have access to contest.

52
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.450
Right, because we are outside this way.

53
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.600
This is the contest where we are outside.

54
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.410
Outside this.

55
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.150
That's not to.

56
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.820
Be able to use this contest.

57
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.770
We can't pass the contest over and we can specify the type is abuse contest.

58
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.170
Okay.

59
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.810
For some reason we see counts of assists this year in an era.

60
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.880
Now what you can do to solve that era, we're just going to convert this to state where we get these

61
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.070
controlled DOT converts that we get.

62
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.140
Okay, you can see that arrow is gone.

63
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.840
Okay.

64
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.730
Now, we don't really need this.

65
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.620
Okay.

66
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.460
Great.

67
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.970
Now over here is the joint meeting, right?

68
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.830
I'm going to get rid of this.

69
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.210
Then we're just gonna call that functional coordinator, okay?

70
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.110
We can get rid of this and make sure you your the chain of command.

71
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.550
If you go to save and then click on this.

72
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.930
Okay.

73
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.330
You can see groups.

74
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.870
Now we can start working on that screen.

75
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.970
So I'm going to go back to the video call screen.

76
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.070
Now over here, we're going to have.

77
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.150
And how are.

78
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.160
Bah bah.

79
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.760
We jets.

80
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.690
Okay.

81
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.200
Go check it out.

82
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.370
You can see what it does.

83
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.570
Okay.

84
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.440
You can see this now that we can get rid of this television, right.

85
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.850
So that it matches with the background so we can see elevation to zero.

86
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.450
I take a good look at those businesses going to school now.

87
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.680
Okay.

88
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.320
No, it's not really that again.

89
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.230
What you can do is we can.

90
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.140
So the background color should be the background color.

91
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.580
We have declared in our calls the rights.

92
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.110
Can I go check it out?

93
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.340
Knows when the match is.

94
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.310
Okay.

95
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.910
Great.

96
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.070
Now we can then have.

97
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.490
They try to.

98
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.660
And the artist is just going to say it's going to be a test with that right where she is going to sit,

99
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.100
which is just going to say join.

100
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.630
A medicine.

101
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.280
Right.

102
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.990
Okay.

103
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.760
The default for iPhone users or our users is going to be either middle or since we all know it is going

104
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.980
to be on the left side, not the ticket to the center.

105
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.150
I'll just have to say it's within the app bar.

106
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.300
You're going to need to see a center type to.

107
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.060
True.

108
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.380
Okay.

109
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.920
You can do it over here.

110
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.600
Still sensitized to what must be within the ABA.

111
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.610
Okay, great.

112
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.410
Check it out now.

113
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.720
You see, it's going to go to the media.

114
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.320
Okay.

115
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.440
I can give a font size to this so you can see this guy.

116
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.110
Is it just rights in others or all?

117
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.880
Okay.

118
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.220
So we're going to see font size of 18.

119
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.860
Okay.

120
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.760
Okay.

121
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.590
We can also say fonts.

122
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.480
Fun tweets.

123
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.790
On with the boat.

124
00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.850
Right.

125
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.290
Okay.

126
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.490
Okay.

127
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:03.280
Great.

128
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.440
Okay.

129
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.040
Great.

130
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.890
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
