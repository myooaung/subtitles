00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.010
Okay.

5
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.610
Now, in order for us to be able to upload our data here, what we need to do, we need to set up some

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.000
rules.

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.030

10
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.120
Then what we can do.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.560
We're going to get rid of this if request the time.

12
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.120

13
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.910
So it just going to get rid of this.

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.220
So from the start points.

15
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.119
Sorry.

16
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.820

Delayed.

20
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.090
Then going to the villages as well.

21
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.700
You're going to say we want to allow the rude words, right?

22
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.640
Then the next thing I'm going to do is we're going to click on publish.

23
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.510
Okay.

24
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.950
Okay, great.

25
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.110
Now, how about this data?

26
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.550
What we're going to do is we are going to create a coalition where all our users are going to be stored.

27
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.110
So what you can do over here, we can click on Start Coalition.

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.070
Now the first is asking is.

29
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.680
A coalition is a set of documents that contain data that contain data collection of users.

30
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.090
Okay.

31
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.010
So we can now be coalition of users.

32
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.370
We are all our users are going to be what's stored.

33
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.770
So what we can do is asking us to give the coalition and then we can say, is this okay that we can

34
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.760
click on this.

35
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.330
Okay.

36
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.360
Now you can see over this document ID because all of our it's provided so you can read this.

37
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.450
It said a coalition was content at least one document clarify or unite units of storage documents to

38
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.820
us views or to generated US idea.

39
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.770
This is okay.

40
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.180
So what is trying to say?

41
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:10.440
All our documents, all all our users are going to be tied to that coalition using the Heidi.

42
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.820
Okay.

43
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.240
So we can easily just use your ad ID or F user this auto generated ID.

44
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.780
Okay.

45
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.470
Now is asking for the field of the user.

46
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.130
Okay.

47
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.120
Now the first field we need is the full name.

48
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.350
Is it test?

49
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.400
Right.

50
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.840
So is it time for String?

51
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.040
So over a year, we can sit back.

52
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.460
Paul.

53
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.930
Okay.

54
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.150
Now as well we need to use the names field so there's going to be is name is going to be a fall.

55
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.040
Okay.

56
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.800
Then we need to.

57
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.700
I think.

58
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.870
We need the email field tests as if that was doing as well so that we can see for it.

59
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.060
Jim, will that come?

60
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.290
Okay.

61
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.540
Now I'm going to click on See.

62
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.660
Okay, great.

63
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.780
Now you can see this is the Heidi and this is the user.

64
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.670
These are has serial be.

65
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.890
That is the email for the username.

66
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.360
And then you can see the connection between this user and the user.

67
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.880
The user's question is, what's the ID?

68
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.430
So the ID connects votes together.

69
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.320
So this is the user, Heidi, and this is the current.

70
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.020
This is a user we have you can refer to this user as a document.

71
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.540
So you can see this is a document.

72
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.540
We have just one document inside the user's coalition.

73
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.620
So you can refer to this as a single document or you can tweet us documents.

74
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.990
Okay.

75
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.330
Now a document doing this, we are going to be creating and to creating this manually, right?

76
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.480
So what we're going to do is get rid of this user's collection.

77
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.230
Okay, so I'm just trying to show you something that was able to do this.

78
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.610
Okay.

79
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.540
So now what they're going to do is they are going to click on this.

80
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.550
Click on Delete Collection.

81
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.600
Then you can see it wants us to type in the users collections.

82
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.620
They're going to say, use this.

83
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.170
We can click on delete.

84
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.660
Okay.

85
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.860
Great.

86
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.970
Okay, great.

87
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.450
Okay.

88
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.740
