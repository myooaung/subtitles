List I that is this.

25
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.750
Okay, now, what we're just going to do is.

26
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.860
We are going to start us back.

27
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.400
Hello.

28
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380
I just want to say call us the.

29
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.960
Transference, which automatically removes it.

30
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.650
Right.

31
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.030
I'm trying this now to save.

32
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.060
And go check it out.

33
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.040
You can see this as well.

34
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.480
Nice.

35
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.850
Gone.

36
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.290
Okay, great.

37
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.690
Also, I'm just going to change this from pink to white.

38
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.150
I think I don't like that.

39
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.080
But you can live yours or probably you can use any color of your choice.

40
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.050
So I'm going to go to the bottom navigation bar.

41
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.480
Okay.

42
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.290
This is.

43
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.430
Okay.

44
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.740
The bought some location, I think.

45
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.940
I really can't find this.

46
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.270
Okay.

47
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.070
There's the wire.

48
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200
So you sort of think I'm just going to change it.

49
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.590
So I took three whites.

50
00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.890
Okay.

51
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.030
And that's it.

52
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.750
Alright.

53
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.020
So I think that's if colour okay colour starts.

54
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.000
Whites were go.

55
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.660
I just saw it says button colour.

56
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.000
But we have a rebel that is called says button colour which is a colour of whites.

57
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.510
Okay.

58
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.310
Great.
