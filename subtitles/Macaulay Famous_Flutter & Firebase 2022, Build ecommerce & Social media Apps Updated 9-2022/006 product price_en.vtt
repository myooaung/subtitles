00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.890
Walker.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.200
Now, over here, we are going to have a test which is going to say prize.

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.470
And over here, we're going to have the price of the products.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.920
Okay.

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.880
Now, to do this, I need to go back to our this code.

7
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.510
Okay.

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.550
Now we're going to be doing this.

9
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.720
We send the column.

10
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.190
Right.

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.940
But it's going to be half side the row because we do not want anything to be displayed.

12
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.720
Photo by.

13
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.550
Right.

14
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.920
Okay.

15
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.420
So now we can hard to cover.

16
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.810
Okay.

17
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.840
Now as well, we are going to be using the raw widgets, right?

18
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.880
Because they're going to have two widgets.

19
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.710
One is going to be here and the other is going to be.

20
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.390
Okay.

21
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.000
So this is going to be children's.

22
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.450
To drain.

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.380
Via Canada Trail cover.

24
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.660
Okay.

25
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.890
Okay.

26
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.590
The first chart is going to be a test widget and it's just going to say price.

27
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.970
Okay.

28
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.710
You're going to see that via.

29
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.440
Okay.

30
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.050
Now as well.

31
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.680
You can guess or cite this.

32
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.540
There's going to be a test tie.

33
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.170
And we can give a font size of 16 and font weight.

34
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.420
Font.

35
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.680
I think we have some tweets.

36
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.030
It's going to be fun with.

37
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.320
But I think.

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.850
Fun needs.

39
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.120
That have a great it's okay so w 500.

40
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.630
Okay.

41
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.290
Now we can use control and s to save.

42
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.610
Okay.

43
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.010
Okay.

44
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.390
Now, quick, check it out.

45
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.930
Okay.

46
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.860
Okay?

47
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.100
Yeah.

48
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.300
Now we can then add it to the cover and we can then have other tests.

49
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.030
Right.

50
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.970
And this is going to be the price.

51
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.490
We can't just say 600.

52
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.230
Right this underage addiction cover and you can either this.

53
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.400
For the size of 16 as well.

54
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.840
And.

55
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.380
Phones with.

56
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.160
That's okay.

57
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.330
Can Israel uses 500.

58
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.710
I think we need.

59
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.150
Okay.

60
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.320
The true coma and actual coma and yes, contrariness.

61
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.740
Save.

62
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.970
I think they are way too close.

63
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.340
So what we can then do over here, we can have a size box.

64
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.560
This is going to be with us, right?

65
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.130
Because you are given.

66
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.850
This is a resource, Ali.

67
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.410
We can see ten.

68
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.820
Okay.

69
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.630
Now he's got to finance to save.

70
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.150
Okay.

71
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.710
Okay.

72
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.000
Great.

73
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.610
Now that we can use the.

74
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.090
The back slots.

75
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.350
Sorry.

76
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.020
Yeah.

77
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.460
That's is the dollar sign.

78
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.730
So I think there's going to be this okay.

79
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.210
Okay, great.

80
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.360
Now, the next thing to do is you're going to come back from this route, right?

81
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.650
Okay.

82
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.850
Because we don't want anything to be displayed.

83
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.200
Okay.

84
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.720
As well.

85
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.430
Okay.

86
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.560
So over here, we're going to have another row.

87
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.360
And there's going to be children.

88
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.200
Okay.

89
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.649
Now, what we can just do to easy our life, we can then just copy this.

90
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.980
Copy this.

91
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.820
And.

92
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.560
We can then piece this.

93
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.640
Okay.

94
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.440
This is going to be solved.

95
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.130
Twitter.

96
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.470
So to do.

97
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.860
And you can just.

98
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.550
$1,000.

99
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.700
Okay.

100
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.060
I think they are way too close.

101
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.300
So we can't do this over here.

102
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.370
We can't see this size box.

103
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.580
Size of the space.

104
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.920
We are given the space vertically that is from top to bottom.

105
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.700
So this will be.

106
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.270
Heights.

107
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.820
Right.

108
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.200
Okay.

109
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.370
Did you cover?

110
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.310
Okay.

111
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.770
Great.

112
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.410
Okay, change this call or we can just get rid of this.

113
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.570
This board.

114
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.020
So we can't do it for the test.

115
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.320
Well, for the price, we can just get rid of this.

116
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.860
And for Luke it is a Adekola is very close.

117
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.110
The pink.

118
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.470
Okay.

119
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.710
Editorial cover in this country initiative.

120
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.010
Okay.

121
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.330
Now what we can then do is over.

122
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.280
The code we can use across us elements, across US elements.

123
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.420
Those thoughts were actually started from the hedge.

124
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.790
Okay.

125
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.980
Cross.

126
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.840
As I said, I made a start.

127
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.230
Okay.

128
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.960
Okay.

129
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.240
Nice.

130
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.400
Not starting from the end because we already have this power then, right?

131
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.790
Okay.

132
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.710
We're down just by the.

133
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.460
I think.

134
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.680
Yeah.

135
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.520
Okay.

136
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.400
Ready out this panel for the top as well.

137
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.880
Okay.

138
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.650
And you can see.

139
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.020
The size box.

140
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.640
So that's why it's not starting from this edge.

141
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.040
Okay.

142
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.230
Therefore, we should get rid of this.

143
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.830
You're going to see.

144
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.500
He's going to start from the hedge.

145
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.890
Okay.

146
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.500
Okay.

147
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.160
You can see there are all boats in the same line.

148
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.640
Okay.

149
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.520
So we can have that back.

150
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.890
Okay.

151
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.870
Okay.

152
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.200
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
