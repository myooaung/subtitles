00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.690
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:10.050
Okay, now, in the last lecture, we created this function which we record upload to storage.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.620
Okay.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.110
Now, what you are simply saying is, if all this fields are valid, then once you create the user,

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.700
which user it would email password, then as well we once to upload the image to the storage and as

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.430
well we want to add others fields.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.180
Okay.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.510
Now over here, this is a function, right?

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.650
And this is where we created it at the top.

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.410
Okay.

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.270
Now over here, what I simply said is, first of all, we said fabulous stories that rather than chide,

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.890
this child is referring to the photo.

14
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.880
So we created it for the course of, I think, with all our images, even though we thought that in

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.010
this child is the name of I wish I said the animal defy is going to be the user.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.630
Okay.

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.220
And over here we are just uploading the image.

18
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.300
That is a little pig image, right?

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.570
By using the raft to put data, that is this riff raff that puts data.

20
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.980
Then over here we are waiting for the upload.

21
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.300
Right?

22
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.940
Then over here we said Snap our services and I've got a graph that gets you over how we are getting

23
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.760
the URL.

24
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.310
The reason for this is because we are also going to upload the you are held over this.

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.450
Okay.

26
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.030
And over here we are similar.

27
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.710
It's on the URL.

28
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.210
Okay, great.

29
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.760
So now we can also say this is a type of string and you can create a array which is the this.

30
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.580
So you can set the load here also.

31
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.550
Okay.

32
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.790
It's going to be cool to do that because as with this.

33
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.700
Okay, now the next thing we're going to do now is to pass it.

34
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.800
I right.

35
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.940
So now we're going to pass it to the files to database.

36
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.480
So now, Nicolas.

37
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.300
Image.

38
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.720
Right is going to be equal to the load.

39
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.860
You have a hill.

40
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.370
Okay.

41
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.260
Great.

42
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.580
So we need more.

43
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.830
Okay.

44
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.830
Okay.

45
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.250
Now the nets they are going to do now if we should use control.

46
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.010
And B, you can see two aspects that another one will fail because we passed it to the we pass on the

47
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.950
additional fields to the sign up user that says the image.

48
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.410
That is an image which is a type of eight U.S. attorneys, which is also a tie.

49
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.510
This is also is it also a type of guy?

50
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.560
Okay.

51
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.340
So now it suspects another additional field.

52
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.490
So we are going to go now to we are raising the site of.

53
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.980
Our control would be to make this wide.

54
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.270
Okay.

55
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.260
Now less.

56
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.660
We're just going to click on this and that's it.

57
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.610
So yeah, we have this in the area that you can see right away.

58
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.060
You can see five position arguments.

59
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.950
But what for all these phones?

60
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.630
So they are missing just one.

61
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.830
So now what they're going to do is we're.

62
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.290
I'm going to have to try and accommodate the fans and the.

63
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.890
Image.

64
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.360
So.

65
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.040
So that aspect, I'm image wise.

66
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.540
So this is going to be on the score.

67
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.590
Image that.

68
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.080
Because you just look just like this.

69
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.990
I think this is just what we need.

70
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.930
Okay.

71
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.380
Now, what I'm going to do now is two or three stages.

72
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.560
So also autosave those on suit phase.

73
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.880
Okay.

74
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.960
Whereby if you don't know what this image is, this one is quite image.

75
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.580
And what we had earlier created a clever way because of this image to store the image.

76
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.660
So that is a perfect image we are passing on to that.

77
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.660
That is the victim we posting on over here.

78
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.240
You can see the type of you it is, which is a type of PHI.

79
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.560
Okay.

80
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.800
Grids.

81
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.210
Know you're going to try this out.

82
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.110
Okay.

83
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.090
I'm going to go to the sign up.

84
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.790
Okay.

85
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.320
First of all, we're going to take an image.

86
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.290
Okay.

87
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.210
This.

88
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.940
Okay.

89
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.820
Okay.

90
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.110
And I'm going to create an account.

91
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.900
So this is going to be we're going to call this.

92
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.980
Says.

93
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.990
This is a.

94
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.290
Isn't the use of space tests is a that is what is name.

95
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.190
The user name of the test is a.

96
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.640
Okay.

97
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.810
The email is going to be a test.

98
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.160
Is it Gmail?

99
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.770
It's called.

100
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.550
And the password.

101
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.130
You can just use the E.

102
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.570
Yeah, I see.

103
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.650
Okay.

104
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.360
Now we are going to click on register.

105
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.140
Okay.

106
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.690
We're kind of local to our seminar in the Balkans, so to see what is going on over there.

107
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.200
Okay.

108
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.460
The War Council.

109
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.050
Okay.

110
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.970
I think this is the creative.

111
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.770
Okay.

112
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.700
It should be done by now, but I'm thinking about it.

113
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.160
So I'm just going to first navigate to the rules.

114
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.870
Then I would get back to.

115
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.950
The data.

116
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.060
Okay.

117
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.870
Still not done.

118
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.800
If not, we have space to print out the user.

119
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.860
Okay.

120
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.800
We're just going to click on this again.

121
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.870
Okay.

122
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.240
With words.

123
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.310
Okay.

124
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.110
Now for some reasons, I think I'm having network issues.

125
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.050
So is finding it difficult to secure the user?

126
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.010
But by now use was created.

127
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.490
If you have a very strong network, then as well you're going to see a new user of a with the profile

128
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.430
image as well or the storage.

129
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.300
You're going to see that it is going to check if it is already.

130
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.290
But I know several years is the user has not been created.

131
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.340
Well, you're going to see a new.

132
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.150
Okay, great.

133
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.290
I think it's created.

134
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.210
It was the fourth chick.

135
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.090
Okay, great.

136
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.110
The test user is available now.

137
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.700
Then you can see.

138
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.200
Okay.

139
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.580
You can see now.

140
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.720
Four days created.

141
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.470
Now you can see the 4:00, four five takes was created.

142
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.520
Then you can see now the name of the fire is going to be the user.

143
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.190
Heidi, you can see it.

144
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.170
You can click on this.

145
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.130
Now you can see the uploaded image, depict image.

146
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.070
Okay, then over here you can look for the UID.

147
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.860
It ends with a one, so you can look for the ad that ends with one.

148
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.880
Okay, so this is it.

149
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.960
Okay.

150
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.820
Now you can see the image.

151
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.970
In Malawi, we said we wanted to get the health of God's image.

152
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.600
But we're going to show you this.

153
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.920
I'm going to talk to the ranch.

154
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.860
Okay.

155
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.440
Later he said, once you get it, once you get the you know, once you get to your health care.

156
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.640
So we said get out of the area.

157
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.550
So by doing that, you got into it.

158
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:26.090
Jarrell Then when I returned in it and over sudden I simply passed in that other field.

159
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:32.210
So we created a record and then we are standing next to the immeasurable goods.

160
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:32.820
Okay.

161
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.130
Right.

162
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:41.419
Well, there is implicit order created to create a food accord provided by these indirect goods tied

163
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.549
to the name of the buyer is going to be.

164
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:44.520
These are your ideas.

165
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.620
So this is exactly what you are just saying.

166
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.310
So you can see this.

167
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.160
Why I really got this?

168
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.330
Because I believe if you can get time, you kind of create all this.

169
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.710
Okay.

170
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:56.800
Great.

171
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.480
With.

172
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.820
For over a year.

173
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.250
We've proscriptive function here and we are using it up.

174
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.740
All right.

175
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:13.960
So we are simply saying before this is an authority, we want to create these ideas or to upload the

176
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:21.390
user interface to the faster, better days and also get to your real hope that we should at least open

177
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:28.070
upload in the fab is a faster and faster database.

178
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:28.480
Okay.

179
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.940
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
