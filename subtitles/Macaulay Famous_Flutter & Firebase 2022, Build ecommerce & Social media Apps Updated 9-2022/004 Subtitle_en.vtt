00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.170
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.800
In this lecture, you will fully understand what the special side does.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.430
Okay.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.980
Now it's in the special side.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.360
It has a property known as subtitle.

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
And for the subtitle we are going to be using a row widgets.

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.620
And the reason for this row is because we are going to have to test widgets.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.920
One is going to say simple and the other is going to be for the delivery status.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.610
And this two tests are going to be displayed horizontally row, then children, and then the first test

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.730
is going to say, see more and you can just add this and we can start this.

12
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.730
Sigh.

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.590
It tests time.

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.730
Okay.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.290
We can change the color.

16
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.800
Cause the sign.

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.290
Sign.

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.890
We can also make this bold.

19
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.520
Font width.

20
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.250
Found with the boat.

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.690
Okay.

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.020
I think we need this.

23
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.770
Other comer, Heidi Comer is concerned to save.

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.740
And I think.

25
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.640
Know what?

26
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.490
I think you already know how is going to display.

27
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.590
So you can just go ahead and have another test.

28
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
This is going to be for the delivery status so you can just say order.

29
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840
And I think we call this the Lee very status.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
And also we can start this.

31
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460
Just sigh.

32
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.350
We can change the color colors, the sign.

33
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.190
We can also see phones with.

34
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.130
With.

35
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.120
Funds split.

36
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.900
The Board and the why we need the newcomer and agitating to come away.

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.789
Okay.

38
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.810
Great.

39
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.220
And now it's in the row.

40
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.170
We can then say Manus Solomon's Manus lament the space between.

41
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.290
Okay, you already know what that is going to do.
