Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.500
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.490
In this lecture, we are going to be able to display similar products.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.140
Not to do this, we have to go back to our visa code.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.420
And trust me, this is very easy screw up.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:28.210
And you can see why at what we are basically saying is we want to go into the products collection and

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.220
we only want to retrieve the products where the main category field is equal to the men.

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.880
Right now, what we have to do is to get rid of this and we are going to call the product list variable.

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.890
Put up these table.

10
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.370
And over here we are going to pass the men.

11
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.130
Category.

12
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.260
And also, we are going to go further by saying that where, again, and this is going to be the subcategory

13
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.890
food.

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.810
Sorry.

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.630
Sub category.

16
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.610
How do you cover is equal to the product list?

17
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.980
Products this.

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.170
And.

19
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.620
So category.

20
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.470
This is basically it.

21
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.610
Now, what we are basically saying is we want to go into the product collection and we want to retrieve

22
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:40.420
product where the main category field is equal to the product's main category.

23
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:49.330
And also where the product we are, the subcategory is equal to the product subcategory and this is

24
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.350
basically it.

25
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.370
And now use try to save or you can just restart this.

26
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.330
Okay.

27
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.960
And let's go check it out.

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.910
Okay.

29
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.920
You can see we have just one similar item right now.

30
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.080
What you have to do is to upload product for the same category and also the same sub category.

31
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.350
And if you do that, you to have similar item.

32
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.480
So that is what you should do.

33
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.690
Now you just have to upload product.

34
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.880
Okay.

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.480
Upload.

36
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.820
You're going to upload for the same.

37
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.200
The same.

38
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.360
You can upload for the same main category for all the products and also same subcategory.

39
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:46.860
So after doing this, you have to upload another again for same main category and for same subcategory.

40
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.710
And after that you have to do that again for same main category and for for same subcategory.

41
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.280
So by doing that, you can see by doing that, you're going to have a lot of similar heights over here

42
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.620
and not just this.

43
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.160
And that is what the check is basically saying, because we are saying over here, we want to retrieve

44
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.020
products based on where the main category is equal to the main category of the product.

45
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.690
And also we have the subcategory is equal to the sub category of the products.

46
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.310
Okay.

47
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.870
This is basically it.

48
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.870
Okay, guys, see you at the next lecture.
