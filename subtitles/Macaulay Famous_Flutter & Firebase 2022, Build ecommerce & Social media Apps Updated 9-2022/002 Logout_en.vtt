00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.680
Now, before we start working on the dashboard screen, we can create the functionality to log out the

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.370
seller.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.370
Okay, now, to do this, we have to go to where we have this icon.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.190
And you can see we have that within the.

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.140
So we can go to the hub and the actions and then the icon button.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.860
And over here in the future, we are going to be using the awaits.

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.270
And in order to use the await, we have to use the async or via OC.

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.390
And now we can just go ahead and use the await.

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.500
With and faster.

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.510
Sorry firebase auth.

13
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.250
So for that those instance then dot sign up OC.

14
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.030
Okay.

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.490
This is basically it.

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.540
And you can see currently this is going to take some time to sign out to the user.

17
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.200
And that is why we are awaiting it in order to make this finish first.

18
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.190
And after this finishes, then we want to go back to the.

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.820
Stella Logan.

20
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.850
So we can say navigator now.

21
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.520
We can spell that again.

22
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.310
Navigator.

23
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.890
Those words don't push for the roots or roots.

24
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.510
It is something known as materia mathy via page.

25
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.170
Roots or roots oc contest.

26
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.970
And.

27
00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.770
Basically we want to return to the seller, log in screen.

28
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:01.580
Okay.

29
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.130
Now use control and save.

30
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.509
And let's go try this out.

31
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.740
Look, I click on this now.

32
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.850
Hmm.

33
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.660
Simms, could.

34
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.370
We can just try this again.

35
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.990
Famous store.

36
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.270
Kimmel.

37
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.410
The email mail.

38
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.560
The mail mail demanded calm and the password is BJ Mark.

39
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.920
The log in.

40
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.710
Okay.

41
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.890
Take me the.

42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.170
Okay.

43
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.680
I think I made a mistake.

44
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.480
Seymour's sister.

45
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.880
If it.

46
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.660
If it does not work this time, I'm not.

47
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.290
Okay.

48
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.610
Okay.

49
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.750
Dashboard.

50
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.760
And now we can log in and log that.

51
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.200
Okay.

52
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.010
Sounds good.

53
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.940
Okay, guys.

54
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.560
See you in the next lecture.
