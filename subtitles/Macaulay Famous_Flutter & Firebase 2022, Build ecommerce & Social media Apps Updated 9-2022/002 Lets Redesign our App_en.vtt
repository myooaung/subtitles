00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.770
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.720
Now, instead of using the red and black, we are going to redesign our have to use the black and whites.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.150
Okay.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.830
So now to do this, what they're going to do first is they're just going to remove the top ten.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.780
So now they're going to go to the OC control and B to make this smaller, then I will go to size.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.490
They are going to go to Main.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.600
That's fine.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.350
Okay.

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.110
Now is it other than the stain.

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.760
Yeah.

12
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.640
The same data that we can just get rid of this.

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.660
Okay.

14
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.530
On that then use control on this to save then go check it out.

15
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.570
Okay.

16
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.140
Great.

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.850
Okay.

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Now, what we can do is change the button color to black.

19
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.570
Like you can try to be.

20
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.500
So now you're going to go to the past.

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.980
Okay.

22
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.470
You can see where we defined it here.

23
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.280
Okay.

24
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.400
They sort of given that color, we could have just give that button quality colors of colors that black.

25
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.160
What is good to define it over yesterday, in case you want to change it, you can easily just change

26
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.400
it.

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.660
And everywhere it sort of changes in one part or the other parts.

28
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.780
Okay, so now what you can do is instead of colors start red, we can use the colors that's black as

29
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.980
well.

30
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.010
So by doing this anywhere we are using the button color is will it gets updated there?

31
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.530
It can now go check it out.

32
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.570
Okay.

33
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.280
I'm just going to have to restart this.

34
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.090
Okay.

35
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.070
What's the reason?

36
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.300
Okay, great.

37
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.650
Okay.

38
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.180
Now, what you can do is you're gonna change that test.

39
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.020
So what you can just do is you can save as well.

40
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.060
You can call this test button.

41
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.960
The color is going to be colors.

42
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.420
That's white.

43
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.650
Okay, great.

44
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.360
So now I'm going to save this file first.

45
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.910
They're going to go to the login screen first or probably the sign out.

46
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.410
Sign off first.

47
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.130
Okay.

48
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.420
So now what you can do is over the.

49
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.740
The we says log in, so we register.

50
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.860
So I was able to give a whole lot to it.

51
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.060
So this is going to be a test.

52
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.680
But then.

53
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.020
Okay.

54
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.250
Oh.

55
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.630
Can I just add color to it?

56
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.070
Okay.

57
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.060
And go back to the cost.

58
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.020
Okay.

59
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.370
Two sports in.

60
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.710
Hello.

61
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.410
Okay.

62
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.570
Untrue or just social studies?

63
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.480
Not so much by the studios on civil rights.

64
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.940
Okay.

65
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.570
Okay.

66
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.100
Okay.

67
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.880
Okay.

68
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.230
I think we did it in the.

69
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.820
Okay, great.

70
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.600
Now as well, we're going to do for the log in, right?

71
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.360
So we're just going to go to the log in there.

72
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.690
We're going to look at the log in boxes as well.

73
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.170
Okay.

74
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.560
Yes, it was.

75
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.020
I was going to give you a font.

76
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.520
So a color.

77
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.290
It is going to be test lots in Colorado.

78
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.710
Okay.

79
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.110
Great contents to save.

80
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.540
Like I said, the reason why we defined this law in a separate file.

81
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.230
Now we can basically change that without going to.

82
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.010
If we are done.

83
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.470
Call us.

84
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.430
That's why it's in order for us.

85
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.960
For example, we need to change this in all the files.

86
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.370
Okay.

87
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.270
What now?

88
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.570
Since we have a defined in one side, that is a cause.

89
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.550
But that's like we can just change.

90
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.790
The code is going to get affected in all your files where we are using the service.

91
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.150
Says Watson.

92
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.930
Hello.

93
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.380
Okay.

94
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.530
So now, for example, if we don't want to use the black and whites, we can just use the black.

95
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.970
So really white and yellow, white and red by just going to the cost.

96
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.440
That's that's why I changed this to the test button to from the yellow.

97
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.100
Okay.

98
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.660
So that is one of the reasons we have to define those colours will vary.

99
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.680
So we can easy to get us so you can easily refer to it at the time.

100
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.980
Okay, so I'm just going to start again.

101
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.250
Okay.

102
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.750
Okay.

103
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.900
Good.

104
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.660
Now we have to look at the screen.

105
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.140
We also have to set up a screen.

106
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.250
But before that, please note you must not exactly what I'm doing.

107
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.900
Right?

108
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.040
You can also have your own colors.

109
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.860
You can also have the budget to do this.

110
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.810
It doesn't really mean you must do exactly what I'm doing.

111
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.000
You can have your own design as the process is going from there.

112
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.550
You can have a color of white, yellow or white and red or white and blue or white or being.

113
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.520
So necessarily you don't have to follow the that pattern I'm trying to follow.

114
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.000
Okay.

115
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.360
So you can also have your own kind of sky.

116
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.860
So probably we can see black.

117
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.360
So now we can go to our side of the screen.

118
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.610
Then over there, instead of colors that blue.

119
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.530
Because yes, is the button.

120
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.130
So it is background color.

121
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.680
That's the color that is going to give the black white.

122
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.080
Okay, Grace.

123
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.620
I think looks so somehow.

124
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.440
So I just got to it back to do.

125
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.430
So, like I said, you don't really need to follow the exact parts on I'm trying to follow.

126
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.740
You can have your own design contact.

127
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.280
Okay, great.

128
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.470
Okay.

129
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.940
Okay, guys.

130
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.380
See you in this lecture.
