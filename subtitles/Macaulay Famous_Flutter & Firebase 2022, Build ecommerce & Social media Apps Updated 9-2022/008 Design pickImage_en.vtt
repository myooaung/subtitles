00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.390
All called now in the process of registering.

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.790
Users are going to be able to pick an image.

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.630
So what you can do well there you can have a default image.

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.020
And of that default image now going to have a camera icon.

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.770
So on top of that icon, users are going to be able to pick an image.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.160
Okay.

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.650
So now what first to do is to add the default image and on top of each other to have a camera icon.

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.430
Okay.

10
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.950
Now to do this, I'm going to go back to you could.

11
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.910
Now, I want to do this before the test feed.

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.290
Right.

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.690
So it's not just us who is becoming the first side.

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.590
We can have a stack rapidly stack because I going to place a widget on top widget.

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.950
So you basically use stock to place widget on top widgets.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.670
Okay.

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.100
So we're going to have the stack widget.

18
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.910
Okay.

19
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.750
He's going to had a train to come over to get rid of that area.

20
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.780
Now, all this stuff we just can't take.

21
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.730
What if all it adds to.

22
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.450
She did okay.

23
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.710
So the first.

24
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.790
The first charge is going to be a circle.

25
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.390
A circle of water.

26
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.380
Okay.

27
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.920
Now, you can give a radius of this to four.

28
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.210
I think that our circle is going to be also around is going to be okay.

29
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.120
So we can have the background image, which is aspects it to be the network image.

30
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.710
Okay.

31
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.190
Now I'm just going to paste this Jarrell I have on my keyboard, but you can easily go to your browser

32
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.490
search for user transference image.

33
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.500
Then click on this.

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.240
Look over here.

35
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.440
That is the VW.

36
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.500
It's pg2.

37
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.890
Okay.

38
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.410
Okay.

39
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.420
You can see the way.

40
00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.990
Okay.

41
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.560
Now, assuming we don't have good network, we just going to display a color.

42
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.610
So we're going to see how background color is going to be.

43
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.750
Colors that blue or you can see a black.

44
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.930
Okay.

45
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.250
So go check it out.

46
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.400
They can see.

47
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.620
We could have we have a good network, but you don't have a good network.

48
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.200
It's a very tight that got you know what you can do we can use pairs between this.

49
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.830
I decide not to do that I don't think you the space of vertically so this is going to be a size both

50
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.950
right size box.

51
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.760
Size box, it is going to be hard to write out of probably 20 ideas trying to come away from trying

52
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.450
to save.

53
00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.890
Okay.

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.460
Great.

55
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.610
Now I have a new place for Michael VI, so to do that over.

56
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.460
The stock widgets after the second quarter.

57
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.560
They're going to have a position which is going to how we are going to place the icon or whatever I

58
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.280
want to place.

59
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.880
Okay.

60
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.570
Now, for the child, the child is going to be icon.

61
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.010
Bottom.

62
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:36.940
I can't wait to get fresh air which is going to leave this see for the icon is going to be icon which

63
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.220
at.

64
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.080
So it is going to be a cause.

65
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.140
The.

66
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.360
That's it.

67
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.370
This for a photo.

68
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.270
Okay.

69
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.430
I'll get you the cowboy attitude.

70
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.380
I get you.

71
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.920
Okay.

72
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.290
Whereby the need for the position was to tell how we are going to place that.

73
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.550
I can't on top of the circle of Avatar.

74
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.770
So are going to say that we want it to be minus two.

75
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.020
So it's going to be bottom.

76
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.980
But of those ten.

77
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.160
So we'll this then there's going to be left of it.

78
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.860
Okay.

79
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.640
Now, I've tried this before, so it does.

80
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.560
I guess I'm going with this.

81
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.030
Okay.

82
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.920
No, that's okay.

83
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.490
Great.

84
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.400
You can see the way.

85
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.480
Right.

86
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.340
So it's up of the little future I could implement this or type of this is going to probably open the.

87
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.460
The model so used as I was able to choose either for picking from gallery or pick you from camera.

88
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.870
Okay.

89
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.850
Great.

90
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.840
Okay.

91
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.720
Okay, guys, see you in in this picture.
