00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.920
In this lecture, we're going to continue from where we stopped.

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.670
Now, over here, we're going to have the product name and we're going to have delete icon.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.270
Okay.

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.050
Now, to do this, we're going to need to go back to our visa code.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.440
Okay.

8
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.920
There are going to be doing this within the row, right?

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.340
Because we want it to be displayed horizontally.

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.200
That is from left to right.

11
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.590
Okay.

12
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.830
But before using their role within this rule writes regular first use a column widgets.

13
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.690
And the reason for this column widget is because over here we're going to have the price of the products.

14
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.100
Okay.

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.340
So now we can have the children.

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.630
And the first child is going to be a role.

17
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.980
Okay.

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.880
And also the children.

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.780
Now, what we can do is we can rob this collar widgets with a flexible widget so it takes the available

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.280
space.

21
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.459
We okay, now we can use culture and that's what we get.

22
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.560
And this is going to be flexible.

23
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.550
Flexible.

24
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay.

25
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770
Vice culture an associate.

26
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.680
Okay.

27
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.620
Now the first chart is going to be it says widgets, which is going to be the product name.

28
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.160
Okay.

29
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.150
For now, we can't say dad's name.

30
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.440
Okay.

31
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.320
Now we can give this some style.

32
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.570
It's going to be chest stye.

33
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.350
We can make this font size system.

34
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.960
We don't want it to be very big.

35
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.140
And we can't say fault tweets.

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.560
This can be for tweets that the use isn't read or for all.

37
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.380
You can just go for 500 to be that bold.

38
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.440
Okay, now use culture and that's to save.

39
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.950
Okay.

40
00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.790
Go check it out.

41
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.560
Okay.

42
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.710
Like.

43
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.210
I see.

44
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.330
He's too close to this image.

45
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.150
So what we can do is play it right.

46
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.560
We're going to use the size box, property sized box, and so going to be given the space.

47
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.040
I recently said it's going to be weeks of ten.

48
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.490
Okay.

49
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.150
Is control necessary now and go check it out.

50
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.340
Okay, great.

51
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.370
Now we can have the other widget.

52
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.780
So they had a true cover.

53
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.400
And.

54
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.430
We can just use an equal civic to the billboards because as well as Flutter has this widget known as

55
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.590
icon in.

56
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.780
I can't.

57
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.500
But then as well you can see the stakes and your press.

58
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.280
We can't just leave this empty for now.

59
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.630
Okay.

60
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.280
And for the icon, it's going to be the icon, which adds.

61
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.680
So icons.

62
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.250
Darts.

63
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.020
The elites.

64
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.560
The dates.

65
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.930
Okay.

66
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.820
How did trachoma.

67
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.010
How did you come here?

68
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.530
How did you cover in this culture?

69
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.970
And that's the.

70
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.690
Okay.

71
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.040
Now.

72
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.640
Go check it out.

73
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.030
Okay.

74
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.370
Now we can change the color of this icon.

75
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.590
So this icon, which acts as a property known as color, we can see colors that red.

76
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.990
Okay.

77
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.570
And this controller and this to save.

78
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.490
Okay.

79
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.610
Now, what you're going to need to do next is we're going to take this icon.

80
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.850
So the right side, I believe you know how to do this, right?

81
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.210
Okay.

82
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.240
So to do this, we're going to go to the row and we can see main axis elements.

83
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.640
Main axis elements.

84
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.720
Dot space between.

85
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.260
Okay.

86
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.360
Okay.

87
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.290
You're going to see that the right side now.

88
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.790
Okay, great.

89
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.770
Now I stop using this icon.

90
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.460
We can get rid of this and use the icon.

91
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.880
Cupertino.

92
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.120
I can.

93
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.060
Dodds, I think.

94
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.990
Is that lone wolf?

95
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.520
Okay, that's not, like, remote.

96
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.350
What we have is deletes.

97
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.520
They need.

98
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.580
Okay, let's take this to the solid and see.

99
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.750
I like.

100
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.050
Okay.

101
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.760
I think we just have to delete.

102
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.960
Delete left.

103
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.860
Okay.

104
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.520
Let's see.

105
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.920
Okay.

106
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.220
I think this is.

107
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.760
Acceptable.

108
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.600
Yeah.

109
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.380
So.

110
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.470
Okay.

111
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.640
Now, what you can do is we can just wrap this with the pardon.

112
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.020
Wrap with how there is going to be.

113
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.640
You can't say only wants to take this only from the top four will be ten.

114
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.950
Okay.

115
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.090
Okay.

116
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.690
Great.

117
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.070
Okay.

118
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.430
Now, the reason for this column is because we are going to have the price displayed over here.

119
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.670
Right.

120
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.020
Okay.

121
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.050
Okay, guys.

122
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.770
See, Dennis, they.
