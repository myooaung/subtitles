00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.560
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.800
Now, what we're going to be doing, this lecture is over here.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.080
Have an icon widget.

5
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.710
And over here, we're going to have the song name widget.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.340
Okay, now, to do this, we're gonna need to go back to.

7
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.100
We call it.

8
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.640
Okay.

9
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.610
Now, in my splenic, Sean, you can see both widgets are going to be displayed horizontally.

10
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.330
So for this, we're going to be needing what's a row widget, and we're going to have this row widget

11
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.080
right after the test because we want it to go right under the cover test widget.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.500
Okay.

13
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.920
So over here, we can then have a row.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.190
And as you know, you can take multiple widgets.

15
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.350
So it's ask the children and the first child is going to be an icon, widgets.

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.900
And they're just going to say icons.

17
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.410
That's.

18
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.140
Music.

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.720
Music on the score notes.

20
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.730
Okay.

21
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.340
And we can give his size to this.

22
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.000
This is going to be the size of 15.

23
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.860
Is your contract necessary?

24
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.880
And go check it out.

25
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.980
You're going to sit over here and we can make sure the color is white.

26
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.510
You can see the icons, the icon widget as a property known as color.

27
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.790
So colors the whites.

28
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.590
Okay.

29
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.220
Is controlling the save.

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.050
And we can audit trail commerce as well.

31
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.740
Okay.

32
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.930
Okay.

33
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.700
Okay, okay.

34
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.590
And now we can then have the other widget.

35
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.550
Okay.

36
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.350
There's going to be test widget, right?

37
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.660
And is he just going to say some name and we can give some cited is and the test.

38
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.330
We can just say font.

39
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.820
Size to be 15.

40
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.430
We don't want it to be that big and it can't just make sure the color is colors that white.

41
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.840
And is controlling this to safe and.

42
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.510
Go check it out.

43
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.360
You can see it over here.

44
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.440
Okay.

45
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.210
Now what we need to do.

46
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.550
Of others rule.

47
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.380
We can then take this to the center, to the bottom.

48
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.669
Okay.

49
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:17.070
So over this roll through has a property known as cross us alignment and we can see cross us alignment

50
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.390
dots.

51
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.730
And this is going to take it to the hand vertically.

52
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.600
That is basically what's to cross us is alignment doors for the rail is not going to affect it vertically.

53
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.890
Okay.

54
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.080
Like you can see now as well.

55
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.740
We can see.

56
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.510
Man.

57
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.240
Men's size.

58
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.800
Man sighs.

59
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.210
It is good to see what this does to mass.

60
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.990
Okay.

61
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.420
Okay.

62
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.280
Really does nothing much to almost that had them much.

63
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.040
Then we're going to see what it does.

64
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.730
Akiko see.

65
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.450
You can see, basically, we can screw horizontally.

66
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.500
Now what we can do is within.

67
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.120
This this page read it better it's as something less cruel direction and we can see assess.

68
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.890
Aziz.

69
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.680
Aziz.

70
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.330
Aziz.

71
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.900
Aziz.

72
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.580
That's vertical.

73
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.460
You can see a lot of my year is in the go for the vertical.

74
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.470
Okay.

75
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.730
US.

76
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.520
Is that war?

77
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.330
No.

78
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.600
In the US.

79
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.900
Is that Vertica?

80
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.020
Okay.

81
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.380
This comes as the province is cruel, so it is not cruel behavior.

82
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.610
Russell Crowe directions.

83
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.890
So for that and.

84
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.380
You can see.

85
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.280
Okay, there's no way for this.

86
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.370
And you can see now you can see it's endless.

87
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.580
So you can just see the item blue there.

88
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.490
So we depend.

89
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.650
You also has a property known as item count and we can just see two for now.

90
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.830
And as well it has the controller property and it's going to be page.

91
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.570
Page controller and we can set the initial stage.

92
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.120
That is the first we do.

93
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.420
This is going to zero.

94
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.730
This is going to start form the first video you can associate to.

95
00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.029
She's going to start from the in the battle video.

96
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.840
You can also say five is going to start from the number five video.

97
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.480
Okay.

98
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.830
And lastly, we can say viewport friction.

99
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.420
So when and where additional command and control are necessary.

100
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.480
Okay.

101
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.000
Okay.

102
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.450
Okay.

103
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.200
Okay.

104
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.950
Okay.

105
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.300
One to Syria.

106
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.710
You can see we have just Syria.

107
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.430
Okay, guys.

108
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.780
So in Essex, we're going to start building the things we need over.
