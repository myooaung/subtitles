00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.830
In this lecture, we're going to call that all this field scene map.

4
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.120
Now, what is a map?

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.130
A map is simply an object.

6
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.090
And what is an object?

7
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.490
And object is something that basically has a property name and a property value, more like key values

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.240
pairs.

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.680
Okay, so now what we need to do is to convert all this towards a map next, of course, that's in the

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.310
same map.

11
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.590
What we could have done this over this upload video, we can just go right and say Firebase.

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.600
I think we call that Firebase.

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.340
Okay, I'm just going to check that.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.930
I think we have that in the.

15
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.400
Okay, Firebase.

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.730
What?

17
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.370
Can we call this fire store?

18
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.850
I think that that's collection and we can then say videos, right.

19
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.830
And then dot stock and we can just pass them to random for now.

20
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.050
And the condensed dot set.

21
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.780
Right now.

22
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.680
This is a fad.

23
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.720
So what's an object?

24
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.960
So you can see the value the property name is going to be Tom.

25
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.060
Tom May and the.

26
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.820
Value.

27
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.780
It's going to be this.

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.260
Okay.

29
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.260
Right.

30
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.560
And so on.

31
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.990
So we need to have this.

32
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.690
And the comma and so on.

33
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.990
Right.

34
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.590
Okay.

35
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, if we should if we if we do it this way, that's means there is no need for the MVC pattern.

36
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.550
Right.

37
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.900
Okay.

38
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.230
So that's what we're going to do.

39
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.330
It's in the models directory and then the video.

40
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.320
Okay.

41
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.900
So now all we can do is.

42
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.770
Over here.

43
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.380
Okay.

44
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.590
Within the class, we can create a map.

45
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.750
A map of strange.

46
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.760
And dynamic.

47
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.770
Right.

48
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.130
And now we can then say to Jason.

49
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.140
Okay to JSON and we can then use an arrow function for this.

50
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.080
We basically want to go that to all this field scene map.

51
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.650
Right.

52
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.010
Okay.

53
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.810
And I think we need to.

54
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.380
Okay.

55
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.100
Now the first field is going to be the user name before then.

56
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.430
I think this is also going to be a number.

57
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.080
So definitely is an eight.

58
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.150
We can just get rid of the finer.

59
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.620
Get rid of this.

60
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.060
Okay.

61
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.650
Get with.

62
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.480
Get grilled.

63
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.250
Get grilled.

64
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.180
Get real.

65
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.690
Go through and.

66
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.460
Get rid.

67
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.380
And I think we also have it in the sub.

68
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.430
Okay.

69
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.840
Okay.

70
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.090
And this is going to be what's user name attached.

71
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.960
And so we need this.

72
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.220
And this is going to be what this is going to be the already.

73
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.410
And you already.

74
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.590
Right.

75
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.000
And this is going to be the.

76
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.490
The Heidi.

77
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.410
And I'd.

78
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.260
Likes.

79
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.090
Likes.

80
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.340
And.

81
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.420
Okay.

82
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.960
Idea.

83
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.560
Okay.

84
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.980
Correct.

85
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.750
And comment.

86
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.890
Counts.

87
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.950
Comment.

88
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.220
Count.

89
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.660
Okay.

90
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.540
This shell counts.

91
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.840
Share counts and song name.

92
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.770
Sorry.

93
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.170
Okay.

94
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.950
Song.

95
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.720
Name.

96
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.150
Okay.

97
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.940
This is going to be what?

98
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.970
Caption.

99
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.960
And cop shows.

100
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.310
Okay.

101
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.020
And.

102
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.610
And video your real.

103
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.029
There's been a video.

104
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.540
Yara.

105
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.080
Wikipedia URL.

106
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.780
Okay.

107
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.590
Video.

108
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.980
I think we just have to copy.

109
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.340
Okay.

110
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.630
There is no issue.

111
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.070
And.

112
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.490
Some.

113
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.310
No.

114
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.410
Tom.

115
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.570
Thumbnail.

116
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.130
Okay.

117
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.310
And lastly, the pro profile.

118
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.590
Photo.

119
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.110
Q photo and profile.

120
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.690
Photo.

121
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.310
Okay.

122
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.750
So orders are filled to squads map.

123
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.230
They're coming from Python or I think JavaScript.

124
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.190
So Python in python is referred to as a dictionary.

125
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.850
Right.

126
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.560
Then I tick in sync and JavaScript is referred to as objects.

127
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.470
So objects is basically something that has.

128
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.130
Property value.

129
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.550
So your property name, this is the property name, right?

130
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.720
And this is the value.

131
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.870
So you can see this as a variable holding this.

132
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.450
Right.

133
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.250
So in flutter it is referred to as map in JavaScript.

134
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.670
It is known as objects and in Python is known as dictionary.

135
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.150
Okay.

136
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.490
So this is bismuth.

137
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.720
Right.

138
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.110
Okay.

139
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.740
And now we can use control and this to save this.

140
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.210
Okay.

141
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.860
Okay, guys, see you in investiture.
