00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.430
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.470
In the last lecture, we uploaded just two product images, but we got multiple images.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.620
Right now, the reason for the error is this.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.580
You can see over here what we are simply saying is once the data has been successfully uploaded with

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.810
all these fields, we then want to set back the image list to empty.

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.090
And also we want to change the subcategory list to empty.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.830
And also we want to reset the main category value to the default, which says select main category.

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.780
Now what we also have to do is to reset the uploaded images URL.

10
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.070
So to do that we have to say image, you are hell.

11
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.430
He made you our hell.

12
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.880
You have hell list.

13
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:10.120
And we have to set this back to empty or else it's going to still pick from the previous uploaded images

14
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.880
and still upload for this new product.

15
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.670
And this is basically it.

16
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.230
And all you just have to do is to halt restart this.

17
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.220
Hot restarts and it's going to take some time to hot with that.

18
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.280
You just have to wait for the process.

19
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.590
Okay.

20
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.870
And definitely we have to re log in and it's going to hurt.

21
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.210
We start this and now we have to re log in.

22
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.420
I'm going to re log into my store, famous store and the password MSI and log in.

23
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.350
Okay.

24
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.510
And upload products and.

25
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.780
For the main category men and for the subcategory.

26
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.550
I'm going to say jacket and I'm going to pull multiple images.

27
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.070
I'm just going to upload this to jackets.

28
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:19.700
And select and for the price, I'm going to say on a dollar and for the quantity we have 50 and for

29
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:30.290
the product name I can say jackets and for the product description I can then say bear sell jacket or

30
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.470
Jack is going to click on upload.

31
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.660
Okay.

32
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.340
Okay.

33
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.990
We just have to wait for this a bit and go check what is going on in your terminar hat sports.

34
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.570
And still uploading.

35
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.230
I think I have a bit of slow network still uploaded and it's done.

36
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.040
It has to look great.

37
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.650
And now you can see we have two documents now.

38
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.900
And this is the first image.

39
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.130
The first products we uploaded and check.

40
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.520
Okay, great.

41
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.740
You can see now we have just two product images which we applaud.

42
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.760
You can just open this in a new tab and see if it is correct.

43
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.590
It's true and a true copy.

44
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.320
Sorry to alight and controversy to copy and paste this.

45
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.670
To see if it is correct.

46
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.460
Okay.

47
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.730
You can see it's correct.

48
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.240
And we can just try to upload another image, to be sure, another product.

49
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.580
So be sure we don't we do not have any errors.

50
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.290
Okay.

51
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:53.190
For this category, it's going to be maybe shoes and for this subcategory.

52
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.910
Okay.

53
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.240
We do not have any category for that.

54
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.460
I'm just going to go in, man, again.

55
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.780
And.

56
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.070
And maybe shares in the future we will upload re products.

57
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.810
Okay.

58
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.420
Maybe I'm just gonna go with this.

59
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.410
And me.

60
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.320
Okay.

61
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.440
And for the price is going to be 60.

62
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.340
And for quantity, it's going to be 60.

63
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.710
And for product name, we can then say shot.

64
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.770
Okay.

65
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.790
And it's going to type something gibberish.

66
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.020
Okay.

67
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.900
Applaud.

68
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.500
And you can see currently we have to document so we are expecting the said to make its three documents.

69
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.060
Okay.

70
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.840
We just have to wait.

71
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.210
Okay.

72
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.820
I think over.

73
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.310
I saw it.

74
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.850
I saw it.

75
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.760
I think that.

76
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.440
Yeah.

77
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.240
We have two images.

78
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.760
And we have to images.

79
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.040
Okay.

80
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.410
Okay.

81
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.560
This is the one we recently uploaded, right?

82
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.110
Best selling, Jack.

83
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.750
Okay.

84
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.870
And I think we caught something short.

85
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.610
Or maybe it is.

86
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.450
Okay.

87
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.740
Okay.

88
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.760
Jacket.

89
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.510
And this was the first.

90
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.400
Okay, we can just delete this delete document.

91
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.140
Delete.

92
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.390
Okay.

93
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.930
We can just upload another to be sure we are not having any errors.

94
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.220
Okay.

95
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.500
Men and.

96
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.580
--.

97
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.850
Maybe under a dollar and four C and I'm just going to type something gibberish.

98
00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.940
Like I said, in the future we will upload our products and I'm just going to pick this to this and

99
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.830
me and.

100
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.650
Plourde.

101
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.750
Okay.

102
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:17.480
We just have to wait for this a bit and currently we have to comment and we are expecting that said

103
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.440
document.

104
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.000
Okay.

105
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.320
I think this is taking longer.

106
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.000
Okay.

107
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.930
I caught you.

108
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.430
Burke Sims could walk in as expected.

109
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.570
What we can just do at this field and use control in a contingency and C and over here to see.

110
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.940
Okay.

111
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.020
Oh, I think it beats awesome.

112
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.750
Okay.

113
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.420
Sounds good.

114
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.240
No errors.

115
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.230
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
