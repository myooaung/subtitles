00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.900
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.800
In this lecture, we're going to be able to, like, comments.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.430
Okay, then let's do this.

5
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.910
We need to go back to obvious awkward and then the controllers territory and then the comment and the

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.960
SQL controller fi.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.660
And now we can use controller and beats and make this work.

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.080
Okay, now over here, we're going to need to create a function and we're going to call this function

9
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.560
like comments within the parenthesis.

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.630
We're going to pass in a dynamic rainbow.

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.990
We struggle to call a heidi hand because specify the type of variable that it is a different type of

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.910
string and over.

13
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.280
Yet we can add this we're going to be using the weight and another T is the weight we need to use the

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.780
async over here.

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.940
Okay, great.

16
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.730
Now the reason for this idea is because whenever we call this like commit function, we want to be able

17
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.810
to pass a value to this variable called Heidi the K great.

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.640
Now the next step is what we're going to need to do is we're going to first check if the user as already

19
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.030
liked the comments at to check we're going to check based on the user uid.

20
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.090
Okay.

21
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.030
Not to do this.

22
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.400
What we can do is over here we can create a variable.

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.620
It's we're going to call this variable uid then it's going to be equal to the auto controller class.

24
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.780
We should send before all controller and we can see that user and uid.

25
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.240
And we can add an object to this.

26
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.960
Now, the user we are afraid to is user we have over here.

27
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.790
Okay, great.

28
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.070
Now, if for any reason you don't have it, you can basically just pause the video and had this.

29
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.730
Okay, like a super.

30
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.480
Yeah, we have a variable called or the score user and we cannot have access to this variable because

31
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.810
it is a private variable as we cannot access as variable outside this fly.

32
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.440
So what we simply did was to create a private variable called user and we are having access to this

33
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.470
user and we are saying dots value.

34
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.540
So everything we have over here is equal to this user.

35
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.729
Okay, great.

36
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.820
So if for any reason you did have this, you can basically just had this now.

37
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.420
And we can go back to this.

38
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.620
Okay, great.

39
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.850
Now, the next thing is to fetch the comments or have access to the comments fields.

40
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.180
That is why this feels okay not to do this.

41
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.790
I just want to specify it is a type of document snapshot because we are only going to be able to like

42
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.350
just comments like this, this we are not liking this and automatically like, all right, so we're

43
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.330
just going to like each comment.

44
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.170
Okay.

45
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.310
And over here we can call this doc and it's going to be a quarter to eight and fire.

46
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.850
For our store.

47
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.270
Faster debt collection.

48
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.690
In order to have access to the comments, we first need to pass through the evidence collection.

49
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.120
And to Pastor Darrell.

50
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.850
And that group is post I.D., right?

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.880
And now we can associate collection again.

52
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.860
And it's going to be for the comments.

53
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.110
And in that to us as each duck that is is comments, we can just say ID this I.D. and for the now,

54
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.480
we don't have anybody do it.

55
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.840
Whenever I call this like comments, we're going to pass a value to it.

56
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.880
And the value we can then say.

57
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.400
DOT gets the K grades.

58
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.640
Okay.

59
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.650
Now the nesting is to check.

60
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.870
To check if the user has liked the comments or not.

61
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.380
Not to do that, we're going to need that statement of here so we can say if doc, we can just add another

62
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.930
parenthesis and see if Doc.

63
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.720
DOT data.

64
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.900
We need to convey this to us dynamic.

65
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:10.430
And how this likes writes me about this variable doc is a variable that has access to all our comments

66
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:20.060
fields such as the comment itself that they publish the ID lies four or five footsie and others write.

67
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.959
So we can see.

68
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.100
If the like sorry we are having access to the lights and we can then see doors.

69
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.190
Contains.

70
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.010
You can see we can't actually key to that.

71
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.820
We can just grade that contains the unity that is the UID of the user.

72
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.170
Okay.

73
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.130
If it contains the UI of the user, it means the user as already liked that comment.

74
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.710
Right.

75
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.080
Okay.

76
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.970
So all we can do is we can say faster.

77
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.260
First or.

78
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.390
Darts collection.

79
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.640
And as for videos.

80
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.630
And dark.

81
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.840
This car post I.D..

82
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.620
And as were thoughts collection.

83
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.740
Comments.

84
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.760
And Dot.

85
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.310
Duck.

86
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.610
I do.

87
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.230
And now we can.

88
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.320
Nancy.

89
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.540
Dots of dates, right.

90
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.070
Okay.

91
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.790
That's a date.

92
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.650
We can't just use this.

93
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.600
And how the cynical view.

94
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.120
Okay.

95
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.370
Now we can of dates that likes fields to say field.

96
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.860
Field.

97
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.970
Field.

98
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.100
Field Value Duds.

99
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.150
Hurray!

100
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.770
Remove ads.

101
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.390
We want to remove the UID.

102
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.450
Okay.

103
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.940
Great.

104
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.840
So I think this is going to be at least.

105
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.220
Right.

106
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.430
Okay.

107
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.550
So we need to round this meeting at least, and I think we basically need that by day.

108
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.750
Okay, great.

109
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.850
Now, what we simply doing is over here, we created a duck rainbow.

110
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.680
Oh, he created the rainbow card duck.

111
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.390
And we are simply having access to our comments collection.

112
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.290
Right.

113
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.310
Remember, his comment collection is inside the videos collection.

114
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.900
Within the videos collection.

115
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.080
There is a breach called the unity.

116
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.780
And in that, in order to sell this collection, we first need to pass through all those obstacles,

117
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.630
such as the videos, the group.

118
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.810
That is the idea which I have shown you before and the comments.

119
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:49.110
And now we assess each stock, each document that is each comment and the recipe gets in it.

120
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.160
So now this rainbow has access to all these views.

121
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.450
And over here we are saying, Doc, the data is dynamic.

122
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:03.930
We assess and he likes the likes property within the comments and we are see if it contains the uid

123
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.820
it's mes that's the yardi the users already liked.

124
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.560
So what we are simply doing is we are detained.

125
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.690
That's comments collection.

126
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.100
And you can see over here we are calling the flags, we are removing the UID.

127
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.270
Removing the UID means the user is not liked.

128
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.940
That is no longer like in the comments.

129
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.800
Again, like you can just going to see this.

130
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.760
Okay.

131
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.280
So all we can do now is s.

132
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.090
Else else.

133
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.350
Else we can then see if we can just basically copy this or go do this again.

134
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.010
It is a firebase so fast or.

135
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.080
Dutch collection.

136
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.970
Videos.

137
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.790
The White Dirt Duck.

138
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.750
That's called post I.D. and collection.

139
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.330
Comments.

140
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.290
Comments and thought what the doc.

141
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.400
I'd.

142
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.670
Right.

143
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.950
And as well a lot of dates.

144
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.570
Okay as well wants updated likes field.

145
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.090
But this time around are in the same field.

146
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.040
Value.

147
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.350
But what Harry had.

148
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.050
And it is released.

149
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
So we need to see your I.D..

150
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.780
Okay.

151
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.430
Great.

152
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.169
So you can just basically see these assets all go.

153
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.100
So over here we okay?

154
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.409
I think we need a surveyor.

155
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.120
Surveyor?

156
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.780
We are simply saying if the user liked the.

157
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.470
As like the comments before by clicking on this we want to like.

158
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.520
Right.

159
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.070
So now like that's me.

160
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.930
We don't longer have the user uid again.

161
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.140
LS this open?

162
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.750
You understand?

163
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.130
So this is the opposite of this.

164
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.770
We are adding and removing it adding remove it added removing had added removing.

165
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.740
Okay.

166
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.440
Okay, now we can try this out.

167
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.930
We're gonna need to go back to the.

168
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.760
Comment screen.

169
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.820
And we already have access to the comment controller over here.

170
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:17.900
You can see.

171
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.670
And within the like.

172
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.380
It is the view now of others.

173
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.270
I can't.

174
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.840
We need to rob this with the button.

175
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.210
So control dots are output.

176
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.050
Widgets are going to rob this with a button type of equal.

177
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.650
Remember we have different type of button type.

178
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.640
You can as well go with the gesture detector.

179
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.400
So as you know, we have the on tap.

180
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.410
Like we can just use it for a narrow function for this and call the comment controller.

181
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.380
Comment controller, comment controller and say darts.

182
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.060
The what like comments.

183
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.450
Okay.

184
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.410
And the ID is what?

185
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.300
The comments.

186
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.690
The art.

187
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.490
I you can just check what this what their offense has committed to it.

188
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.440
If you forgot it.

189
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.570
And now we can just all three studies.

190
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.520
And see.

191
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.720
Okay.

192
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.590
Okay.

193
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.140
Okay.

194
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:23.830
And.

195
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.230
If we start.

196
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.920
Okay.

197
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.420
Feminazi start and we can check this out.

198
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.970
As well.

199
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.380
We can take our time in our.

200
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.360
Hopefully there is not going to be anywhere else.

201
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.300
Okay.

202
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.290
Okay.

203
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.220
Now we can.

204
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.440
Click on this comment.

205
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.620
Kirkland is.

206
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.080
Okay.

207
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.550
Now let's try to see.

208
00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.570
Okay.

209
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.300
I think.

210
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.090
Okay, you can see over here we have one likes.

211
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.100
Okay, now this is zero.

212
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.570
Click on.

213
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.290
This is going to be wide.

214
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.130
Okay.

215
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.670
Now let's check our database to see.

216
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:24.010
Looks like all we can do is we can't go back to the weeds collection.

217
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.730
And hopefully we are currently in the right.

218
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.360
Okay.

219
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.410
Okay.

220
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.810
We can't because I don't really know the comment.

221
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.260
We're.

222
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.250
Like this, like the first one.

223
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.120
Okay.

224
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.670
Okay.

225
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.180
Great.

226
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.610
Now you can see the unity.

227
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.610
Okay.

228
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.260
Okay.

229
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.170
He's working, right.

230
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.620
Okay.

231
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.050
Now, what we can also do is.

232
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.600
Over this cholera that is there fever.

233
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.760
You can see we have this icons of here right now.

234
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.140
We have this color, the red.

235
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.540
Now what we can do, we can call the comments.

236
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.150
The comments.

237
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.830
Dodds.

238
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:23.410
You can see the likes and dots contains if it contains the user you ID so you can and that's again user

239
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.970
ID you can see all the controller.

240
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.940
Your watch Dutch user ID.

241
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.540
And if it continues, sir, I think we need.

242
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.800
This does not check.

243
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.130
If it contains the user ID, it means the user asks current.

244
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.030
Right.

245
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.590
So want to show the red color.

246
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.700
Else who wants to say colors?

247
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.670
What?

248
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.530
Okay.

249
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.180
Now he's comptroller at the FCC.

250
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.080
Okay.

251
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.580
And you can see we have key.

252
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.600
Okay.

253
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.510
This as.

254
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.550
Okay, let's do this.

255
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:01.870
Okay.

256
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.000
What?

257
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.680
We can just do this all at the start.

258
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.970
So if these are your idea is already there.

259
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.420
We just want to show read.

260
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.460
If not want to see.

261
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.260
We want it to be white.

262
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.070
Okay.

263
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.070
You can see.

264
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.610
Okay.

265
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.230
So therefore it is.

266
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.560
Should be what it should be.

267
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.130
White.

268
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.590
Again, you can see this has zero lives and it is white.

269
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.990
So maybe they will click on it by liking it.

270
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.400
It's not hard to read.

271
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.690
So you can see it has one like one like one like one black, one like.

272
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.450
Right as well.

273
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.490
You can like this, you can on like this you can see nine zero.

274
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.560
So when we click on this, the height, the authority of the user gets added.

275
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.390
So you can see this check to.

276
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.090
This should be the last.

277
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.380
You can see currently there is you already.

278
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.530
So when we will like.

279
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:07.420
Okay.

280
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.380
It's going to go off hopefully.

281
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.280
Probably didn't get updated with time like you can see is guard.

282
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.940
You can see.

283
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.610
So click on it again is going to get harder at.

284
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.320
Right.

285
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.580
Okay.

286
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.110
So does or does what they check?

287
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.240
Means over a year.

288
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.930
So we are simply checking if the user ID is there.

289
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.170
It's means the user has already liked that comment.

290
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.910
So we want to remove it.

291
00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:38.990
So by doing all this, we are able to like and like so you can see is of the it's in re time we check

292
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:45.770
over here you can see is gone and we currently of all right and do it again is going to come back to

293
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:53.270
this okay okay now if when there is a does still this time you can do what so let me know fully since

294
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.810
before I was available to.
