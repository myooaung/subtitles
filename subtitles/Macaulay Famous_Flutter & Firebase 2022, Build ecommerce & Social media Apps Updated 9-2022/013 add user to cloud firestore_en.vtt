00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.510
Our guys work here in this lecture, whereas we're going to see our data in the cloud for our database.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.420
So we are not just going to save our data over this authentication tab, but as well over here.

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.580
Okay.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
Now to do this, we going to need to go back to our visa code and then.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.220
After this we can just give some space.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.410
Does not really matter if we give space or not.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.800
Okay.

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.940
And what we can do is we can create a PayPal called user to store.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.180
This user credentials, you can just.

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.090
Copy and.

11
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.460
Is this that we can see a darts user as well.

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.870
It wants to specify the type of variable.

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.270
Most of the time you don't really need to specify the type.

14
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.780
It is the type of user and we can see the user can be.

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.860
Okay.

16
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.070
Now imagine while we are doing y, we said it's going to be.

17
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.670
Imagine if the user clicks on the login button.

18
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.310
Clicks on this button and then wins back is going to be all right.

19
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.680
Okay.

20
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.700
Okay.

21
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.320
So now we can save the user to the.

22
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.880
Cloud faster.

23
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.330
Okay.

24
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.290
Now, to do this, we're gonna need to do some check on.

25
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.620
The reason for this check is we don't want to save the user.

26
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.320
Any time the user clicks on this Google sign in, I think I've renamed my to Google sign and you can

27
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.960
easily just do that as well, or you can just go with the log.

28
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.460
Okay.

29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.740
Now, the reason we have to do this check, like I said, is we don't want to save the data whenever

30
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.050
the user clicks on this Google sign.

31
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.280
Right.

32
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.240
That is all the time.

33
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.210
We don't want to keep saving that user data all the time.

34
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.580
We just want to save it once.

35
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.480
Right?

36
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.870
Then imagine if the user should restart this app.

37
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.970
I think they're going to see this screen again.

38
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.330
Right.

39
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.810
And when they click on this, we don't want to save that user since we already have it because it has

40
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.890
a check record to give.

41
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.790
Okay.

42
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.180
So.

43
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.930
Well, yeah, we can say so if.

44
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.390
User.

45
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.620
Is not speaker.

46
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.780
First of all, we can check for us if it is not required to know which means the user.

47
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.540
Sorry.

48
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.530
Which means the user is logged in.

49
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.920
Right.

50
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.310
Or are successful, successfully signed in.

51
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.130
It is not a question that we can out of that.

52
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.060
If, again, we can say if you think I just.

53
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.190
If you are credentialed.

54
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.600
That's.

55
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.770
Adds user info then dots is new user.

56
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.060
We only want to save the user.

57
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.850
If it a new user it was already existing user then we don't want to save it with a new user.

58
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.810
Then we can then call the five days.

59
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.590
I think we have the fan base.

60
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.190
Okay.

61
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.440
So we also need to initialize that.

62
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.900
Okay.

63
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.820
I think I stole it.

64
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.740
I think it's known as quite fast.

65
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.340
Okay.

66
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.840
So we can see, find out.

67
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.530
We can just go ahead and specify is a type of five based faster and less core faster and it's going

68
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.930
to be equal to Firebase.

69
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.370
For us to.

70
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.080
So it's these tents and this.

71
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.780
Okay.

72
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.540
So if is an user then I can see on this curve have these.

73
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.120
Let's think fast.

74
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.400
It's.

75
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.480
Collection.

76
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.620
Okay.

77
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.100
Right.

78
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.360
Collection rights.

79
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.700
Okay.

80
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.630
You're going to call this users guides where all our users are going to be stored.

81
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.030
Okay.

82
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.170
And issues is going to be connected to this user's collection by what's something more?

83
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.710
That's it.

84
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.040
So this dock is referring to each user.

85
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.320
Right.

86
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.300
That is every single document or every single user.

87
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.830
Okay, now default.

88
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.270
Whenever a user creates an account, a uid is going to be automatically generated.

89
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.130
Right.

90
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.500
Okay.

91
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.510
So for the doc.

92
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.210
Then you're going to see a user that's already.

93
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.350
You say that you can see this available has access to this the case of the tide.

94
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.090
And we can then use a dotted and dots sets.

95
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.190
Okay.

96
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.220
Houses.

97
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.160
And now we can pass the fields we want.

98
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.710
Okay.

99
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.480
The first field is going to be user name and now we can see is going to be user.

100
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.280
The display name because that's what Google has.

101
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.060
Okay.

102
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.840
And the order is going to be the uid.

103
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.250
Well the user ID is going to be user that you already.

104
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.700
And as well.

105
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.890
We can get the profile photo.

106
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.960
All this are names associated.

107
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.780
The heat display name is a name associated to the Google accounts.

108
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.380
The your ID is your ID associated with the Google account as well.

109
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.730
Okay.

110
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.030
So I think I said it automatically generated.

111
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.900
No others are.

112
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.340
What are these fields associated to the Google accounts?

113
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.700
Okay.

114
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.310
Because there's also a profile for to.

115
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.140
Okay.

116
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.790
So it is going to be user.

117
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.100
That's 4542.

118
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.350
That is a profound for to associated.

119
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:39.050
To the your Google account, you can see profile photo URL, but we called our field four, five, four,

120
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.270
two.

121
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.690
Okay, great.

122
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.210
Great.

123
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.840
So this is basically it's you can delete this user and just retry.

124
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.160
Okay.

125
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.600
So it's going to look like this.

126
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.760
First of all, going to have a coalition of college users.

127
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.160
Right.

128
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.650
And.

129
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.970
Each user is going to be connected by something on that side.

130
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.920
Well, now we can just automatically generate and is going to be words username and is going to be the

131
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.760
user name associated to the Google accounts.

132
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.720
And we can had.

133
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.660
More field.

134
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.410
Right.

135
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:26.450
Like the other is your ID and you can just have some to give and you can add as many as your okay.

136
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.760
So that's simply it's okay.

137
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.710
Now all you're going to need to do is to.

138
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.290
Delete this user.

139
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.950
Delete.

140
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.420
So.

141
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.590
But via the elite accounts not the okay delete this user.

142
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.240
This my email address.

143
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.500
You can basically contact me.

144
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.360
It's my quality was achieved.

145
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.100
Okay.

146
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.750
I think mail internet is not connected, but you can just delete this and.

147
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.710
We try.

148
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.420
Okay.

149
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.710
So delay this and then click on this.

150
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.880
You know, that's a try.

151
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.350
Okay.

152
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.750
Definitely is going to work out.

153
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.350
The cabinet is going to which I'm just going to wait for this or do this.

154
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.400
You can basically do this yourself and you're going to see the outcome is going to work as planned.

155
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.730
Okay.

156
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.380
Well, first of all, check in if the user is not know to make sure the user as correctly signed in.

157
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.480
Then over here we are checking if the user is a new user.

158
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.130
If if it is not the user, then it's means we already have that user.

159
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.020
So whenever user clicks on this, we don't want to just keep adding like you can see.

160
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.520
This is the model I serve to talk about and.

161
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.340
So we don't want to keep adding that user to our database.

162
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:56.190
So only add in the user if it is not a new user can see if it is in use.

163
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.990
That's only when we want to have it.

164
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:05.400
So if it is a user, does Hulu one wants or had all this data and all this data from the Google account

165
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.350
so you can see the user, the display name, it is the display name associated to the Google accounts.

166
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.430
And the idea as well is is the UID associated to the Google account?

167
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.350
And over here is the photo you have attached to the Google account as well.

168
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.290
The way we are simply saving, it's okay.

169
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.970
Probably I got an error and I can just check this.

170
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:30.990
Okay.

171
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.590
You can see.

172
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.789
You can see now this is my email address.

173
00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.870
My colleague Shimonoseki in catastrophe trade.

174
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.010
And let's see if we have it away.

175
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.530
And of back to the speech.

176
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.140
Look, you can see.

177
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.970
You can see now.

178
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.180
You can see this check for the UID.

179
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.600
