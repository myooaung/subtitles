00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.660
Our guys walk home in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.410
We are going to continue building the profile screen.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.109
Okay.

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.260
Now we're going to do this right after this row, but still within the column.

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.990
Okay.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.890
And what we can just do.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.020
We can create another row.

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.290
And as you know, the rule can take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed horizontally.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.240
And for the first side of the row, it's going to be a column widget.

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.440
Colon and children.

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.250
And the first child of the colon is going to be a test.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.420
And for now you're just going to say ten, ten and we can start this test.

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.090
Style.

14
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.630
Okay.

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.680
We can increase the font size to 20.

16
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.500
I think we need an addition.

17
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.220
Okay.

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.410
And also we can.

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.760
Cell phones, which.

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.380
Fonts width.

21
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.600
Got bored.

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.340
Okay.

23
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.790
Comer and within the role we can semi assess alignment may assess.

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.720
Men.

25
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.670
US's alignment top centre and newcomer use culture and save.

26
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.020
Okay.

27
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.730
And now we can have another test with that.

28
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.950
This is going to say following.

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.040
Following.

30
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.280
We could also study this and.

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.170
STI test sti.

32
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.750
Okay.

33
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.040
Fonts width.

34
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.400
Sorry, font size is going to be 20 as well.

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.060
And.

36
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.240
Can't wait.

37
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.320
Can't wait.

38
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.470
The board.

39
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.520
Okay.

40
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.150
This and use control necessary and go check it out.

41
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.470
Okay.

42
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.430
We also can just change the color to colors that maybe black.

43
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.130
And C is contrary necessary.

44
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.590
Okay.

45
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.630
We can see this maybe block 12 or something like that.

46
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.790
Okay.

47
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.050
So you can say it's okay.

48
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.410
We can just go with the white color for now and.

49
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.460
Sorry.

50
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.280
Okay.

51
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.610
And now what we can basically just do is to copy this column in terms of I have to look over and paste

52
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.210
this.

53
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.450
Okay.

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.990
You can try and save.

55
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.640
Okay.

56
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.900
Okay.

57
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.530
And now we can give space between this first column and the order by having a size box sized.

58
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.770
Sighs.

59
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.970
So.

60
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.160
Size box and we accumulate the space horizontally.

61
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.930
So this is going to be width of maybe ten.

62
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.700
And how do you to cover.

63
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.480
In the say.

64
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.760
Okay.

65
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.740
And lastly, we can.

66
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.890
Had it, you know, cover and paste this again.

67
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.960
We can just go ahead and hire out the size box.

68
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.560
Size box.

69
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.490
I think we give ten.

70
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.240
Okay.

71
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.910
Which is going to be ten.

72
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.180
And.

73
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.040
Okay.

74
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.760
This is going to say likes.

75
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.870
Okay.

76
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.610
Could.

77
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.000
You can see.

78
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.110
Looking great.
