00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.460
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.680
In this lecture, we're going to have some validation check for our image.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.410
And also we are going to be able to upload the image to the storage and the cloud faster database.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.100
To do this, we are going to go back to our VSD code and what we can do is before this always we can

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.780
just alight everything till this end and use control and see.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.360
And we're going to have another check.

8
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.230
Hopefully.

9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.480
Okay.

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.440
I think it's.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.610
Yeah.

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.580
Okay.

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.680
And we're going to have another check.

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.700
We can say if the image.

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.270
But this underscore image.

16
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.520
Then is not equal to.

17
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.070
No.

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.100
If it is not equal to null, then we want to do this.

19
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.690
Right.

20
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.350
Okay.

21
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.239
Else over here.

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.550
You can add on that as.

23
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.970
If the you are basically having to check the first check is if the form is valid.

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.230
And we're having that check again, if the image is not equal to know that if the user picked an image,

25
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.420
then only we want to do this.

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.640
So it has to pass through this to check the first check if if all the fields are valid, you can see

27
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.230
currently it is valid.

28
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.040
Right?

29
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.600
And the other check is if the image is not equal to no, that is if the user goes into the gallery.

30
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.510
Into the gallery and peek an image you can see currently it is not equal to nor.

31
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.930
Then only we want to do this else.

32
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.240
We want to return.

33
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.180
I think we have already created a snack bar.

34
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.010
Snack bar?

35
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.780
What did we call it?

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.800
Let's.

37
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.060
What's.

38
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.220
Hopefully I've forgotten what we call this.

39
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.270
Sure.

40
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.990
Snack or.

41
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.470
Snark, I think we call the snark.

42
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.830
Snack bar.

43
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.990
So I'm just going to check what we called.

44
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.230
That's.

45
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.080
I think we created a function somewhere.

46
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.330
Okay.

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm just going to have to get back to the customer and.

48
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.540
If you please feel small, empty.

49
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.230
And that is what I'm looking for.

50
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.540
Where did I create this?

51
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.740
Over.

52
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.160
Okay.

53
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.560
Sorry.

54
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.040
The customer log in screen.

55
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.980
We created it above here and we call this what we call this snack bar.

56
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.490
Not sure.

57
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.420
Snack bar.

58
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.650
Okay.

59
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.150
So we called it snack.

60
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.140
Snack bar.

61
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.340
Okay for the title.

62
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.990
It is a spec it says because we are specify it's going to be a string so you can say please pick.

63
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.950
Peak image.

64
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.040
Okay.

65
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.950
And of returning this.

66
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.830
Please do the right thing.

67
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.880
You can just return.

68
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.880
It's snack bar.

69
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.670
A snack bar.

70
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.940
Which is going to say please feels most.

71
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.590
Not be empty.

72
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.060
Okay, over here.

73
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.440
We need a semicolon.

74
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.270
Okay, great.

75
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.340
They use control necessary and add back to this.

76
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.310
Sign up sellers and click on this.

77
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.640
You can see, please feel small, not be empty.

78
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.910
Right.

79
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.800
Okay, great.

80
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.820
And what we can basically just do is we can just ask for support from this code.

81
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.070
MCKELVEY Yeah.

82
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.570
Where we have the upload image, the storage, we can copy this.

83
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.510
And back to the London customer screen.

84
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.790
So is London silver screen.

85
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.950
If you forgot.

86
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.480
Now we do that most of the time.

87
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.660
Definitely you you forget most of the things, but you have to go back to it again and we can just paste

88
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.990
this over here and we need to import.

89
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.180
Imports.

90
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.010
And look, we need to define this.

91
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.110
We need to also create a variable to store the storage because we are going to be uploading the photo

92
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.990
over the storage.

93
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.500
Right.

94
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.870
So we need to create a variable for that.

95
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.920
And over here.

96
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.390
You can then say finer and firebase.

97
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.430
Storage underscore private storage.

98
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.000
And this is going to be Firebase Storage.

99
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.750
Definitely you must have forgotten all distance, but you can just go back to it again.

100
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.850
It is no more.

101
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.700
Okay, great.

102
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.820
And the other thing we need is this.

103
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.350
Okay.

104
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.030
Okay, then copy this.

105
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.430
Pool via.

106
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.130
Okay.

107
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.230
Also this we need to I think we called this.

108
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.610
Remember we said the the name of the file that is the name of the image is going to be the user ID.

109
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.750
But what we can just do, we can say the name of the image is going to be the name of the the full name

110
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.710
of the user.

111
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.810
The full name of the user.

112
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.880
Okay, great.

113
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.880
And over here, we need to call this function, right?

114
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.960
And we're going to call this function before saving the data to the faster that is over here.

115
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.140
Right.

116
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.070
And.

117
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.700
We called House.

118
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.560
Underscore.

119
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.030
I think over.

120
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.210
Okay.

121
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.340
I think we need this.

122
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.080
Sorry.

123
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.840
Where is the image coming from?

124
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.880
I light.

125
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.360
Upload image.

126
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.810
Okay.

127
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.510
Sorry.

128
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.660
This is going to be the underscore image.

129
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.980
That is the part that is the image we are picking.

130
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.320
Right.

131
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.010
And use control necessary.

132
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.020
And lastly, we have to have another field over here.

133
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.340
Hopefully you understand all this, but you can just go back to it again and see.

134
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.630
I know.

135
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.110
Definitely you forget.

136
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.400
It is normal.

137
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.080
You don't have to feel bad.

138
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.380
The K and.

139
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.100
So we're going to call this field image.

140
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.780
And this is going to be what?

141
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.610
Download the URL.

142
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:38.210
WD r l oc remember the image is basically referring to the image with these is going to peak, right?

143
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.310
And that was why we have to pass it over.

144
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.610
Okay.

145
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.990
Hopefully understand this.

146
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.520
Okay.

147
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.100
And this country try to save.

148
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.910
Now what we can just do, we need to delete this collection because you can see this user does not have

149
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.750
an image.

150
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.450
Or won't have an image.

151
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.550
So, Celeste.

152
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.020
Okay.

153
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:11.400
Great collection has been deleted and we can then pick this image.

154
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.370
And I'm going to join Mark.

155
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.130
So, Joy.

156
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.800
Joyce tours.

157
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.070
And your store.

158
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.290
G.M..

159
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:36.000
That's calm and the password is going to be j, y and C.

160
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.630
Okay.

161
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.460
And since we do not have a loading spinner yet, we can just check the seminar to see what is going

162
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.150
on there.

163
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.300
Look, I think it has been created and we can hope to start this.

164
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.940
Once we start.

165
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.960
Or she starts.

166
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.950
Or she starts.

167
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.150
Or she starts.

168
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.640
And hopefully a new collection called Users has been created.

169
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.020
You can see this collection called Users and this.

170
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:18.830
And you can then see the image, the email, the address, the store, the store name and whatever storage.

171
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.690
There's good check storage.

172
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.500
Okay.

173
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.090
And see what's going on there.

174
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.650
Okay.

175
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.340
And profile pics.

176
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.520
Okay.

177
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.420
We have a little image, but this is the current one because we said the name of the image is going

178
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.670
to be the user name.

179
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.150
Okay.

180
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.270
Okay.

181
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.250
This is the.

182
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.680
My wife.

183
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.840
Okay.

184
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.630
Okay, guys.

185
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.260
See you in the next lecture.
