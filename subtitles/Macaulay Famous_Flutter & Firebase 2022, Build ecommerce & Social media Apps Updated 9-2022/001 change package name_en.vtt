Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:07.110
Now, do you remember during the process of integrated Firebase, we made our package name unique.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
But the problem is, this is not the only place where the package name is been used.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.830
So since we have changed it over here, we need to also change it in the rest of the FY.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.650
So in this lecture, that is what we're going to be doing.

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.040
Okay.

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.260
Now to change this package name, to use what we have over here, we need to go to the source.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.460
Source and debug.

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.240
I think we have it over here as well.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.220
The book and you can see or you can see it still has the example.

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.620
So what we can do is we can just copy this to make sure we don't have any has.

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.300
I'm trying to see.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.160
Okay.

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.820
And we can now get rid of this.

16
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.540
Get rid of this and paste and then use contra and say, okay, we've done for the the work.

17
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.520
We also have it in the main.

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.290
Main.

19
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.460
Got lean.

20
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.260
You can see with a bit of air.

21
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.920
Okay.

22
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.090
This is it as well.

23
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.130
We need to get rid of this.

24
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.350
And here's this.

25
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.330
And then use control and this to save.

26
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.030
As well.

27
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.800
We do have it in the race.

28
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.350
Okay.

29
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.130
This over here.

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.670
If you can see, we can then.

31
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.620
Okay.

32
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.290
You can share and save.

33
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.540
Okay.

34
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.400
I'm just going to make sure we don't have it somewhere else again, I think as well.

35
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.060
Profi.

36
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.540
Okay.

37
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.380
Okay.

38
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.050
Now we can then get rid of this.

39
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.900
And use control and this to save.

40
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.420
Okay.

41
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.870
Okay.

42
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.810
We had do it for we changed it for the bug.

43
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.310
You can see now it was calm example that some of this co had before.

44
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.300
Okay and as well we did for this.

45
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.000
I don't think we have it like that in Java.

46
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.890
Vicki Cassidy.

47
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.490
Okay.

48
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.870
We did for us as well.

49
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.420
And as all we did for.
