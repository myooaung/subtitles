00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.310
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.390
In this lecture, we are finally going to save the video to our cloud faster database.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.430
Okay, now, to do this, we're going to need to go to the controllers directory and then the upload

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.880
video.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.370
And now we can use controlled B to make this work.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.720
Okay, now over here, we first need to create a variable called video and we can specify the type of

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.130
variable this is a type of the video model and now we can see is equal to the video.

9
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.420
Okay.

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.440
Video, video like this.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.760
You can see it was us to pass the value to this.

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.310
Feels right.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.690
Okay.

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.980
Okay.

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.900
Now, the first shield is the user name, right?

16
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.240
And over here, we already fashioned the user name from the user collection.

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.620
Right.

18
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.830
Okay.

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.080
You can see we already fetch into the current logged in user.

20
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.070
Okay.

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
So over here we need to add the practices and then called.

22
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.580
I use a doc variable user doc and thoughts data.

23
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.790
And over.

24
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.850
Yeah, we can see it is a map.

25
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.770
Map of string and dynamic.

26
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.880
Die, not make it over here.

27
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.780
We need to dance a name.

28
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.310
I think that is what we have in our database.

29
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.390
And not a user name.

30
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.440
You can see name.

31
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.010
Okay.

32
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.420
Great.

33
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.850
Now the rest is already passed.

34
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.310
Okay.

35
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.110
For the.

36
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.910
For the Heidi is going to be video.

37
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.650
The deal and caucus needs.

38
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.240
The lens.

39
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.830
That is how many video we currently have.

40
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.070
If this is the first video that is going to see one.

41
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.630
As for the likes, we can just give an empty list for now and for the cow comments counts.

42
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.350
Defaults is going to be zero and for the share count as well is going to be zero.

43
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.400
Okay.

44
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.300
And.

45
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.600
Share counts.

46
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.110
Okay.

47
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.370
Okay.

48
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.110
For the profile photo, we are still going to get the profile photo from the users collection.

49
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.470
Right.

50
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.660
So as well, we need to have apprentices over here and then called the user doc and then those data

51
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.910
and now we can see as.

52
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.630
My shrink.

53
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.300
And die.

54
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.230
Die, not make it over here.

55
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.630
We need to demonstrate profi.

56
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.660
For to make sure you don't make any spelling mistakes, you're going to get a bad state error.

57
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.500
Okay.

58
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.160
Great.

59
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.440
And what we can do is we can have the train come out there.

60
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.100
Okay.

61
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.590
Now, after this.

62
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.670
Now we need to then.

63
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.170
With this and then faster.

64
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.880
The collection I think we have.

65
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.510
The that collection that we can call the collection videos.

66
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.700
So this is where all our videos are going to be stored and we can see the dog.

67
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.980
And as you know, each video is going to be collected.

68
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.850
So this video collection based on something known as the video.

69
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.240
Right.

70
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.630
Okay.

71
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.950
So for the video, we can save videos and.

72
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.850
Walcott's needs, the lines and how many video we have so far.

73
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.890
And then we can see set.

74
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.070
And now we can then call this variable called video.

75
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.100
Okay.

76
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.180
We can just make sure.

77
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.380
The deal.

78
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.940
Okay.

79
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.890
And we can see that's.

80
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.680
I think we do that to.

81
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.310
Jason.

82
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.760
Okay.

83
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.300
I think we are having.

84
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.850
Okay.

85
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.280
I'm just going to make sure.

86
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.960
The you.

87
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.330
Okay.

88
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.750
The sets.

89
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.680
The sets.

90
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.149
Okay.

91
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.730
Sorry.

92
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.899
We as well need to call this.

93
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.310
Okay.

94
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.920
Although it is okay.

95
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.760
Her, us.

96
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.820
And now we can't use control.

97
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.050
The think we in Australia is currently the case so.

98
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.290
And.

99
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.830
Right.

100
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.210
I think there's.

101
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.660
I think I don't really know how to spell video.

102
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.470
I'm just going to check for the spelling.

103
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.220
And I think.

104
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.740
This should be.

105
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.950
And.

106
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.240
We can just go with our spending over a year.

107
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.510
And get rid of the S and.

108
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.170
Okay.

109
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.270
Is Katrina necessary?

110
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.680
Okay.
