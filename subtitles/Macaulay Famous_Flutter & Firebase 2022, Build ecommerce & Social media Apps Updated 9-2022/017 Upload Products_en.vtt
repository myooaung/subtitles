00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.520
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.270
In this lecture, we're going to upload our products to the cloud faster database.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
To do this, we have to create a new function.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.510
Okay, over here.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.780
I'm going to say void, and we can call this function upload data.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.740
Okay.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.870
In the future, we're going to be using the A8 and in order to use the await, we have to use the async

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.920
over here.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.900
Okay.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:42.450
And now what we can do is before we can upload the products, we can make sure the product images has

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.790
already been uploaded to the Firebase Storage.

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.670
To do that, we're going to have some check over here.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.650
We can say if.

15
00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.700
If emerge u r l list dot is not empty.

16
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.910
If it is not empty, it means the product.

17
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.910
The product images has been successfully uploaded to the Firebase Storage.

18
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.780
If it is not empty, what we want to do is to upload the product right.

19
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.400
And in order to upload the product to this cloud store database, we have to use that package which

20
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.620
we had earlier installed long ago.

21
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.800
That is the cloud faster package.

22
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.130
So what we have to do first is to import it.

23
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.240
So over here we can just go ahead and say Finder and it is a type of firebase faster and we can call

24
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:52.660
this variable on the score faster is going to be equal to Firebase faster dot instance.

25
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.380
Okay.

26
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.350
Great.

27
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.270
And now we can then use that.

28
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.630
Okay.

29
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.750
Back to this.

30
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
And now we can say on the score faster.

31
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.520
Faster.

32
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.420
Dot words.

33
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.890
That collection, which is referring to the collections we have, how all our products are going to

34
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.730
be stored.

35
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.190
Okay.

36
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.020
We are going to call this collection products.

37
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.440
That is all our products.

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.180
All our uploaded products is going to be stored in this directory called products.

39
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.740
And as you know.

40
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.120
We have to refer to each product.

41
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.240
That is, each product is going to be connected to this product collection.

42
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.020
So we have to say dock, dock.

43
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.260
The dock is basically referring to the document that is the single product we are uploading to our database.

44
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.690
And this products is referring to where this document is going to be stored.

45
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.300
And remember, this document or this dock is basically referring to each single product.

46
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.390
We are pulled into the database.

47
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.080
Okay.

48
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.650
And.

49
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.000
Okay.

50
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:25.740
What we can just do is we can just stop here for now and we can specify the type of variable or the

51
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.480
type of value we want to store.

52
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.360
It is a type of something known as collection.

53
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.160
Collection with friends and.

54
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.610
E Or we can then call this viable product.

55
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.630
With that is the short form of product reference.

56
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.710
Okay.

57
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.560
And over here we can simply just say our weights and products ref.

58
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.860
And now we can see the dark.

59
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.270
That is the continuation of something like this.

60
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.640
Right.

61
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.830
So fully understand.

62
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.170
Okay.

63
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.540
And now we have to pass the name of each document.

64
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.100
Right.

65
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.800
But rather than passing names, we can just go ahead and leave it this way.

66
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.060
By leaving it this way, floater is going to automatically generate a unique document name for us.

67
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.510
Okay, so you can just go like this.

68
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.649
And now.

69
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.630
Sorry, get rid of that semicolon.

70
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.240
And now we can then say dot set.

71
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.620
The City Council is asking for the data.

72
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.660
It is a map.

73
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.180
This and this.

74
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.590
And now we is basically referring to the fields we want to store to our cloud faster database.

75
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.300
The first field is going to be the name of the category.

76
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.810
So we can say man category is going to be equal to men.

77
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.180
Category value.

78
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.140
Right.

79
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.890
Okay.

80
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.330
And.

81
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.450
The.

82
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.920
The sub category.

83
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.680
So category category is going to be equal to the sub category.

84
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.980
Category value.

85
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.030
And also we would like to store the price of the products.

86
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.790
This is going to say a price.

87
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.170
Prize.

88
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.260
Hopefully we have that and also we have to store.

89
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.630
How many?

90
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.700
How many products we have for that item so we can say in stock and this is going to be a core.

91
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.770
Quantity.

92
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.540
I think we do not have that.

93
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.050
Cookie quantity.

94
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.690
We do.

95
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.430
Okay.

96
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.140
And what we can also store is the product name.

97
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.060
And products.

98
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.220
Name.

99
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.620
Okay.

100
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.690
We also would like to store the product description.

101
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.170
You can just use a short form.

102
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.780
Most of the time you have to make things clear.

103
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.520
And products.

104
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.540
This Commission.

105
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.600
Okay.

106
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:24.140
We also can store maybe the UID of the user of the seller.

107
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.740
I think we call the seller uid is going to check this what we called it for the customer.

108
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.370
Sorry.

109
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.240
The seller's.

110
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.760
Okay.

111
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.640
Your ID.

112
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.930
And this has gotten from five base.

113
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.790
Faster.

114
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.810
You can just import it if you want to.

115
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.720
Firebase so far.

116
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.370
Discord's dot instance dot current user dot ui id via.

117
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.630
We need to know check.

118
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.970
Okay.

119
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.740
And what we can also store is the products images.

120
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.590
Right.

121
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.680
And this is going to be equal to image list.

122
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.350
So image your URL list.

123
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.020
Okay.

124
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.780
And.

125
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.480
We can also stall the discounts if the user is given discounts and defaults.

126
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.980
We're just going to set it to zero.

127
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:29.740
OC OC We want to save the main category the subcategory, the price, the product name, the product

128
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.750
description, the seller UI, the product images and the discounts.

129
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.170
Okay.

130
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.010
Sounds good.

131
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.760
Sims Good.

132
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.260
Sims Coach.

133
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.960
Sims good.

134
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.270
And what we can also do.

135
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.330
We have to get rid of this.

136
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.010
Why?

137
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.880
Okay.

138
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.410
I'm just going to get rid of this over here.

139
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.230
We basically do not need to print anything to ourselves.

140
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.690
I'm going to get rid of it.

141
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.130
And what we can do.

142
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.010
We have to get rid of this over a copy.

143
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.150
Your clipboard.

144
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.590
I'm going to show you why.

145
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.040
Because what we basically want to do is after.

146
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:14.220
And what we can just do is instead of upload called function upload products, we can call it upload

147
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.630
images.

148
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.010
Right.

149
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.140
And you're going to see why shortly.

150
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.100
And.

151
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.330
Over year.

152
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.600
We can then say thoughts went complete.

153
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:34.620
That is after uploading this item or this fields to the cloud faster database.

154
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.350
We want to do something.

155
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:37.549
Okay?

156
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:45.050
And now we can place the set state and you can see what we are basically doing is we are resetting the

157
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.130
image list.

158
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.210
Right.

159
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.170
And we are clearing the entire form.

160
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.650
And what we can also do.

161
00:08:53.650 --> 00:09:01.600
We can reset the subcategory list, subcategory list and say we want it to be empty.

162
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:11.800
And also we can reset the main category of value and set it back to the default.

163
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.240
I think the default we just have to have the semicolon first.

164
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.670
I think the difference is select main category.

165
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:22.940
Okay.

166
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.010
Back to.

167
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.140
Okay.

168
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.290
Is this over yet?

169
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.000
Okay.

170
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:36.600
And that's this basically it's and now how do we call this function?

171
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:37.770
Right.

172
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.420
So what we can then do is we can create a new function.

173
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.160
We can then create a new function void.

174
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.060
And we're going to call this function now upload product.

175
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.750
And we're going to be using the weight and that is the weight we need to think of.

176
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:03.620
So what we can do, we can then say our weight and we can call this function first.

177
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.570
This upload images.

178
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.900
And you can see over here what you are basically saying in this function, if the main category is not

179
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:19.580
equal to the select main category, it means the user successfully choose a category, right?

180
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:27.350
So if it is not equal to this category and the category is not equal to subcategory, it means the user

181
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.570
has successfully choose a category.

182
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.550
And if the form is valid, we first want to save the firm.

183
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.480
And also we are checking if the image is not empty.

184
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:46.700
If it is not empty, we want to loop over each images and upload it to the Firebase Storage.

185
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:53.060
And then after we are getting the uploaded images, you can see we are saying that when complete we

186
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.750
want to get the URL to the uploaded images.

187
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:07.070
So what we can simply do is over this next function, we can then say our it's upload upload images.

188
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.330
Applaud.

189
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.710
Upload.

190
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.800
I think we call upload images and we only can wait for future.

191
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.880
So what we can do, we can make this a future by saying future.

192
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.260
And so it is a type of future.

193
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.330
And this over the OC.

194
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.850
Click back on this.

195
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.960
And after running this function, right?

196
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:43.280
That is what I basically saying after running this function, then we can then say dot when completes

197
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:50.330
that is after uploading the images, you can see via what this function basically does is to upload

198
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.820
the images, right?

199
00:11:51.830 --> 00:12:02.180
And after successfully uploading the images, then only we we can just use an arrow function.

200
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.990
Then only we want to call the upload.

201
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.530
Products.

202
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.640
Sorry, upload data.

203
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.410
Function.

204
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.220
Okay.

205
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.530
And this is basically it.

206
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:21.760
And you can see why we have to get rid of that set state within the upload images function is this you

207
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:31.180
can see if we did not get rid of that set state, it will upload the images and just clear the fields

208
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.570
it made immediately.

209
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:38.560
It won't wait for hits to be uploaded in the cloud first or database.

210
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:46.000
So that was why we have to get rid of that state within the upload images function and you can see why

211
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.330
after it successfully uploads the image.

212
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:58.570
So the Firebase Storage, we then want to upload the data with all these fields and after uploaded data

213
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.090
we want to set a date.

214
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:08.920
So we set the images back to zero and we set the subcategory release back to empty and change back.

215
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.170
The main category value to be the default that is select main category.

216
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.590
And also we want to reset all our fields.

217
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.970
That is the price, quantity, product name and product description.

218
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.640
And you can see why this function sees it whole.

219
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:34.180
You can see why we are saying awaits upload images after uploading the images and after it completes,

220
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.520
we then want to upload the data.

221
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.360
Okay.

222
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.570
I think this is more clear by bit, Claire.

223
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.450
And now we have to get rid of.

224
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.290
This function of via.

225
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.540
I think we have a function.

226
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.370
Okay.

227
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.700
We do no longer need to call this what we have.

228
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.160
Upload, function, upload products that is dysfunctional via.

230
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.470
Right.

231
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.870
Okay.

232
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.820
This country.

233
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.800
And as to save.

234
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.630
And go try this out yourself.

235
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.310
Click on the gallery.

236
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.550
Gallery.

237
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.680
I think it's taking longer to.

238
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.520
Open.

239
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.300
Okay.

240
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.810
I'm just going to select shoes.

241
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:28.610
Shoes?

242
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:29.900
Sorry.

243
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.870
Is only.

244
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:34.830
And.

245
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.740
Select.

246
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.670
Okay.

247
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.530
And select me in category.

248
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.210
Four men.

249
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.720
Subcategory.

250
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.230
I do not have an issue.

251
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:52.690
Okay.

252
00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.190
I'm just going to say.

253
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:54.820
Okay.

254
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.240
Maybe shoes.

255
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.400
And I do not have any category yet for that.

256
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.510
You can just add that.

257
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:03.290
Okay.

258
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.680
I'm just going to go with a.

259
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.750
Women.

260
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.200
And for the subcategory.

261
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.520
I think we do not have that either.

262
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:23.880
We can just say either order and for the price this is going to say maybe five or $50.

263
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.680
The quantity we have five and the product name is just going to say our shoes.

264
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:38.580
In the future will we upload our products and for the description, just type something gibberish and

265
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.050
now click on.

266
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.210
Applaud and go check some inner.

267
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.240
New Terminer to see what's going on there.

268
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.330
Okay.

269
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.050
Okay.

270
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.770
We have no errors.

271
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:04.750
And go to this and back to data to see if that new product collection has been created.

272
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.690
Okay.

273
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.820
Not yet.

274
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.300
Go back and check what's happening.

275
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.220
I think we have this error.

276
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.420
Okay.

277
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.960
Let's see what's happening there.

278
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.440
On.

279
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.620
What we can just do is we start this.

280
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.340
Or should we start then?

281
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.250
And we have to wait for the process to finish.

282
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.310
And then we can try again.

283
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.360
Try again?

284
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.040
Okay.

285
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.680
Products.

286
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.990
And.

287
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.270
I'm just going to pick something.

288
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.950
Okay?

289
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.150
Maybe this.

290
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.240
Okay.

291
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:56.970
So let's.

292
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.150
And five, five, five.

293
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.280
Something gibberish and tap.

294
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.040
Something gibberish and upload.

295
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.150
And go check it out.

296
00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:15.619
Okay.

297
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.560
We tend to sign in first.

298
00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.510
You can see saying we should sign in first.

299
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.950
I think that should be where the error should be coming from.

300
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.300
Or let's just wait.

301
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.020
Okay.

302
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.150
That is where the hair is coming from.

303
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.840
So what you have to do now is to.

304
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.380
Changed black because it can't locate.

305
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:45.590
You can see why we are calling the firebase firebase dot instance that current user ID and definitely

306
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.010
is going to be no right.

307
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.930
You can see no check operator use on it, no value because you're calling this when there is no log

308
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:54.860
in user.

309
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:59.630
So what you have to do now is to change back this to.

310
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.540
Okay.

311
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.980
The initial route to say a.

312
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:14.570
Maybe seller login screen and you have to log in in order to upload products, right?

313
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:21.890
Because currently you are calling the Firebase ODS when the user is not currently logged in.

314
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.620
Okay.

315
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.200
Okay.

316
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:23.750
Do that.

317
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.570
Then in the next lecture, we are going to continue from there.

318
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.440
But before then, you can just check the collections over here.

319
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.470
You're going to see new collections called Products.

320
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.920
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
