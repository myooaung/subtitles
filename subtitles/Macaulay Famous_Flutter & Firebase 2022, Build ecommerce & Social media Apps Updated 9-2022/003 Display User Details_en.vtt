00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:01.950
Work.

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:09.000
In this lecture, we are going to display the user details over and over here.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.850
We are going to display the habit products.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.470
Okay.

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.440
But before then, what we are simply saying is you can see over here we are using a future beta.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.020
And remember, basically there are two popular ways to display data.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.670
That is the future beta or the stream beta.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:39.630
And the future beta has a property known as future which is basically referring to the source of the

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.170
data.

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.740
Right.

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.660
And you can see we have a variable called customer and we said it's equal to Firebase File Store instance,

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.350
dot collection and we basically want to have access to the customers collection.

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.460
Right.

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.910
Okay.

16
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.050
And also, you can see over here we have a variable called on the score art and it's equal to Firebase

17
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.129
instance.

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.150
And you can see why we are passing this on the score table.

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.790
And what we are simply saying is we are getting the current log logged in user who is currently purchasing

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.810
that products.

21
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.210
Okay.

22
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.950
So what we can then do is we can display that user details of yeah, okay, great.

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.740
Now it's in the container right outside the box decoration class.

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.020
So.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.920
Outside the box decoration class.

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.880
We can't have a child, sorry, child.

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.250
And the child is going to be a column widget because we want our data to be displayed vertically and.

28
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.330
Within the column, we can have a test.

29
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.560
This is going to say name and what we can do.

30
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.260
We can give it space and have this and we can use a dollar sign in order to concatenate a variable and

31
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.070
a test.

32
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.660
And you can see over here we have this variable called data data rights which basically have access

33
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.600
to all the data we have over it.

34
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.460
That is the address, ID and email for name and so on.

35
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.410
Great.

36
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.410
And we can then say.

37
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.780
Sorry, Dieter.

38
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.030
And we have a field in the database known as full name.

39
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.130
For them use control and that's a safe and you cannot determine how to train a in order to format this.

40
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.600
These are necessary again and.

41
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.200
Reloading this.

42
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.510
Okay.

43
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.820
Great.

44
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.150
You can see the wire admin.

45
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.200
Okay.

46
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.450
So I think I did this already.

47
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.610
I'm just going to get rid of it again and use constraints to save.

48
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.510
So you see how it's going to look like.

49
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.110
Okay.

50
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.960
You can see this is how it's going to look like.

51
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.840
And what we can do is within the container, we can then have a width.

52
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.530
And we can then say double dot infinity.

53
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.730
What does we do?

54
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.350
Is it you let the width take the available space horizontally?

55
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.300
It's control and that's the save.

56
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.140
Okay.

57
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.340
You should see it now.

58
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.640
Okay.

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.110
Great.

60
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.130
And another way is to say media.

61
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.090
Media.

62
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.970
Media query that of context the size than that width and just live this way without passing any times

63
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.990
or minus.

64
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.720
And this would basically get the width of our screen.

65
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.620
Okay.

66
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.350
Works in OC.

67
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.740
Now we send this column, we can say Cross us.

68
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.980
Elements cross us.

69
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.460
Cross us alignment.

70
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.610
Don't start.

71
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.600
Remember, it's going to work opposite for the raw.

72
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.589
Okay.

73
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.430
You should sit right now and.

74
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.130
Okay.

75
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.280
Grades and the other field we need.

76
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.570
We can just copy this.

77
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.340
And -- and -- OC is controlling us to save and we have to rename this to address.

78
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.220
Address and we have a field in the database known as address.

79
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.960
Okay.

80
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.580
And Fon, I think we have a field in the database which is a phone.

81
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.080
Okay.

82
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.630
We do not have that.

83
00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.960
Okay.

84
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.940
Well, it's I think we would be needing that.

85
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.750
Okay.

86
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.230
We're just going to have it later.

87
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.730
But for now, we can just go on the phone and we do not have anything yet for this.

88
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.820
You can just get rid of this or we can just hide it manually.

89
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.920
What we can do is.

90
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.970
Go to.

91
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.700
Sorry.

92
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.350
Okay.

93
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.760
Go to where?

94
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.470
Okay.

95
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.850
I think we have that the.

96
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.160
Hot further.

97
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.840
So controller's directory and auth controller.

98
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.160
Okay.

99
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.300
We can then have another field which is going to say Phone.

100
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.360
Okay.

101
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.250
This.

102
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.910
Okay.

103
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.510
And now what we have to do is to create a new accounts.

104
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.130
Right?

105
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:08.420
But another way is we can just create this field manually in the database for each user.

106
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.690
Consequently, we have just two customers so we can acquire hard field.

107
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.160
And this is going to be fun.

108
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.410
Okay.

109
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.860
Hard fun.

110
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.660
And we can add fuel for this again.

111
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.120
Fun.

112
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.360
So by this way, we do not need to delete and create a new account.

113
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.620
Grits and.

114
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.870
Back to the place.

115
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.540
Order.

116
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.180
This is then going to be.

117
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.070
Form to display the number of the user and currently.

118
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.800
It should be empty because we do not have any number to date yet.

119
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.630
Okay, great.

120
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.810
And the address.

121
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.120
We do not have any addresses that yet.

122
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.610
Or maybe we could just had a phone number.

123
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.460
It's going to have this.

124
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.510
That is okay.

125
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.650
Updates.

126
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.420
And since it's a future view there, we have to we have to save again.

127
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.390
In order to refresh.

128
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.380
Okay.

129
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.610
Okay, Cisco.

130
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.260
Okay.

131
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.890
And we can just wrap this with a pardon.

132
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.690
Wrap with pardon?

133
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.110
Okay.
