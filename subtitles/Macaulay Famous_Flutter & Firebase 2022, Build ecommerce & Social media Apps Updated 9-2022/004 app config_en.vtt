00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.740
You're welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.720
In this lecture, we're going to do some configurations.

4
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.130
Okay.

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.430
Now, the first thing we're going to need to do is we're going to create the directory where our image

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.600
is going to be stored.

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.990
Okay.

8
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.140
And we're going to create this directory in this zoom.

9
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.930
Have that tree that is within this.

10
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.810
Okay.

11
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.990
That is the create it for the year.

12
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.190
What we can do is we can go to the post, back that YAML file and over here we can then click on New

13
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.580
for the and we're going to call this for the assets.

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.720
Okay.

15
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.620
And over this asset directory, we're going to create a new photo.

16
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.900
You can call it directory or footer.

17
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.290
Okay.

18
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.870
So what is assets for the directory?

19
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.020
You're going to create a new directory.

20
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.470
Okay.

21
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.890
And we can call this images.

22
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.380
Okay.

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.220
Great.

24
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.640
Now I'm just gonna copy the image, and that is going to be available to you.

25
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.510
Okay, copy.

26
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.590
And next up, we call this Zoom app you can see is within this directory.

27
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.950
Right.

28
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.280
Okay.

29
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.460
So we can go to the assets and images and then paste this.

30
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.420
Okay.

31
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.660
Now, the next thing to do is to tell flowchart that we just added this image card onboarding docs jpg.

32
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.070
Okay.

33
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.280
Not to do that.

34
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.950
Going to need to go to the.

35
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.920
Was that the jumbo fire?

36
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.890
And as I can see, we have this assets, right.

37
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.150
Is it just cruel to look for this?

38
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.500
Okay.

39
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.170
So now what we can do is we can uncomment this and get rid of this.

40
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.150
So now we have not had the wherewithal to fly to the location of this image we have.

41
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.650
Okay.

42
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.920
So the location this the onboarding jeopardy is and.

43
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.520
The assets that are tree and then images that we and then we can just see a backslash.

44
00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.830
What is going to do is what is going to go into this images folder and then assess all our images.

45
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.140
And for now, we just have one image.

46
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.620
Okay, now we can then use contra and that's the save and that's what gets what we just did.

47
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.130
Or you can simply click on gets packages.

48
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.500
Okay.

49
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.290
Okay.

50
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.910
Okay, okay.

51
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.840
Just going to take some time and it's going to be done.

52
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.240
Okay.

53
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.030
He disclosed this.

54
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.570
Okay.

55
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.250
Now, the next step is hopefully we got Nocera and.

56
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.120
Hopefully we got no hair.

57
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.690
Okay.

58
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.420
Well, we can just do is gets the package again.

59
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.830
Okay.

60
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.580
Okay.

61
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.950
Now, the next step is we're going to define some colors we need.

62
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.430
Okay.

63
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.710
So obviously dietary.

64
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.250
What we can do is we can just create a new food for this.

65
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.610
Okay.

66
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.360
And we can call this for the use sales.

67
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.410
Okay.

68
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.790
Okay.

69
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.800
You can see it's done.

70
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.180
Okay.

71
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.650
Then over this utils, we can create a new fly and you can call this five colors.

72
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.680
Colors dart dots.

73
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.250
Okay.

74
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.010
Now, I'm just going to pierce this color I have.

75
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.900
You can easily just pause this video to copy.

76
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.830
Sorry to type right away, but it's going to be available to you.

77
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.800
So all we can do is to use contra an s to save this file.

78
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.210
Okay.

79
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.640
Okay.

80
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.050
Now what we can also do is we can change the scene.

81
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.880
You can see currently it is wide.

82
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.150
So what we can do is we can change the same of our heart.

83
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.450
Not to do that, we're going to need to go to the main, the Dutch fire and we can use country and be

84
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.620
okay.

85
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.970
Now what we can do is we can get rid of this and now we can set team, right?

86
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.180
We want to change the team of our advocacy team.

87
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.470
They are.

88
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.000
Same data and then diet doc.

89
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.200
I think we need this.

90
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.370
And now what?

91
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.360
We start this.

92
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.680
Okay.

93
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.710
Okay.

94
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.250
Okay.

95
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.760
Okay.

96
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.950
Okay, okay.

97
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.460
Okay.

98
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.850
Okay.

99
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.230
Let's we start.

100
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.800
Okay.

101
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.140
Ack ack ack ack ack ack.

102
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.910
Now we can check.

103
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.070
This is going to refresh this now.

104
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.300
Okay, great.

105
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.740
I can see now what we can as well do over here.

106
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.180
We can see that's copy widths.

107
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.770
What this simply is, is we are simply saying we want to use all the properties this team did at The

108
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:49.800
Dark Horse and as well we want to use our whole property as well so that we can see scaffold background

109
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.280
colour.

110
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:58.740
Now you can see everything you see over here is referred to as a scaffold the same way in this HTML

111
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.420
you have by the right.

112
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.760
So everything you see over here is a fed.

113
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.850
So what as a scaffold you can see the log in screen as well in the log in.

114
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.920
Okay, we have this in the views and log in screen.

115
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.560
You can see we have this scaffold, right?

116
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.120
So we can see the scaffold.

117
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.620
Okay.

118
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.300
So I think.

119
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.230
We are okay scaffold color.

120
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.600
Then we can use the background color which we just defined in the colors.

121
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.780
They're in the colors.

122
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.470
You can see why it colors.

123
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.800
Okay.

124
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.720
They find the reason it does not get imported.

125
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.280
You can alight in this country and dodge the imports.

126
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.480
It's.

127
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.230
Okay.

128
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.740
Now what we can do is all we start this and go check.

129
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.750
You can see some bits different.

130
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.200
Okay.

131
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.730
Use this on a big difference now and.

132
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.250
Okay.

133
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.730
Okay.

134
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.210
Okay.

135
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.600
Okay.

136
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.080
Okay.

137
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.920
Okay.

138
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.910
Okay.

139
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.450
You can see.

140
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.850
Okay.

141
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.390
So now what we are simply doing, we are using the properties, the same data the DAC has and as well

142
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.630
we are also using our own property.

143
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.130
Okay.

144
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.630
Okay.

145
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.250
Just basically it's okay, guys.

146
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.140
Saying the Nasdaq.
