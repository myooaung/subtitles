00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.650
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.780
Now, this lecture will create the test field, so the users are going to be able to log in.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.110
Now they are going to have to test field, that is the email and the password.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
So users are going to be able to log in using the email and password.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.180
Okay.

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.620
Now, if your system is showing that line, what you can simply do is to use control and as to see if

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.540
that is going to go up.

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.230
Okay.

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.910
Now over.

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.040
This body is going to remove this.

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.270
Okay.

13
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.490
This is going to be a container.

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.260
Okay.

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.410
Now, all of which is going to be displayed from top to bottom, that is vertically.

16
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.610
So they're going to be using a widget called color.

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.480
Okay.

18
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.330
This is going to take multiple turns.

19
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.980
So it has to.

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.170
To drain property.

21
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.930
Okay, now what you can see.

22
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.670
We can see a test.

23
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.990
If you'd like.

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.890
Now we're going to see a declaration that's going to be imputes.

25
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.540
Decoration.

26
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.950
Right.

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.520
Okay.

28
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.320
I'm going to have to.

29
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.270
There's going to have to be a first rate policy outline.

30
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.770
At Line Imputes.

31
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.820
Okay, sir, I'm going to give you whatever dosages you can see.

32
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.000
Border with the US.

33
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.350
Border with us.

34
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.570
That's circular.

35
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.830
We want to look now as well outside the outline if we can have the interest.

36
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.680
You can see test.

37
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
Let's say I didn't hear you come all the way.

38
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.210
You can see.

39
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.930
Email.

40
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.259
Okay.

41
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.610
Which I guess is who?

42
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.970
Okay.

43
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.870
Go check it out.

44
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.010
Okay.

45
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.940
This is the way.

46
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.410
Okay.

47
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.300
As well, although I do still feel we can have other that as food a reason to give it in a coma there.

48
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.630
Okay.

49
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.130
It is going to be test food again for the sake of my strength.

50
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.890
I love doing this from scratch.

51
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.000
Okay.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.420
It is going to be decoration is going to be imputes.

53
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.170
The Christian right.

54
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.970
Okay.

55
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.820
So they're going to have to put the outline in border.

56
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.740
Okay.

57
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.740
So give it border.

58
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.290
Whatever does is going to be the.

59
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.760
What I would use that circle of 20 as well.

60
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.360
Okay.

61
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.210
I'm going to have to try to call my attitude.

62
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.960
Colleagues control this disease.

63
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.040
Okay.

64
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.950
Good.

65
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.030
Now I'll say the other line, but we can see.

66
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.160
It's just.

67
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.670
Again.

68
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.630
So this is going to be.

69
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.760
Password.

70
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.270
Password.

71
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.050
Okay.

72
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.090
Now we'll take as we'll see.

73
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.760
We can give the preface.

74
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.120
I call you can see icon widgets.

75
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.730
It's going to be icons that.

76
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.700
Email.

77
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.130
Okay.

78
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.110
District.

79
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.110
Chile, Colombia.

80
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.020
Okay.

81
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.930
You're going to do the same thing.

82
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.970
So I got to see Patrice Icon.

83
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.030
There's going to be icon.

84
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.590
Then icons that look.

85
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.130
Okay.

86
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.400
Good.

87
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.030
Critical critical analysis of.

88
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.450
Okay.

89
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.300
Go check it out.

90
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.529
Okay.

91
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.010
It is it.

92
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.570
You know what you can do?

93
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.890
We can.

94
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.710
Over here.

95
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.080
We can see alignment.

96
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.740
We want it to be centered element.

97
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.900
The center.

98
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.410
Okay.

99
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.360
Now let's see what it does.

100
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.300
Okay.

101
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.680
Let's do this.

102
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.490
You know what you can do over here?

103
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.780
Over the caller you can see us is alignment.

104
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.240
With us is alignment.

105
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.720
Dos Santos is going to take you to the center vertically.

106
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.860
Okay, great.

107
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.140
Now you can see we don't have any space, so we're going to give you some padding.

108
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.340
So over this container, you can just see a in edge.

109
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.790
They said that all or probably 20 that all sides.

110
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.340
Okay.

111
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.440
It's going to be okay.

112
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.900
Great.

113
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.190
Now we're going to give you space between the email and the password.

114
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.200
So now what you can't do?

115
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.870
Whether you're a really good sized boss.

116
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.270
Size looks or are given this harden now given the space vertically right so there's going to be heights

117
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.430
of only 15.

118
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.170
Okay.

119
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.920
Go check it out.

120
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.660
I think that is going to give.

121
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.690
Explain to.

122
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.800
Okay.

123
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.430
Great.

124
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.820
Right.

125
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.000
So you can see how easy it is, right?

126
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.030
Okay, guys, send in the.
