00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.090
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:01.859
Or come.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.300
In this lecture, users are going to be able to do latent.

4
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.960
But before then you can see currently we have imposed the display name of the user.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.390
Well, what you can also do, we can give this a room to change this display name to something else.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.920
Okay.

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.550
Not to do this are going to go back to our visa code.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.040
Then we're going to go to the comptroller's folder since we have agreed that the comptroller's folder

9
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.740
is going to be created in all our logics.

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.260
Right.

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.670
Okay.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.630
So now we are going to go to the Jets, see this go controller fly.

13
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.020
Then we are going to use Control and B to make this way.

14
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.530
Okay.

15
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.860
Now over this create meeting function, we're going to pass in an additional variable.

16
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.580
So over here we are going to give it freely cover.

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.060
Then we'll go passing a variable called user name and we are not going to make this required.

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.660
Now we're also going to specify the type.

19
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.740
It is a type of string because it is a test.

20
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.290
Then it is going to say equal to an empty string for now.

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.550
Okay.

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.380
Now we're going to scroll down.

23
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.680
Over here.

24
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.700
We are going to do some check.

25
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.740
So now we are going to say if.

26
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.050
That's user name variable we just created dot is.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.140
Empty.

28
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.730
That's me as the user did not provide any name.

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.240
The U.S. did not provide any names.

30
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.600
Right.

31
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.050
And because of that, we just want to.

32
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.340
Go with this.

33
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.330
Discipline.

34
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.920
Okay.

35
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.400
So now what we can do again is we can say.

36
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.230
Is going to go to this end.

37
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.480
We can create another variable called name and it's is a type of string because it is a test.

38
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.610
I just semicolon.

39
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:09.090
Okay.

40
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.100
Now, what we are going to do on this this webinar did this variable called name.

41
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.070
So if it is empty, that's because the user wants to go with this display name.

42
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.670
So we are going to say name is equal to underscore or it's.

43
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.440
Arts Comptroller.

44
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.650
Dodds.

45
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.060
User turds displaying their right.

46
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.860
Okay.

47
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.290
Now add your.

48
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.530
This over.

49
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.970
Okay.

50
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.900
Great.

51
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.950
Now over here, we are going to say else that is the user actually want to change that display name.

52
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.870
So this is going to be name is equal to the user name.

53
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.640
Okay, great.

54
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.530
Right.

55
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.640
Okay.

56
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.280
Now use controls to save this file.

57
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.570
And then use control and be in that to make this world again.

58
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.540
Then now you're going to go to the video call screen.

59
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.480
Now, in the last lecture we had earlier created the join button and we made this clickable by using

60
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.790
the inkwell and then the on tap.

61
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.620
And over here we created a function which we made.

62
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.620
Privates are the reason for the private is because we don't want to be able to fill to this join medicine

63
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.030
aside this flag.

64
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.320
Right.

65
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.740
Okay.

66
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.060
So now what's it going to do?

67
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.790
First, we are use this.

68
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.340
Creates meets in function or via.

69
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.750
Now in order to have access to this, creates misinformation.

70
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.720
We first going to have access to this class, right?

71
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.200
Because this is the father and this is the child.

72
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.660
Not to do that over the video screen, because control and data, they decide.

73
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.550
Then over here, we're going to create a fine variable.

74
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:28.250
Then there's going to be the type of GSC controller that the rebel is going to be a part of.

75
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.980
It is going to be what it's called GSC Controller.

76
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.960
Then it's going to be equal to that GSC Controller class.

77
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.440
Okay.

78
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.650
Yet see.

79
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.360
Controller.

80
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.670
Okay, great.

81
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.310
Now over here a little bit is down there on the score, Jesse.

82
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.100
GSC Controller ten create.

83
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.780
Richard.

84
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.210
Okay.

85
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.560
Now for the room name.

86
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.390
It's gonna be the meats in.

87
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.920
I'd.

88
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:13.510
Controller there to get value you just have to say dot test okay for the is audio muted we're just going

89
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.740
to set this to.

90
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.470
The true.

91
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.350
And for the video view, Ted.

92
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.930
As well we can.

93
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.390
As I said institute in the future videos are going to let out a.

94
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.770
We'll make this advance.

95
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.150
Right.

96
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.610
Okay.

97
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.760
So we can then had a semicolon over there.

98
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.620
Okay, great.

99
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.620
Now you can see really we don't have to pass in this extra fields.

100
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.010
We.

101
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.000
Had had over a year.

102
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.130
That's his username.

103
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.120
The reason is because we did not make it a required field.

104
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.200
What?

105
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.540
We can just pass it, right?

106
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.810
Okay.

107
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.220
So now we're going to go back to the.

108
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.600
Video screen.

109
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.590
So now they're going to need to either they're going to use the name.

110
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.360
These are name is going to be the.

111
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.940
You name I take recorded name controller.

112
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.710
Then to get the value, we have to say to the test.

113
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.280
Okay.

114
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.910
Now you can use your controls to save or use or restart, not to save or those or certifies.

115
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.200
Okay.

116
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.810
Now you're going to need to check this out, right?

117
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.220
Okay.

118
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.460
Okay.

119
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.120
He's going to take us back, I think.

120
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.650
Okay.

121
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.810
Then.

122
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.770
It's going to get rid of this.

123
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.440
Okay.

124
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.030
So we're going to keep on doing that, right?

125
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.350
Okay.

126
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.100
Now for the group idea, I'm just going to put.

127
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.980
Something that does not exist.

128
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.000
Of course I have not created a new room yet.

129
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.450
For now.

130
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.230
Okay, we do have a look.

131
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.280
We conjoin what the room idea is going to be to the indicative from the oak.

132
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.980
You can see it now.

133
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.900
Very right.

134
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.630
Okay.

135
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.870
They can see it.

136
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.790
Now.

137
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.660
We did not change the display name.

138
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.490
You can see we would not do anything to display names.

139
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.840
Automatically go got the logged in user.

140
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.620
That's been the words.

141
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.980
Okay.

142
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.190
Now currently it is not going to work because this ID I.D. as logic created.

143
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.520
Right.

144
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.160
So you can actually just click on the.

145
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.320
Quick or new in.

146
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.290
The room right here is the one.

147
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.020
This is the Almighty.

148
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.700
You can pass.

149
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.140
Okay.

150
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.030
So can you just terminate this?

151
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.930
Okay, so what you're going to do is able to share this app with your friends.

152
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.650
So this is of use in the zone app.

153
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.860
You can use this way you can use your own have created by you.

154
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.460
Right.

155
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:08.420
You can see it as I think it has also few shows where you can raise and you can raise as always.

156
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.500
And yet since.

157
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.440
There is no other user.

158
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.620
But we can't associates.

159
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.660
Well, they can't charge.

160
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.370
They can do everything.

161
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.190
So you can basically do as.

162
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.510
Right.

163
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:26.930
Okay.

164
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.320
You can do basically everything.

165
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.950
You can go from locations.

166
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.280
You can see.

167
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.020
Right.

168
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.490
Okay.

169
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.480
So we're just going to.

170
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.169
Okay.

171
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:44.330
So what you can do is you can you can share this app with your friends, friends, families, loved

172
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:44.770
ones.

173
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.640
You sort of using Zoom.

174
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.350
You can use the app created by you.

175
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.860
And in this lecture, I want to see a way to improve this more.

176
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.340
Okay?

177
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.250
Okay, guys, see you in.

178
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.410
This picture is the first time and it's my call.
