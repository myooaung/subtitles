00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.350
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:10.200
Worker In the last lecture we created this function called had product two cots, and then in the parentheses

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.470
we pass all these dynamic variables.

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.010
Right.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.330
And over here we are saying if the product as if we had that to the users cats then we just want to

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:32.110
update that product has if it has not been added then we want to have that product by using this method

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.760
called puts if upset.

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.110
Okay, great.

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.630
So now in this lecture, we are going to need to call this function called hot product two cuts.

10
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.430
But before that, what we also need to do is.

11
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.300
Over here within the function we need to say.

12
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.710
Not I.

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.000
Listener.

14
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.900
Okay.

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.190
What this will do is it will listen to changes the user is making to the cards and immediately is going

16
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.780
to need to update the UI.

17
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.230
Okay.

18
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.840
So now we can use controller and save.

19
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.020
And before we need to call this function all before we call this function, we need to go to the main

20
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.960
that FY and do the same thing that we did for the product provider.

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.500
Okay.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.270
Okay.

23
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.810
Now as well, or where we tend to provide us.

24
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
We need to had a true coma and use the change.

25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.560
Notify a provider.

26
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.120
Right.

27
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.500
Okay.

28
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.220
Is going to be the score then.

29
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.680
Our function is going to be cots.

30
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.610
That's why the OC.

31
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.880
They use control and that's a safe.

32
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.260
Okay.

33
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.700
Okay.

34
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.880
So now we can call this function, right?

35
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.139
Okay.

36
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.460
So I going need to go to the detail page right where this button is.

37
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.180
Okay.

38
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.950
So we can.

39
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.980
Then go to detail page.

40
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.280
And over here we can use culture and beats.

41
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.370
Make swipe and look for the hearts of.

42
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.420
What's it like?

43
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.870
I think there's a value.

44
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.040
Then you've got to have access to this.

45
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.810
Function of an.

46
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.600
This function over here, we need to first have access to this Cox provider class.

47
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.930
Okay.

48
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.880
So what we're just going to do is.

49
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.330
Over the detail page you can.

50
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.420
Okay.

51
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.490
We can just copy this.

52
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.890
Right.

53
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.270
Okay.

54
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.130
And paste, but this is going to be card.

55
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.940
Cut.

56
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.210
Provider.

57
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.160
Or you can call this on the score cards.

58
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.670
On the scorecards.

59
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.670
Provide a check.

60
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.040
Okay.

61
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.830
That's okay.

62
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.320
And we're going to change this to.

63
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.300
The cards provider.

64
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.810
Okay.

65
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.550
Great.

66
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.840
So we changed the function.

67
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.220
Okay.

68
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.000
This is The View.

69
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.650
Oh, we just have to say it's on the score card for writer and art.

70
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.880
You can see we have access to the hot product.

71
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.830
COX okay, great.

72
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.070
So now we're going to need to pass in all this.

73
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.019
Ability to pass in all the values for those variable we how they are created.

74
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.269
Okay now for the price is going to be.

75
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.480
You put a prize, right?

76
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.890
Traverses two deaths.

77
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.990
I think we really have to be rebel.

78
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.390
That has access to all our products.

79
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.020
Okay.

80
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.710
There's going to be product attribute, right?

81
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.090
Okay.

82
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.860
So there is going to be.

83
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.340
Her that.

84
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.490
Archibald Dutch.

85
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.490
Price okay grades and for the title is going to be.

86
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.520
Her doubts.

87
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.300
Achieve would not take you and.

88
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.870
Obama is going to have products.

89
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.660
Attributes Dutch image real.

90
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.090
Okay.

91
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.290
Great.

92
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.160
Right is untrue and excessive.

93
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.040
Now, by clicking on this button.

94
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.390
We have already had this product to our carts.

95
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.140
Okay.

96
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.660
Now we just have to do is to try to display that products we just added in a new screen.

97
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.350
Okay.

98
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.610
Well, before then.

99
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.650
If you forgotten that we did this, you can easily just go back to it again.

100
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.860
Most of the time you need to watch this course probably up to five times, six times in enough for you

101
00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.080
to master the code or know how to do it yourself from scratch.

102
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.630
Right.

103
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.010
So understand as one.

104
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.060
And so my study codes is another thing.

105
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.650
So you might want to watch this video of two five times repeated and repeated.

106
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.370
So you must have attitudes by yourself from scratch.

107
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.790
Okay.

108
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.790
So this is basically it's so by clicking on this what seems that clicking on this we have already had

109
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.220
that is put up to our cards.

110
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.780
Now the next ten are going to do it is going to display this product in the card screen.

111
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.230
Okay.

112
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.400
Okay.

113
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.590
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
