00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.890
In this section, we're going to be able to upload products and as well been able to retrieve products.

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.770
Now head up to a faster database.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.760
And over here we are going to click on stats collection and we are going to call this collection products.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.220
Right.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.570
Okay.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.190
Now is products are going to be connected to this products based on something known as UID.

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.730
So we can just type in your idea or we can just click on this in order to automatically generate one

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.190
for us.

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.570
Okay.

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.460
Now, the first field we need is going to be the hide of the products.

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.780
Right.

14
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.980
So over here.

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.140
You can type it.

16
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.180
There's going to be a test.

17
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.870
Right.

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.810
So we can just copy this.

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.400
So.

20
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.100
Copy.

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.620
This is going to get rid of this and I'm just going to quit this.

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.430
Okay, then paste this over here.

23
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.510
Okay.

24
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.750
Now, the second we need is the tighter of the.

25
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.670
Right.

26
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.860
Okay, then there's this as well.

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.560
That said, we need this.

28
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.000
The description of the products.

29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.780
Is going to get rid of this again.

30
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.960
The description of the products.

31
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.840
Okay.

Boswell.

34
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.290
Going to copy that.

35
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.690
Okay.

36
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.310
It is also a test, right?

37
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.700
Okay.

38
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.560
How can you feel it again?

39
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.160
Okay.

40
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.430
We also didn't do need for.

41
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.360
The prize.

42
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.400
Okay.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.680
Prize.

44
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.540
There's not going to be a shrink, but.

45
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.930
There's going to be a number.

46
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.630
Right.

47
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.950
Okay.

48
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.050
As well we can.

49
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.390
Then there's this.

50
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.100
Okay.

51
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.180
The other field we need is what?

52
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.490
The image URL.

53
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.090
Okay.

54
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.800
Outfield.

55
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.530
There's been a screw down.

56
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.000
Okay.

57
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.910
Image, Yara.

58
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.220
Now we're going to leave this empty.

59
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.630
For now.

60
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.620
We can just add this.

61
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.100
Says it aspects in this walk image.

62
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.440
Okay.

63
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.960
We're just going to leave this empty for now.

64
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.340
Okay.

65
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.910
Okay.

66
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.240
We also need a product category name.

67
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.570
Ad field.

68
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.540
As all it is is strange, right?

69
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.960
Okay.

70
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.610
There's going to be phones.

71
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.020
Okay.

72
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.150
Click on this.

73
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.990
Okay.

74
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.970
As well.

75
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.330
I feel.

76
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.140
We need for the quantity.

77
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.320
Just going to be five is going to be a number, right?

78
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.710
Okay.

79
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.550
There's going to be five.

80
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.860
Okay.

81
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.120
I think that is all.

82
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.790
Okay.

83
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.440
Now click on Save.

84
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.900
Okay.

85
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.940
You can see to where you can see each product is linked to this product.

86
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.730
Each product is linked to this product.

87
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.240
This product collection based on something known as unity.

88
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.030
So you can just add another product.

89
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.810
So they as well.

90
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.950
To generate a unity and.

91
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.480
Okay.

92
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.390
For this as well.

93
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.100
There's going to be.

94
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.810
The first field is the idea.

95
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.610
Staring at food.

96
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.720
Okay.

97
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.579
Try to.

98
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.090
Okay.

99
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.980
This should be tied to.

100
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.260
Back at field.

101
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.470
This should the discussion.

102
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.160
Okay.

103
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.750
Compare the description.

104
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.590
Okay.

105
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.960
As well.

106
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.420
The price of the products.

107
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.250
As field.

108
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.020
This is going to be number.

109
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.960
Because I mean, sorry.

110
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.790
Can you see if this person number is going to be 19 at nine I.

111
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.250
Okay.

112
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.440
As well we need for the imagery.

113
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.300
Like I said, expect an issue type that is a network image.

114
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.790
So you can't just do this other string for now.

115
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.930
Okay.

116
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.230
Okay.

117
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.200
The products category name.

118
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.740
Okay.

119
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.970
You can see how complex it is.

120
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.340
So I put that from the five star database.

121
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.100
That is why you're going to need an admin partner in a nutshell to organize everything more with.

122
00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.290
Okay.

123
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.150
The last is the quantity.

124
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.680
Okay.

125
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.480
And it's going to be a type of number.

126
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.060
And I think we just have two products.

127
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.670
Okay.

128
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.580
And I think I'm safe.

129
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.720
Okay.

130
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.670
Now, you can see we have two products, right?

131
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.090
Okay.

132
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.020
Okay.

133
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.790
Now we have successfully uploaded a product to the database.

134
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.040
Right now, the next thing we are going to do is to upload an image.

135
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.470
You're going to be doing this through this storage.

136
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.810
Okay, then we're going to copy the link.

137
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.250
And how did you.

138
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.220
So that was what it does.

139
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.290
Well, that that's what we are going to do in the next picture, then in the other lecture are going

140
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:51.260
to be able to fetch the products is going to be on our have they're going to fetch it to the fit screen.

141
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.700
Okay.
