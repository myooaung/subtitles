00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.660
In this lecture, you will know not to use the bottom --, but before then, what we can do is we

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.090
can use control and beat to make this wide.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:21.720
And then within the scaffold, the scaffold has a property which is known as bottom sheds.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.010
Okay.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.480
And we are going to have three main widgets or four main widgets over here, and they're going to be

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.390
displayed horizontally, that is from left to right.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.780
So for this purpose, we are going to be using a row widgets.

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.680
And as you know, the row can take multiple widgets.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.090
Okay.

12
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.520
The first child is going to be a test results, which is going to say to.

13
00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.900
We can add this to it and give it space and then had a backslash in the to use the dollar sign.

14
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.350
The last sign side had they turned the corner and is culture and has to save.

15
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.420
And you're going to see it over here.

16
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.850
We can have this tie to this test style.

17
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.480
Start, we can increase the font size to 17 this year and that's to save.

18
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.500
Okay.

19
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.620
And.

20
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.680
We can then have another test which ends before then.

21
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.560
We need it to come out of here and we're going to have another test with that, which is going to be

22
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.330
for the amount and for the now we can say zero dot.

23
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.390
We can use this 00.00 and how this tie.

24
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.390
Test STI.

25
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.370
And we can.

26
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.430
Just change the color to colors that may be red or.

27
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.320
Read or maybe see or sign whatever you call it.

28
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.390
Okay.

29
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.610
And we can also increase the font size to maybe 710.

30
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.430
So it's going to be equal to that of this.

31
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.050
Okay.

32
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.150
Great.

33
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.430
And the last widget we need is going to be a button, which is going to be for the checkout button.

34
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.100
To do this, we have to come out from the test, right?

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.290
Okay.

36
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.100
And we're going to use that.

37
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.240
Matt, Syria.

38
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.200
But thin material person.

39
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.560
Okay on first.

40
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.530
And.

41
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.060
Child.

42
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.270
This is going to be a test with jazz, and we can just use a capital letter which is going to say check

43
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.850
outs in order to come over there.

44
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.270
It said via OC.

45
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.890
Instead of wrapping this with a a matte Syria, we can just wrap this with a container, right?

46
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.330
Just as we have to go as streamlined in order to use the border radius.

47
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.480
Okay, wrap weeds container.

48
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.700
And we can give this container a height that is out.

49
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.010
Or how long is going to be.

50
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.650
We can give it a height of maybe 40.

51
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.060
Or probably we can just go with 35 and we can specify how wide we want this button to be.

52
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.210
And we can just get the width of our screen by saying media, media, query of context, the size,

53
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.760
the tweet.

54
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.390
So by doing this, so to size the tweet, by doing this, we have the width of our screen.

55
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.020
So what we can then do, we can test it by zero.

56
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.150
That's four zero.

57
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.690
That's five.

58
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.250
That is 45%.

59
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.140
The case controller.

60
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.970
And as to save.

61
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.380
Okay.

62
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.680
We can't really see this because we have also have to give a color to the button that is the background,

63
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.459
right?

64
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.600
To do that, we have to use the decoration in order to have access to other purposes like border radius.

65
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.100
If not, we can just go ahead and have the color this way.

66
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.970
Okay.

67
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.990
So decoration and box decoration.

68
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.380
So.

69
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.540
Books.

70
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.810
Decoration.

71
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.930
The Christian and for the color we can say colors the black.

72
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.440
And our digital cover and go check this out.

73
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.080
Okay.

74
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.700
And what we have to do, we are going to have this tie to this and test style.

75
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.720
And we can change the color to colors that.

76
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.000
That's why it's.

77
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.540
Okay.

78
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.340
Okay, great.

79
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.700
And we can make this have a rounded shape to do that.

80
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:34.030
The Border Declaration has the border with U.S. property, and we can then say border radius.

81
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.860
Dot.

82
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.060
Secular of 25.

83
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.220
We want it to be very, very round.

84
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.400
25.

85
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.960
Okay.

86
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.050
Okay.

87
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.710
Great.

88
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.550
And now we can take this over here.

89
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.520
Okay.

90
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.650
We can't go to the RO.

91
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.660
And we can then say main --.

92
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.440
Sorry.

93
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.080
Via.

94
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.560
We can then say assess alignment, may assess alignment.

95
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.500
This is going to be me as this other man.

96
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.090
We can just try this space equally.

97
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.370
And see I was going to look like.

98
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.620
Maybe this is okay.

99
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.780
Well, we could just say.

100
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.350
Space.

101
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.070
The space evenly will basically give it more space.

102
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.120
You can see the space we have of the same as the space we have of a similar space.

103
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.250
We have a nearby problem.

104
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.230
Probably you can just go with this.

105
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.930
And we could also just say space between.

106
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.450
Okay.

107
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:04.290
You can see now, and maybe we can then wrap this with a pardon to have some breathing space over each

108
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.880
age, maybe ten or 15, and go check it out.

109
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.630
Okay.

110
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.510
Seems good.

111
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:18.530
So now we have padding at the left, top, bottom right in all sides.

112
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:25.580
So I think this is okay and maybe we could just increase or make this test board.

113
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.380
Okay.

114
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.010
We can then say font.

115
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.190
With foreign tweets.

116
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.620
Funds with the port and for.

117
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:49.130
The prize, that is for the actual amount we can use as property, not as little as percent to have

118
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:55.970
some space between each litre and we can save it before.

119
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.260
And check this out.

120
00:07:59.660 --> 00:07:59.950
Okay.

121
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.640
See?

122
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.300
Sounds good, right?

123
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.580
And maybe for the tutor as well.

124
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.490
We can have the latest episode and we can then set maybe this the theory.

125
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.510
To have some space between each test.

126
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.940
Okay.

127
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.320
I think this is okay.

128
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.700
Okay.

129
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.880
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
