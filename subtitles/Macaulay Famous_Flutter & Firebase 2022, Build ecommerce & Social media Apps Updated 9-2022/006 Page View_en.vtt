00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.350
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.970
In this lecture, we're going to talk about Page View, which is very similar to that of the list view

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.110
the view there.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.760
Okay.

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.050
Now over here, you can see we have the list of the category names.

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.960
And what we are going to do in this lecture is whenever we click on this main category, we are going

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
to have the main high time display over year.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.980
And when we click on this women category, we're going to have the women categories display over that

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.610
is the women category item displayed over here.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.180
Okay.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.260
Now to do this, we have to head back to our VTS record and you can see over here we are basically having

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.210
a position with that in order to tell how the container is going to be placed.

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.310
And as you know, the position has a property known as bottom and you can see we are setting it to zero.

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.720
And also they do have a property known as right.

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.870
And you can see we are also setting it to zero.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.370
Okay.

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.080
And we are having a child, which is a container.

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.190
And as you know, the container has a property known as eight.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.650
And we're basically getting the width of our screen in order to make this responsive.

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.220
So we got the so we got the height of our screen and we are taking it by 8%.

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.480
And as well we got the width of our screen and we also about 80%, that is we need 80% of our screen

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.010
and we're basically giving it a color of white.

24
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.450
We can just give this red.

25
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.820
So you see, what we basically did is control and has okay, you're going to see it obvious.

26
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.310
You can see it's taken 80% of our width and 80% of our height.

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.550
Okay.

28
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.480
And now we can just change this back to.

29
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.380
Right.

30
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.930
Okay.

31
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.700
And as you know, the container has a property known as child for the child is going to be this widget

32
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.870
you've not seen before.

33
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.980
Page view.

34
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.150
The page view can take multiple widgets.

35
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:18.640
So it has these children as its property and the first child is going to be according to what we have

36
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.030
of it.

37
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.160
That is the main the main category name.

38
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
So this is going to be the content for the main category.

39
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.540
Okay.

40
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.130
We have men, women, shoes.

41
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.400
So for the now we can just use a center widget center and then have a child test.

42
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.000
This is going to say men and you can see we have up to.

43
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.540
One, two, three, four, five.

44
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.130
So we can just duplicate this for more times.

45
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.570
But before then, you need to try to come over there.

46
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.210
And.

47
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.970
2234, five OC and now use can and save.

48
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.070
And now we have to rename this.

49
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.900
This is going to be.

50
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.620
Women.

51
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.200
And shoes, kids.

52
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.590
Shoes, Keats and Bach.

53
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.090
Okay.

54
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.140
Shoes.

55
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.570
Shoes.

56
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.630
Kids.

57
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.270
And bugs.

58
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.990
Okay.

59
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.450
You can just add as box is necessary and go check it out.

60
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.160
Okay.

61
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.290
You can see the by default we are able to scroll.

62
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.500
We're able to scroll horizontally.

63
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.270
That is from left to right.

64
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.150
Okay.

65
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.950
And what we can do is the page view has a property known as screw direction.

66
00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.200
And for the screw direction we can then see as is dot vertical that is from top to bottom.

67
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.910
Okay.

68
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.870
And now we are going to be able to screw this way.

69
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.510
Okay.

70
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:16.329
And all you're going to need to do is whenever we scroll down to the key category we want to navigate.

71
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.350
We want this to be the selected category name.

72
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.300
Right.

73
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.940
Okay.

74
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.050
To do that.

75
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:33.020
The Page View has a property known as on page change, which is a function over this parenthesis is

76
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.460
going to take a value.

77
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.280
We're just going to call this value.

78
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.470
So value.

79
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.990
Get rid of this.

80
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.050
The value is is basically referring to the selected item.

81
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.080
And now all we can just do is overhear.

82
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.560
We can't just copy everything we have via its end credits.

83
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.940
Sorry from this for.

84
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.320
And.

85
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.480
-- it over.

86
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.960
Remember I said the value is basically referring to the selected item.

87
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.300
So over here we're going to pass in the value of whatever the user selected the case controller and

88
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.230
that's save.

89
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.420
Okay.

90
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.960
And now we are currently in the kids but you can see we are currently in box about said the selected

91
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.010
item is going to have a color a background color of white so you can see that that is the last and we

92
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.770
can just scroll up you can see seems good whites kids and the via.

93
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.960
So what does we basically do?

94
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.670
First of all, it's going to look over each category item we have and it's going to set it to force.

95
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.230
And whenever we click on the high end, it's going to set it to true.

96
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.260
And you can see over here we are basically having a check.

97
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.840
We are saying if it is equal to true, we then want to use the white color.

98
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.890
Right.

99
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.500
So therefore, this is set to you can see currently this is this item our set to force.

100
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.310
Right.

101
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.980
And that is why it has this background color of gray shades 300.

102
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.700
And when we scroll to the women you can see the rest us then.

103
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.520
The as then been updated to force.

104
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.120
Okay hopefully understand now what we're going to need to do also is when we click on this, we want

105
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.410
to be able to change this category content.

106
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.570
We have to do that.

107
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.100
This is very easy to do.

108
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.050
To do that.

109
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.970
The Page View has a property known as controller.

110
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.080
Okay for the controller.

111
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.510
We're just going to create it over a year.

112
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.360
Video via.

113
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.620
Or we can just create it at the top and we can just go ahead and say finer and go ahead and specify

114
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.860
the type of variable, this type of page controller.

115
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.890
And we can make this a private variable in order for it not to be accessible outside this file.

116
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.250
And we can call this on the page controller, and we're going to set it to page controller.

117
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.200
Okay.

118
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.860
And now we need to bind this variable to that controller we have over there.

119
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.330
Okay.

120
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.580
Paste over here.

121
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.360
Okay.

122
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.240
And now we do not really need this over here or this.

123
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.800
Yes.

124
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.530
Right.

125
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.330
Hopefully understand.

126
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.290
You can see we basically have it over here.

127
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.320
And for the now.

128
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.760
And that is why whenever we scroll up this way, it's going to update this.

129
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.060
Right.

130
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.620
Okay.

131
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.820
So over here.

132
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.740
We are going to call the underscore.

133
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.220
Page.

134
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.360
Controller and we are going to say dot jump.

135
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.250
To page.

136
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.330
And we're going to pass the index.

137
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.460
Okay.

138
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.450
Great.

139
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.570
This controller or we can just restart this.

140
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.520
Remember, the index is basically referring to each item we have on our list.

141
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.280
So this can be one.

142
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.280
So it is good.

143
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.740
This can't be one, two, 3456 or zero one to intense.

144
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.210
Normally start from zero.

145
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.669
So this item is zero.

146
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.500
One, two, three, four.

147
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:35.340
Right.

148
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.070
So that is what the index is basically referring to.
