00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.210
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.130
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.640
In this lecture, we're going to have a test which adds over year.

4
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.840
Okay, then in that to do this, we're going to need to go back to Our Vinci Code and then the meeting

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.290
on the second screen, and then we can use country and B in order to make this way.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.070
Okay.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.140
Now over here, we're going to need to add it.

8
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.770
A newcomer.

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.940
In order to know where the rule ends, I can now use control and say, okay.

10
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.580
Now, if you should ask this, this, which is we've seen the role.

11
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.180
That means we're going to have that test at the right site.

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.920
Right.

13
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.210
Because whenever you are using eroded scrap all your widgets, it means we want to display the root

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
widgets or we don't have the is from left to right.

15
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.390
Okay.

16
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.870
So all we can do is we can copy from this row to the end and then use control and see.

17
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.130
Right.

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.880
And now we can use a column, widget column.

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.260
Okay.

20
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.840
As you know, this column widgets can take multiple widgets such as the property.

21
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.970
And the first chart is going to be that row.

22
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.660
Right.

23
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.070
Okay.

24
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.640
Okay.

25
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.360
Now, what we're going to need to do is to come back from this row.

26
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.450
Okay.

27
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.430
You can sit and see.

28
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.620
And now what's in the column?

29
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.330
What's outside the row?

30
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.270
We can then have an expanded widget.

31
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.120
The reason for this expanded widget is because we want in this widget we are going to be using to take

32
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.890
the available space and the child is going to be a test widget.

33
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.190
And is just going to say create, slash, join.

34
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.070
Mittens.

35
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.980
Well, it's just a cleats, okay?

36
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.300
I don't really care.

37
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.850
How did you corner and Obama as well?

38
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.320
I mean, that's a very, very good format.

39
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.880
Now go check it out.

40
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.440
Look, are you going to sit over there?

41
00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.590
Now, what we can do is we can then highlight this test and use controlling dots and repeat with the

42
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.100
center.

43
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.350
Okay.

44
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.340
And check if you're going to see the value now.

45
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.470
Now, what we can do.

46
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.780
As you know, the test property has a property known as Ty or you can just see the test widget has the

47
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.830
property known as Thor and there's going to be test Ty.

48
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.860
Test.

49
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.850
Stay.

50
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.620
Okay.

51
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.220
First of all, we can increase the size of the test and we can see 20 how to truly comment and go check

52
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.640
it out.

53
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.150
Okay.

54
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.640
And now we can't increase the fonts.

55
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.230
We can't see font sweet.

56
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.000
This is going to be fonts.

57
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.710
Which dots?

58
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.130
But.

59
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.070
Or we can just say w.

60
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.890
500.

61
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.220
We don't want you to be that boat.

62
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.400
Okay.

63
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.270
You're going to see it now.

64
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.060
Okay, great.

65
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.750
Now, what we can also do is we can make all this icons clickable.

66
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.830
Okay, not to do this, we're gonna need to go back to the design for each icon that is the reusable

67
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.880
icon widgets.

68
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.000
And now we can then use contra and B not to make all this icon clickable.

69
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.280
We are going to need to wrap this container with a button.

70
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.220
And to do that over here, you need to highlight a user control and that's their wrap with widgets.

71
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.540
Now going to wrap this.

72
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.240
Continue with the botting.

73
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.120
Known as gesture dictator.

74
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.130
This gesture detector has a property known as on tap.

75
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.610
Okay, now we can also make this dynamic.

76
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.730
So over here we can create a fine overview and you can call the variable on crest.

77
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.510
And as well we can specify the type.

78
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.810
It is a type of void callback, which is a function.

79
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.250
And over here we can then see this.

80
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.380
Dots are pressed.

81
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.630
We can either make it required.

82
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.320
So whenever we call this fire, which we are already doing, we're going to need to pass in the value

83
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.940
that is going to be a must.

84
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.120
We can as well see, we don't really need to pass in the value I had in the logic, which simply means

85
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.220
it can be empty or it can be not.

86
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.960
What we're just going to pass a value to it.

87
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.790
That is, it is going to be in loss to pass a value to it.

88
00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.720
And over here rule and then call the rest.

89
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.000
Okay.

90
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.090
Definitely going to have some errors because we made it a request to.

91
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.110
So we are going to need to pass the value to all of this.

92
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.860
Okay.

93
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.520
So over here.

94
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.550
We can then say oppressed and this is a function and 40 now we can say print new.

95
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.510
You.

96
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.630
Methane.

97
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.860
Okay.

98
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.890
Okay as well.

99
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.150
You can see I pressed.

100
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.290
And we can see print.

101
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.660
John.

102
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.620
Martin.

103
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.260
Continue to be okay and we can just leave this empty.

104
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.070
Okay.

105
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.860
And as well.

106
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.740
Okay.

107
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.500
Okay, now let's check it out.

108
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.340
Or we can either do this or put our Terminator and then the Borg console and.

109
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.200
Beyond on this.

110
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.610
I just think we need new mittens.

111
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.470
You can see it over here.

112
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.170
Definitely.

113
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.880
We we are not meeting in the paint for those two.

114
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.440
And you can see.

115
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.930
Just like the cable.

116
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.400
Okay.

117
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.120
Okay, guys, see you in in this lecture.
