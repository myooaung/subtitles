00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.800
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.860
Now, this lecture, we're going to make all this clickable, okay?

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.630
Now we're going to go back to our visit code now to make that clickable.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.410
What you're going to do first is you're going to create a variable and we're going to call this variable

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.540
page and it's then you're going to set it to zero.

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.940
Okay.

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.580
Now you can see it wants us to give you a type.

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.610
So this is the type of event, right?

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.990
Okay, great.

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.850
Now, what we can also do is instead of using this bottom navigation bar, we can use the Cupertino

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.120
tab in order to get the high with.

13
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.050
Okay.

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.930
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get rid of this bottom navigation bar.

15
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.010
Then you're going to set this should be cool pie.

16
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.640
See?

17
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.060
No.

18
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.460
Top bar.

19
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.780
Okay, great.

20
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.120
Now let's use contra and ask for us to save and see.

21
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.310
I'd like.

22
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.910
Okay.

23
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.720
Now, is it of this background call over here?

24
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.280
We're just going to move it.

25
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.900
It wants us to pass the background column in this casino tab.

26
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.370
Okay, so I'm going to break this down.

27
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.390
They're going to say background, color, background.

28
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.880
Hello.

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.120
Yeah.

30
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.400
Okay, that's for the black.

31
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.870
Alright?

32
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.270
Okay.

33
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.150
Great.

34
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
We can now go check it out.

35
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.700
Okay.

36
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.430
I'm just going to.

37
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.200
I'd like.

38
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.550
They're going to break this down.

39
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.060
Okay.

40
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.310
Now what you can also do.

41
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.100
You can see currently it is not applicable and the selected icon is showing green.

42
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.180
We cannot change this to.

43
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.370
So it's in us that's this.

44
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.470
We don't want the active color to be green.

45
00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.420
Okay.

46
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.090
So what you can do, the Cupertino tap has something on that active color.

47
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.410
So you're going to see colors.

48
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.460
That's why it's.

49
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:10.310
Okay.

50
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.830
Go check it out now.

51
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.520
Okay.

52
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.700
You can see currently is white.

53
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.740
We can also see all this and that's if colors two should take the white color.

54
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.820
So we can see in active color.

55
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.090
This should be as close to white.

56
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.700
If you go check it out now.

57
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.130
Okay.

58
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.550
Great.

59
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.510
You can see it now similar to the other.

60
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.930
Okay.

61
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.980
You can just leave yours to that prototype of instead of using this capacitor top.

62
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.030
Okay.

63
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.930
Really?

64
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.520
Like I said, you don't need to follow everything I'm doing.

65
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.940
You can just go with your own style.

66
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.570
Okay.

67
00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.100
Now, we have created this page in Desirable and we've said you should be quick to zero.

68
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.330
Say for that.

69
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.750
The reason for this is we want to make this clickable.

70
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.110
You can see currently it is not clickable.

71
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.070
Right.

72
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.190
So now what you're going to do next is.

73
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.850
We tend to compare two notable features in the water navigation but is still going to be the same.

74
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.990
Okay, so the past is something known as the on tap.

75
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.370
Okay.

76
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.590
Then we're going to create a function.

77
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.790
Okay.

78
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.350
Now over this parentheses, you're going to pass something on us in dance, which is different to the

79
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.130
starting point.

80
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.920
Okay.

81
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.930
Now.

82
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.890
We are going to test it.

83
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.320
But, you know, we can't suggest it isn't is that this we did that is we can't update the UI when we

84
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320
are using what is it less widgets.

85
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.690
Okay.

86
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.450
So what are going to do for us and that's the use is tested, we need to use it for with it.

87
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.190
So this is the tool that we can easily just highlight this first.

88
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.620
Then we're going to use control and dots.

89
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.190
They were able to go to court, but to state who did?

90
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.080
Okay, now we can use the state food aid now.

91
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.520
Okay.

92
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.240
Then we can set it.

93
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.760
Okay.

94
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.290
So it is going to be page and this is equal to the this in this way.

95
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.870
Okay.

96
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.940
So what you are trying to say is, first of all, we created a variable called page in this.

97
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.940
Then we set it to zero.

98
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.170
We should be the.

99
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.370
All right.

100
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.910
Okay.

101
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.170
So what's it is?

102
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.810
Big League is going to admit that it has to.

103
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.790
So this is going to be one of sorts of it's the indies to something different once each are being clicked.

104
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.320
Well, for the starter point, it's going to be zero.

105
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.270
We should be what?

106
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.310
The whole page.

107
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.680
Okay.

108
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.510
Grids now to make this clickable.

109
00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.790
Now, the next thing we're going to do is in something that's covered in this is to host the place we

110
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.170
are currently in.

111
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.290
So we are going to pass in the courage index.

112
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.370
Then we're going to see it should be the page index, which is as at now it should be zero.

113
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.650
Well, once it is click is going to update its to one, two, three and so on.

114
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.560
Okay, so this is basically it.

115
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.130
Okay.

116
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.150
Control this to save.

117
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.000
Okay.

118
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.550
Now, really, you can't see this.

119
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.950
So what you can do is as of this.

120
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.680
Active caller we can change it to a pink for now so we can see if it is not applicable.

121
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.390
Okay.

122
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.310
Okay.

123
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.390
Now you can see this.

124
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.740
Okay, great.

125
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.860
So you can see now it is now clickable, right?

126
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.280
Okay.

127
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.170
Great.

128
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.190
So now in in this lecture, they're going to be able to navigate between pages.

129
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.410
So I'll click on this.

130
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.210
It's going to take us to the whole page.

131
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.570
When you click on field, it's going to take us to the first page when we click on stage cause, upload

132
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.250
and profile.

133
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.880
It's going to take us to those pages.

134
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.230
Okay, so that is what they're going to be doing in the next lecture.

135
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.850
Okay, guys, see you.
