00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.670
In this lecture, we are finally going to display the price of the products.

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.020
Now, what we can do is we can wrap this test with that with a column in order to accept another widget

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.080
which is going to be displayed vertically.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.220
Column.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.560
Okay.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.350
And now we can have another test widget.

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.230
And this is going to be called provider.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.890
Cut provider, dot get items.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.880
And we want to assess each item by the index and we just want to assess the price.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.350
And this is a double.

13
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.750
So what we have to say is to.

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:53.610
The string us fixed and we can just say we need to fraction digits how to train Comair and use controller

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.760
and has to save and go check this out.

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.120
You're going to see it all right now.

17
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.480
And what we can also do is within the column, we can then say cross assist, element, cross assist.

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.870
Cross us this element that.

19
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.070
The start.

20
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.220
You're going to say it over here now.

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.540
Okay.

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.750
And what we can also do.

23
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080
We can make this to excess.

24
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.600
We just have equal space to do this.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.720
We can then say main axis element.

26
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.640
And this is going to be main axis alignment dot space heavily to distribute equal space between both

27
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.360
widgets.

28
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.090
She said right now with equal spaces.

29
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.750
And we could also see this and this is going to be test style.

30
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.830
We can give you a call or maybe call us design or whatsoever color you prefer.

31
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.800
And this controller and has to save.

32
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.740
Okay.

33
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.210
And you should see that.

34
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.200
Okay.

35
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.160
Or maybe we could also say maybe later space and maybe one night and we'll see how it's going to look

36
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.700
like.

37
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.100
Okay.

38
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.990
Okay.

39
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.080
Okay, guys, see you.

40
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.870
And in this lecture.
