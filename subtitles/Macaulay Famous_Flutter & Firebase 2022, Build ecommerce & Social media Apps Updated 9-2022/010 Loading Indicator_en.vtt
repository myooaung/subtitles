00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.740
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.290
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.360
Now you can see the password reset link as the sense because they follow this link to reset your credit.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.350
This is the password for your my colleague famous email that's called accounts.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.320
Now when you click on this link, it's going to take you to where you're going to reset your password.

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.380
Okay.

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.740
Great.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.200
You can see to where we set a password for Macaulay.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.680
Film us.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.759
Okay, great.

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.750
Because is it?

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.700
Okay.

13
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.350
Now, what you're going to do now is.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.840
We are going to make this.

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.790
Once we click on this, it's going to start loaded.

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460
You can see plus a link has been sent to the address.

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.570
Okay.

18
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.470
I'm just going to check.

19
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.190
Let's look for this in this.

20
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.410
Right.

21
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.350
You can see the way.

22
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.410
Right.

23
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.830
Okay.

24
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.250
So now what you're going to do now is when we click on this once I have a loading screen.

25
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.060
Right.

26
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.520
So let's go back to our code.

27
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.540
Okay.

28
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.070
Just to remove this.

29
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.480
Okay.

30
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.760
Now, what they're going to do is.

31
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.850
Okay.

32
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.970
You said it before.

33
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.710
So you can just try to pose this video and see if you can implement it by ourselves.

34
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.640
So you must start the process, right?

35
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.000
Okay.

36
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.460
So now we're going to create a variable.

37
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.700
They're going to create a variable called underscore is loaded is going to be required to force.

38
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.930
Right.

39
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.610
You can see it wants us to pass the time.

40
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.250
So this is the true or false value.

41
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.230
So it is going to be a type of.

42
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.150
Oh.

43
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.950
Okay.

44
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.180
Now what you can do is.

45
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.160
Well, that is function.

46
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.930
The other necessitates.

47
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.190
Then I'm going to say underscore it's loaded is equal to true enough to get the loaded spinner.

48
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.950
So all of this function is triggered is going to start immediately to load that I to send the password.

49
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.920
It's that link to the user then.

50
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.390
I'm going to say it again.

51
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.100
Then they're going to say the school is loading is required to pass.

52
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.420
Okay.

53
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.880
Right.

54
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.640
Semicolon.

55
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.900
Okay.

56
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.760
They're going to hide it away.

57
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.920
So this is all right.

58
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.280
Okay.

59
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.210
So you're going to see.

60
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.190
On this call, a slowdown.

61
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.060
That is if on the scoreboard it is equal to true.

62
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.190
Then once this is set to which it is going to Saint-Denis, we get what we want to add.

63
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.740
So for the charge is going to be circular.

64
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.300
Progress indicator.

65
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.040
You can give it color.

66
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.770
Since the background is black, we can give you a color of colors.

67
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.260
That's why it's okay.

68
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.580
Then else.

69
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.420
We just had the initial showing that.

70
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.150
Okay.

71
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.430
I think we are missing.

72
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.820
One parenthesis.

73
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.220
Okay.

74
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.050
Yes.

75
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.790
Control this not to save.

76
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.250
Okay.

77
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.810
Ack ack ack ack ack.

78
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.640
Great.

79
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.450
Now.

80
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.570
Let's click on this.

81
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.700
Okay.

82
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.860
Great says what can look like as we said.

83
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
So your sense of the email address right.

84
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.170
You're going see it here.

85
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.280
I think it does not come because of a network issue.

86
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.950
So that's just basically it's right.
