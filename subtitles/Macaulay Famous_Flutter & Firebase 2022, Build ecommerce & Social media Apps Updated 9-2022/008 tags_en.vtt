1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.770
Worker in this is that you are going to create this to tax that is the woman t shirt and dress.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
Okay now to do this again needs to go back to the recycled.

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.500
Now what you can do is over this widget, we can create a new fly.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.590
And I'm just going to call this fly tag.

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.010
Least than the addiction which is thought that okay we can use contribute a bit to make this wait and

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.360
see is not is going to change.

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.189
We can use this tip this widget.

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.030
Okay as well.

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.400
We can call this tag list.

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.160
And over here we're going to need to highlight and use control and DOT in order to import the matter

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.060
out of that package.

12
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.540
Okay.

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.780
Now, you can see all the stocks have been displayed horizontally.

14
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.220
That is from left to right.

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.930
So we are going to be using a widget we should know as row.

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.920
Okay.

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.410
Great.

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.200
Nice though.

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.180
This container you're going to get rid of this container then is just going to return it more widgets.

20
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.990
Now, before we continue, what we can do is we can create a variable to hold this.

21
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.480
Thanks.

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.610
Okay.

23
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.190
Now where we can create a finer variable, then we can call this variable.

24
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.180
So this is going to be equal to at least.

25
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.870
Now the first value we have is the woman.

26
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.790
Then the second value we have is the t shirts.

27
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.260
And lastly, the last value we have is the dress.

28
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.550
Okay.

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.460
I'll just leave it on.

30
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.570
Okay, great.

31
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.870
Now, as you know, this road that can take in multiple widgets.

32
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.590
Right.

33
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.270
So it has the children.

34
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.290
Okay.

35
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.750
Now, also gathered on this is we're going to map over this list, not the mark of this rebel that needs

36
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.140
to get rid of this racket.

37
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.230
Okay.

38
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.690
Now, I'll just have to say, is this variable called sideways track?

39
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.110
This then dots map.

40
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.680
Okay.

41
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.900
Now, over here are going to return.

42
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.900
The container.

43
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.330
The reason for that is so we have access to some additional property such as.

44
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.960
Pardon?

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.900
Okay.

46
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.040
Now what you can just do can then provide this.

47
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.970
Congrats.

48
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.080
That's so at least.

49
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.720
Okay, great.

50
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:41.150
By the way, now we can break this down, then we can have a chat.

51
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.600
Which is going to be a test which at.

52
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.670
Right.

53
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.660
Then we can pass in the E.

54
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.230
Okay.

55
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.510
How to treat a coma.

56
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.520
Just control this to save, then control a B to make this smaller.

57
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.120
Then we're going to go to the homescreen.

58
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.500
Right.

59
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.150
Then, however you rebel, they import that list.

60
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.010
Right.

61
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.830
Tablets.

62
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.550
Okay.

63
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.230
Is control necessary now?

64
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.520
And go check it out.

65
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.190
Okay.

66
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.730
Now you can see away, right?

67
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.110
Okay.

68
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.150
Now what you can do.

69
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.130
We can give some padding and margin for this sub list.

70
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.270
So over here we can give a pardon is going to be pardoned.

71
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.460
There's going to be hedge assets.

72
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.560
That's all for all sides.

73
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.970
But we are just going to give ten.

74
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.500
All right.

75
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.700
I've done this to save.

76
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.010
And go check it out now.

77
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.750
Okay.

78
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.470
Good.

79
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.730
Now, what we can also do is we can.

80
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.970
Give the side to the test.

81
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.590
So it is going to be satisfied.

82
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.330
It's going to be test stay.

83
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.720
Okay we can give a color is definitely colors that gray.

84
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.040
Okay.

85
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.330
Let's think.

86
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.170
Okay.

87
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.200
Now what you can also do.

88
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.910
We can.

89
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.839
You can give a background color to this.

90
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.720
So not to do that, I just have to say is decoration is going to be box decoration, right?

91
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.200
Okay.

92
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.930
Then we can give a.

93
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.750
A background color so we can just see colors that.

94
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.960
Yellow accents.

95
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.100
Okay, great.

96
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.950
Check it out now to see what it does.

97
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.430
Okay, great.

98
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.420
Now we can give some space between each member of the margin as to do it outside, right?

99
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.020
So we can also get within the container.

100
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.670
You can see margin is going to be edge and says.

101
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.120
And sets and sets.

102
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.760
Edge insists that all.

103
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.510
Ten.

104
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.300
As all contenders to see.

105
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.180
Then go check it out.

106
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.550
Okay.

107
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.920
Great.

108
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.960
Now we can make this round, right?

109
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.220
I'd be trying to do that.

110
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.250
I think you can do that now.

111
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.620
Right.

112
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.010
Okay.

113
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.400
So you're going to be using the property within the force declaration card border radius.

114
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.690
Right.

115
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.760
So we can't see.

116
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.940
But if we use.

117
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.950
What are we doing?

118
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.610
The circle of ten.

119
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.150
Okay.

120
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.410
I'll try to save.

121
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.350
Go check it out.

122
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.600
Okay.

123
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.140
Great.

124
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.330
Now we can just make this.

125
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.550
Okay.

126
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.160
Ten is okay from the 14.

127
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.810
Then maybe we should just use the black to see who's going to look like.

128
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.390
The AK.

129
00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.040
Okay.

130
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.990
I think it looks weird.

131
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.110
Or probably you can live just like that.

132
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.880
I'm just going to get rid of this.

133
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.620
I'm just trying to show you how to do that.

134
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.200
Okay, we're going to get rid of this declaration.

135
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.980
Both the commission.

136
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.310
Thank you, Mr. Sumpter.

137
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.570
Okay.

138
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.430
Yeah.

139
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.270
So get rid of this.

140
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.950
There's a safe.

141
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.420
Okay.

142
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.230
Great.

143
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.090
Looking nice, right?

144
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.700
Okay.
