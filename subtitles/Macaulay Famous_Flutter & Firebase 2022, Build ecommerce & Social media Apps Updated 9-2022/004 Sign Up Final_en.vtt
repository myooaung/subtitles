00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.009
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.210
Now, what are we going to be doing?

4
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.760
This lecture is we're going to have to test widgets, and those two tests widgets are going to be displayed

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.950
or recently that is from left to right.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.680
Okay.

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.960
Now, in order to do this, we're going to need to go back to voice code and now we can use control

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.460
and B to make this wide.

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.270
Okay?

10
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
Now we can simply just do this within the.

11
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.440
Test Fields column.

12
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.960
So we know this column has to do with everything that has to do with our test field and sign up like

13
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.030
so we tend to column it ends over.

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.320
Yeah.

15
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.270
And this is the last.

16
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.140
Consider we have for the button rights.

17
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.710
Okay.

18
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.360
So over here we can have a row with that, because what we simply want is we want the test over here,

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.300
which is going to say, I already have an account and it says over here, which is then going to say

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.140
Log in.

21
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.099
Okay.

22
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.770
So for this purpose, we're going to be needing a row widgets.

23
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.360
And as you know, a row can take multiple widgets.

24
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.280
So it's as these children as property.

25
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.930
And the first child is going to be a test widget, which is which is just going to say already.

26
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.140
Have.

27
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.480
And accounts.

28
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.570
We can have a question mark to this and how to try to cover how to try to cover this country and save.

29
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.840
You can see it via.

30
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.390
Okay.

31
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.500
That we can take it to the middle.

32
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.090
Now, over this row, jets, the row has a property known as main access elements, which is going to

33
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.160
be the opposite of column.

34
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.870
So we can say.

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.810
Or which is going to work as the opposite of cola.

36
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.530
Okay.

37
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.210
So now we can say main element or center.

38
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.449
So this is going to take you to the center board for COLA.

39
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.900
This is going to take you to the center vertically.

40
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.140
You can see it over here.

41
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.030
So he took it to the center.

42
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.180
A result, sadly.

43
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.890
But for Colon, it's going to take it to the center vertically.

44
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.120
Okay.

45
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.070
So we can then have another child.

46
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.080
And for the other child, it's going to be a widget known as test button because we want the button

47
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.220
to be clickable.

48
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.350
Or you can easily just drop that button.

49
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.120
You can easily just wrap the test with a button or you can just go with this.

50
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.090
Okay.

51
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.540
And as you know, this is going to take the art press, which is a function.

52
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.140
And for the child, it's going to be a test widget.

53
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.710
And it's just going to say log in.

54
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.510
How to trachoma and use comprehensive.

55
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.160
You can see it over here.

56
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.540
Okay, great.

57
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.530
And what we can do now is to study this a bit.

58
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.160
And as you know, the test widget has a property known as Ty.

59
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.930
And this is going to be test.

60
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.610
We can increase the font size to 18 and see how it's going to look.

61
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.160
And we can then say font width and it's going to be full width.

62
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.200
That board, or we can say we don't want it to be that board.

63
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.910
So we can say the W.

64
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.050
Several hundred OC.

65
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.000
Okay.

66
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.750
Great.

67
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.130
Already have.

68
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.200
We can just use a small letter.

69
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.330
Already have an account.

70
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.230
Then log in.

71
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.710
Okay.

72
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.330
Great.

73
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.880
Now, what we can also do is.

74
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.160
We any widgets we have had in this is going to be over.

75
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.150
That is any widgets.

76
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.830
We are hardened within the row.

77
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.520
It's going to be at this point of view.

78
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:22.240
So what we can do is outside this row widgets, we can it's NCA, we can have it says widgets.

79
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.290
Wishes good wishes going to say.

80
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.760
How did your is controlled and save and see.

81
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.260
So it's going to be a.

82
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.670
For.

83
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.910
Okay.

84
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.040
We can't just go ahead and start this first.

85
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.590
So there's going to be test tie.

86
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:53.030
And we can say fonts size of 22 and font suite is going to be four width.

87
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.350
The board is controlled to save.

88
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.400
Okay.

89
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:11.090
Or that we can basically just copy this rule we have over here again and paste this.

90
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.470
We are still within the Test Fields column.

91
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.840
Right.

92
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.430
You can see this is it.

93
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.630
And this is the main column we have that wraps everything up.

94
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.120
Okay.

95
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.570
So we can piece this here.

96
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.330
Ah.

97
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.430
This is going to be.

98
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.170
Okay.

99
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.570
Create.

100
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.990
We can just say create a seller.

101
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.390
SLR.

102
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.020
Like, all we can basically do is we can use.

103
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.100
Double quotes and we can say creates a seller's.

104
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.640
Seller.

105
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.170
So single quotes.

106
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.150
The seller's accounts.

107
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.870
Okay.

108
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.550
And this is going to be this is going to say sign up like.

109
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.370
Great.

110
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.110
Okay, now let's check it out and see.

111
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.160
Create a seller account, create a seller's account.

112
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.230
We can increase the font size to 22 for this.

113
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.020
Okay.

114
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.790
And we can basically reduce this to the 500.

115
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.520
And as well.

116
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.180
Okay.

117
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.600
500.

118
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.870
Hopefully you understand our role in the works, but if you don't, you can do well to let me know.

119
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.860
So I'm going to make a video personally for you in order to explain more.

120
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.870
Deportee.

121
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.830
Are you okay?

122
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.770
You can see.

123
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.770
Okay.

124
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.710
In the future, we are going to be using funds.

125
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.070
So this test are going to look very, very nice.

126
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.220
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
