00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.780
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.150
Walker naturally thought this was a network issue, but it is not.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.170
Now, we also need to use the network image of our detail page.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.620
Right.

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.010
Okay.

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.980
Now we're going to need to go to the detailed directory.

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.990
This is the detailed directory of it and then the detail page.

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.400
Okay.

9
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.170
Now, although we are we are using the network image.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.670
So with the assets image, we are going to change it to network.

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.390
So let's work in Asia.

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.710
Okay.

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.360
Now, Haaz, you started this.

14
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.660
As well.

15
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.270
We're going to need to do the same thing for the car screen.

16
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.430
Okay.

17
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.170
We're going to need to go to the for the design for each car.

18
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.560
Okay.

19
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.600
That is the cost item.

20
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.330
Okay.

21
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.910
As long I can look for where where is in the assets image.

22
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.270
Okay.

23
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.940
And I'm going to interchange this to network.

24
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.750
Image.

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.200
Okay.

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.770
Right.

27
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.970
Okay.

28
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.900
Let's walk in there.

29
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.350
Okay.

30
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.069
Think this.

31
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.430
Okay.

32
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.100
Okay.

33
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.820
I'll just add this now and.

34
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.640
Everton's.

35
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.040
No walk.

36
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.940
Just five.

37
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.130
Therefore that arrow you can look forward to call the it's actually sue is going to be displayed at

38
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.550
our screen that's why I see that is you're going to need to look for the root file.

39
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.940
Right.

40
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.350
Okay.

41
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.940
But I think I'm just going to sort that out later.

42
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.380
Okay.

43
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.420
Now, what is basically been displayed in the field suggest that it has not been displayed ads.

44
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.960
So it has not been displayed in the new I have at once.

45
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.160
We're going to see it in the field screen immediately.

46
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.530
Okay.

47
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.790
Now click on this.

48
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.570
Okay.

49
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.560
Now you can see it is now working properly.

50
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.930
Okay.

51
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.240
Now go to the cards.

52
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.590
Okay.

53
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.420
You can see it now.

54
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.860
Okay.

55
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.500
Great.

56
00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.410
Okay.

57
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.730
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
