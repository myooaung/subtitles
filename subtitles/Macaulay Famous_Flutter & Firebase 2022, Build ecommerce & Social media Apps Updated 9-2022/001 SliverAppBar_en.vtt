00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.350
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.939
In this lecture, we're going to start designing the profile screen.

4
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.560
Okay?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.140
Now, over this views directory, we are going to create a new file and we're going to call this file

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.140
profile on the score screen.

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.480
And then the extension is the dots.

8
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.200
And what we can do, we can use control and beat to make this wide.

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.380
In the future, we are going to be able to update the UI.

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.420
So we're going to need to go with a stateful widget and over the profile screen.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.310
And now we have to alight and use control and dot in order to impart the material to that package.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.540
Now, instead of returning a container, we're going to return a scaffold in order to have access to

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.250
lots of properties.

14
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.750
Scaffold.

15
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.390
And as you know, the scaffold has a property known as body.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.150
And for the body we can use this which is not seen before, which is known as custom.

17
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.160
Scroll view.

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.820
This is similar to that of the single child scroll view.

19
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.540
What you're basically saying is we want to be able to scroll this page.

20
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.260
Now the custom scroll view has a property known as Sivas, which is a list.

21
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.130
Okay.

22
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.210
And now the first thing we're going to need to do is to have an high bar.

23
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.110
Since we're using this custom scroll view, the high bar is not going to be this type of bar, which

24
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.090
we know is going to be something known as savers.

25
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.070
Hub bar.

26
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.360
Okay.

27
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.790
And what we can do is control.

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.870
Let's save this file and we're going to need to go to the customer home screen.

29
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.190
And instead of this sensor, we can get rid of this and use that screen.

30
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:12.630
We just created a profile screen and had you turn the camera and now we have to hold restart this.

31
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.420
Okay.

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.430
We have to wait for the process.

33
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.080
They performing or to start?

34
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.270
Well it's we started and we have to go to I think it has to also start this app profile screen and you

35
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.430
can see to where but you can see we have this status bar.

36
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.180
We can get rid of that.

37
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.090
In order to do that, we have to go to the main to that file and before the material have.

38
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.040
That is, we send the widget viewed.

39
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.700
It has a property known as system.

40
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.090
Chrome.

41
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.620
Then we can then say sets.

42
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.560
Over.

43
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.690
Set system UI over this time.

44
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.780
This is going to be system.

45
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.460
Over.

46
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.740
I think hopefully I've forgotten this.

47
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.530
System.

48
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.790
Over this time system, you are the same system you are over this time, and we're going to set the

49
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.380
starters by color.

50
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.290
This is going to be colors, dots.

51
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.980
The Transparent OC had the chain of command.

52
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.560
This is what we are basically trying to get rid of.

53
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.000
Hopefully you can see this.

54
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.820
OC what we start.

55
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.300
So not still a sense, but transparent.

56
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.220
Trust parent.

57
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.020
Okay.

58
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.340
Probably you can use red in order to see that.

59
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.110
More like we can just get to have to start.

60
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.660
Okay.

61
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.540
Or we start.

62
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.200
Sorry.

63
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.930
And you're not going to see that again.

64
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.600
Because it's still currently and we have to how to start this.

65
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.120
Okay.

66
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.910
Okay.

67
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.100
It's going right and go check for.

68
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.240
Okay.

69
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.680
You can no longer see this.

70
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.190
Okay.

71
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.170
Back to the profile screen.

72
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.870
What's in the Silver Harbor.

73
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.060
We can specify the height of the harbor.

74
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.460
We can say this is way too short and we want to increase it.

75
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.290
Remember how high it has.

76
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.230
Remember, height has to do with how long it's going to be.

77
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.180
Okay, so now the Silver Harbor has a property known as expanded height.

78
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.680
What we can do, we can set this to 140.

79
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.300
Okay.

80
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.830
Okay, great.

81
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.950
And now we can then continue.

82
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.200
Over here, we're going to have a test which is going to say accounts.

83
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.490
So to do that, the Silver Harbor has a property known as flexible space.

84
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.250
And since we're going to return basically a test, this is going to be a layout builder.

85
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.960
The layout view that takes in something known as builder and as you know, the builder will always take

86
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.040
in context.

87
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.360
And it's going to take in an additional capacity, which is known as constraints and which has to do

88
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.230
with heights.

89
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.100
Course strings.

90
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.070
Okay.

91
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.610
Then we can then return.

92
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.040
We tried something known as flexible.

93
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.310
Flexible.

94
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.450
Flexible.

95
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.600
Spacebar.

96
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.710
Okay, flexible spacebar.

97
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.570
Okay.

98
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.240
And now we can have a test and not to have that.

99
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.650
We're going to have the title.

100
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.970
Remember, this is more like an apple, but in a different dimension.

101
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.090
Okay.

102
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.580
Now therefore the title.

103
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.130
What we want is if the user.

104
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.870
Is if the user as screw that is being able to scroll this way, the test is going to show off.

105
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.600
Then if the user scroll below, it's going to get disappeared.

106
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.390
Not to do that, we're going to use a widget which is known as and the.

107
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.330
Animated.

108
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.540
Opacity.

109
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.410
And you can see this text in some few arguments.

110
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.410
It takes in the opacity and for the opacity.

111
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.080
Or we can say we can have a check.

112
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.380
We can then say constraints.

113
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.720
This constraints will just pass in the constraints dot biggest.

114
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.440
Biggest, if it is.

115
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.840
Lesser done.

116
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.730
So don't hide.

117
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.160
And now we can say if it is lesser done.

118
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.250
Once we see, then we want to show it.

119
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.150
So, Bahar, then one over here.

120
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.930
Else.

121
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.830
We do not want to show it anymore.

122
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.460
You're going to see this in action or fortunately, we are not going to be able to scroll for Android

123
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.190
because in order for us to scroll, we need to have multiple widgets over here.

124
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.850
But since we do not have, we won't be able to scroll this page currently.

125
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.030
But if you are on highways, I think you should be able to scroll this page right now.

126
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.560
Okay.

127
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:53.110
But in Android, once we start having multiple widgets, definitely we are going to be able to scroll

128
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.260
this page and you're going to see what I'm trying to say.

129
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.910
Okay.

130
00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.860
So you just have to wait.

131
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.800
Okay.

132
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.130
And we can add some animation over here.

133
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.520
So this is going to be duration.

134
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.770
And it's going to be milliseconds.

135
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:16.290
That is how fast we want it to go off or how fast or how fast we want it to be displayed.

136
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.360
Okay.

137
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:17.970
And.

138
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.260
This is milliseconds.

139
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.300
We can set this to maybe 200.

140
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.170
Okay.

141
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.280
I think we need.

142
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.420
This way.

143
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.590
And finally.

144
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.539
The animated opacity.

145
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.659
Okay.

146
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.090
We can just have the comma.

147
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:44.590
The animated app Opacity has a property known as child.

148
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.510
That is, this child will basically say, we want to animate this test.

149
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.570
I think we could have just get rid of this and use it test.

150
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.750
Which way you can see since.

151
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.540
Good, right.

152
00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.820
I think it's nice here.

153
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.710
We could have just get rid of.

154
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:09.190
Get rid of this and just go ahead and use a test of what we want to be able to animate the test.

155
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.950
You're just going to see why we are doing this animation animated opacity variation.

156
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.860
Okay, so you just have to keep your heads crossed like a test is going to be our count.

157
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.430
Okay.

158
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.730
How'd you come out?

159
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.420
Like I said, you're not going to see this in Android currently because this page is not yet scrollable,

160
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.100
but for hours you should be able to see this right when you scroll.

161
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.770
Okay, great.

162
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:43.630
And we can change the background color of this amber in order to do that.

163
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:52.340
Outside this animated opacity within the flexible space bar, it's as a property.

164
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.820
So as a property known as background.

165
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:04.700
And for the background it can take in a widget which is a container, and we can then have a decoration,

166
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.730
a box decoration.

167
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.490
Okay.

168
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.340
And.

169
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.910
We can then have gradients.

170
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.310
This is going to be linear.

171
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.260
That's how multiple colors.

172
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.470
Lena.

173
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.470
As Billy.

174
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.540
Linear gradients.

175
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.310
Because I can spell linear.

176
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.030
Okay.

177
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.350
Linear gradients.

178
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.680
And this is going to take a list of colors.

179
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.240
Okay.

180
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:47.460
For the first color we can say it is going to be color starts cyan and the second color is going to

181
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.020
be colors dot black.

182
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.720
But you can just have any of the color you desire.

183
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.650
To use control and save and.

184
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.730
You're going to see it now.

185
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:57.800
Okay.

186
00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.790
Now let's make this more cleaner.

187
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.640
We can get rid of that default color.

188
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.700
Now we send the silver.

189
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.210
Bar.

190
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:13.470
It has the green color and we can change these two colours dot white.

191
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.230
He's trying to save.

192
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.770
Okay.

193
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.570
And as well, we can't get rid of the elevation.

194
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.980
We can set it to zero.

195
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.340
Okay.

196
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.400
Okay.

197
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.310
Sounds good, right?

198
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.970
Okay.

199
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.810
Now, like I said, you're not going to be able to see this account yet, since we are not yet able

200
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.130
to scroll for it.

201
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:45.400
The reason we are not able to scroll is because we need multiple widget in order to make this create

202
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.720
scrollable.

203
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.830
Okay.

204
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.850
Okay, guys.

205
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.410
See you in the next lecture.
