Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.920
Walker in this lecture organized for the GSA meets package.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.430
But before then, head up to pop, dot dev.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.580
And over here, we're going to need to search for GSC, MIT.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.920
Okay.

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.380
Okay.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.800
Okay.

8
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.610
Session And it's going to take some time based on your network condition.

9
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.990
Okay.

10
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.400
Then they're going to click on this first link over here.

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.950
Okay.

12
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.510
Now you can see what he does over here.

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.470
You can see that cement plug in for floating supports, hundred hours and web platforms.

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.150
Get Submit is an open source JavaScript application that uses jetski video bridge to provide high quality,

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.750
secure and scalable video conference.

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.120
Okay, so by using jetsam package, they're going to have access to lots of features.

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.680
The popular Zoom application has, if that's all fuchsia.

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.370
Okay.

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.260
So now all we can do is to copy the code and then head up to our pub deck.

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.210
But before that, we can just make sure we stop our hub from running it.

21
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.030
Because outside of this package, we're going to need to do some configurations.

22
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.890
Okay, now we can.

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.020
Okay, we can.

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.860
Then go to the pub spec that he fly.

25
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.340
Sorry.

26
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.410
I think I called it pub the dev.

27
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.740
No.

28
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.150
Okay.

29
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.190
So what we can do now is to.

30
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.210
Okay.

31
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.130
Right after.

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.680
Okay.

33
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.850
I think.

34
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.820
Okay, this is going to do this over here.

35
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.480
Okay.

36
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.210
So right after the Google signing, we can do this and use contra and necessary in order to get this

37
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.410
package that he can see.

38
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.580
Okay.

39
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.200
Now, because you start to run this app, you're going to get in there because there are some configurations

40
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.950
we need to do.

41
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.380
And so I'm going to do that in in this lecture.

42
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.890
Okay, guys, see you in a nest lecture.
