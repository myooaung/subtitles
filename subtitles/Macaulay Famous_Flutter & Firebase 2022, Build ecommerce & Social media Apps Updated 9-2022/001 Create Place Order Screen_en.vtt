00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.110
Oh, come in.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.040
This lecture, we are going to start building the place.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.060
Order screen.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.620
Now to do this, we are just going to create the screen in the minor screens directory.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.610
Within the minus screens directory, we are going to create a new file and we can call this file, check

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.260
out on the screen, or we can just call this place on the score order on the score screen and dot,

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.890
dot.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:40.620
And for now we can go with the stateless widget and place order screen and over here we can alive and

9
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.010
use control dots, import material the dots and we can just get rid of this.

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.210
Okay.

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.580
And it is this for now.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.970
We can have a color colors that sign.

13
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.200
Okay.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.660
Great.

15
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.880
And back to the cut screen.

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.170
We have this checkered wire and this is the function for it.

17
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.430
Within here we can then say navigator dot of contest or we can just go with push.

18
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.190
It's basically it's basically same.

19
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
It's a positive contest.

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.280
And for the root it is something known as materia.

21
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.170
Page rotes or out whatsoever where you pronounce it and context.

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.990
You could also specify it is a type of beauty contest or you can just leave it that way.

23
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.000
Okay.

24
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.390
And basically we want to return the place other.

25
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.060
Screen.

26
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.630
Okay.

27
00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.790
And now we need to import a light and it's concerned us and why we need a semicolon and hover in this

28
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.070
to see what we are missing.

29
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.140
We are missing an additional parenthesis.

30
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.710
Okay.

31
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.990
Use control and save.

32
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.090
And.

33
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.330
And click on the checkout button.

34
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.590
Okay, great.

35
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.780
And what about if we delete this item from our cards?

36
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.040
You can see currently our cards is empty and click on this.

37
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.010
It's going to take us to the checkout screen.

38
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.840
And this is very wrong because there is really no need of checking out if we have no products in our

39
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.500
cards.

40
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.520
Right.

41
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:49.510
So what we can do is we can have a check to see if the user has products in their cards.

42
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.100
And then holy, we should be we should be able to go to the checkout screen because this way there's

43
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.900
really no need of checking out, right?

44
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.150
Because we have no products.

45
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.400
We are checking that for right.

46
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.600
Or we have no product we are placing order for.

47
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.520
So to do this.

48
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.610
Over here, we can just check based on the total price.

49
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.570
That is, if the total price is equal to zero, then we want to disable the button and you can see we

50
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:28.220
tell the provider directory it's in the provider directory and then the card provider we have a getter

51
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.100
or a function known as total price.

52
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.330
And in order for us to assess this to the price, we first need to assess this provider class because

53
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.030
it is within the card provider class.

54
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.560
Okay.

55
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.070
To do this within the car screen.

56
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.330
Look over here before the block.

57
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.030
Remember, we cannot use the contents that wash over.

58
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.400
Okay.

59
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.060
So we can use the contest.

60
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.110
Contest.

61
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.310
Watch.

62
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.450
And sorry.

63
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:12.550
And basically we have to tell where we want to fetch data from or the data we want to use.

64
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.280
And it is from the card provider class.

65
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.320
And now we can then say to the price and we can then check if it is equal to $0 zero zero.

66
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.430
Zero.

67
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.740
You can see currently we have no item, so it is equal to 00000, which is equal to 000.

68
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.370
Then we want to disable the button by saying no else.

69
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.780
If it is not equal to zero zero then we want to navigate to the place.

70
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.730
Order screen.

71
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.260
Yes, control.

72
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.440
And that's the save.

73
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.690
And you can secretly.

74
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.440
We have no item added to our cards.

75
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.650
So the surprise is zero zero.

76
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.150
So it's going to be equal to zero zero.

77
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.440
And for this purpose, we cannot go to the checkout screen and let's try to have the product to our

78
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.100
card.

79
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.840
We're just going to hide this.

80
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.580
And you can see currently it is forced because it is no longer equal to zero zero.

81
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.410
So right now you can click on the checkout and it's going to take us to the checkout screen.

82
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.700
Okay, great.
