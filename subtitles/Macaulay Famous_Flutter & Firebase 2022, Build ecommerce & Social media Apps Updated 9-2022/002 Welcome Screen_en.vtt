00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.660
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.260
Now, when the user clicks on, log in.

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.540
If no errors, then are going to take the user to the next page.

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.170
Okay, so in this lecture, we are going to do this.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.190
Okay.

7
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.120
Now, what I asked you to do was provided the screens for the you're going to create a new fly and you're

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.420
gonna call the fi bottom up.

9
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.760
And the reason for that is because in the future, they're going to have a bottom navigation bar where

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.810
users are going to be able to easily navigate to different pages.

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.420
Okay.

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.140
So they're able to do it together in this lecture.

13
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.240
So why this crease for the middle creates a new high.

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.090
They're going to call this five bottom.

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.450
But on this call now.

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
But then the station wishes to add that.

17
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.120
Okay.

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.680
Now, I also told you to either you just add less widgets or is it more widgets?

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.360
Now we can just go with this widget for now because we can easily change it later.

20
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.530
So you can go for this widget as well.

21
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.520
You can see bottom.

22
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.890
Now Denver.

23
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.610
Right.

24
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.960
Is going to try to make this wide in over year with a large first.

25
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.490
That is true.

26
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.020
And what's in that report?

27
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.760
The material that that package.

28
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.230
Now, instead of returning just the container, we can reach on a scaffold.

29
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.400
So the advice as to loss of property like the body and others.

30
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.510
Okay.

31
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.970
So now for the now, we're just going to have a body.

32
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.600
There are other uses since our widgets are centered in this widgets.

33
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.500
Regular reason.

34
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.250
Okay.

35
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.060
Now we can have a test widgets so we can see tied to the chart is going to be a test widgets.

36
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.050
Okay.

37
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.650
For now we can just to work up.

38
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.510
Okay.

39
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.690
Now you're going to use controls to save this file.

40
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.380
Okay.

41
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.740
Now we need to take users to the next page.

42
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.120
Are clicking on log in.

43
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.580
We are taking the user to the next page.

44
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.070
That is if no heroes.

45
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.850
Okay.

46
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.680
Now we're going to go to the login screen.

47
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.900
Now I'm going to show you something.

48
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.760
Over here, we are simply saying if there is not a quarter Celsius, that's because there must be an

49
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.270
error, probably bad email format, network errors or shut password or account, not cloud or something

50
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.510
else.

51
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.960
Okay.

52
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.920
Now, if there is an error, we want to return the error in a snack bar.

53
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.060
Right.

54
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.450
Okay.

55
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.590
Now over.

56
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.640
You have an error.

57
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.860
That's mis you.

58
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:57.460
The user successfully filled in is ditches without any error, no accounts issues or any issues at all.

59
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.430
Then you're going to do some two year.

60
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.780
Right.

61
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.130
So over here we have if was is not required to sources, which means there is something wrong for the

62
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.750
spot.

63
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.910
And then there is something which I think I've said before.

64
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.140
Now the.

65
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.960
Now the gate or.

66
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.030
The off contest.

67
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.750
So now the greater good of contest.

68
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.120
Then rebels said Dutch push.

69
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.360
Coach.

70
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.780
For the roots.

71
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.660
It is like Syria, but Syria page.

72
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.080
Let's see.

73
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.700
We are teenage.

74
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.450
Roots.

75
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.170
Okay.

76
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.000
Great.

77
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.620
Now for the view there is going to be these protests.

78
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.760
Then we can see a contest.

79
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.670
Now, like I told you some of the time, it is not really necessary to pass in the time, if not, because

80
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.880
as all said, it is a type of beauty contest.

81
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.330
Right.

82
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.750
Okay.

83
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.400
Now we can either use this type of function.

84
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:16.899
If you want, you can.

85
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.300
Once you just have a function, you have to say it's on.

86
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.820
But of.

87
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.320
Now.

88
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.790
But you can see we have the bottom navigation bar as the widget, we have the bottom navigation bar

89
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.290
item as the widgets.

90
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.230
We are the boats of the navigation team as a widget.

91
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.130
So make sure you don't name your fire windows.

92
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.420
If not, you're going to get issues.

93
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.770
That was the reason I said we should.

94
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.100
Maybe it's with bottom bar because I don't think there is any widget known as bottom, even if there

95
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.920
is, but not with the shorts and every I think there should be a bottom navigation bar.

96
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.430
Okay.

97
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.930
So make sure you don't call, you'll find that name.

98
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.510
If not, you're going to get into issues.

99
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.950
Okay, so what's not bar?

100
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.010
This is our Phi.

101
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.300
Okay, great.

102
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.430
What we can do is we can add this away.

103
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.070
Now, as you remember, we remove this retard.

104
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.460
They're going to get the issue.

105
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.450
Will they?

106
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.630
Okay, so we need to had the retard.

107
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.620
Right.

108
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.230
What?

109
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.360
What we can just do.

110
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.460
We can use an arrow function.

111
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.640
So just go on.

112
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.370
Do this.

113
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.630
That's where it was before they were able to get rid of this.

114
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.080
Okay.

115
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.210
Now we can use an arrow function.

116
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.480
Then we can.

117
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.750
So once you go to the bottom.

118
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.310
But now.

119
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.030
But.

120
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.240
Okay, great.

121
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.060
Now, some of the time it is necessary to had the time and some of the time it is not.

122
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.230
In this case, it is not really necessary to have disputes contest.

123
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.370
So we can get rid of this that you're going to use contribute this to save.

124
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.510
Now what we are simply saying is over.

125
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.360
You said if race is not equal to success, that means there must be an error.

126
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.170
Or if there is error, whatever it is, there is no error.

127
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.810
Then once you go to the.

128
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.990
Bottom of the page.

129
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.390
Now, you can easily rewrite this yourself.

130
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.540
You can then say this is not equal.

131
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.490
You can say is equal to this.

132
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.590
I said, if it is equal to success, it means that there is no error.

133
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.260
Then this should be here.

134
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.640
Right.

135
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.070
So you can see if there is no error.

136
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.370
That is this.

137
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.340
Currently this is saying if there is no error, that is Israel.

138
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.310
Israel, if race is equal to so says, then we can we can just rewrite this.

139
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.850
Right.

140
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.740
So I just got a copy of this.

141
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.230
I probably think we should leave it that way.

142
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.070
Or.

143
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.240
What should we do?

144
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.650
Okay.

145
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:59.600
So we can.

146
00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.990
Yes.

147
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.330
Libertad not equal to.

148
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.740
Because if it is not equal to.

149
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.570
We want to return the error.

150
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.760
But if it is equal to that is the earth.

151
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.450
It is always the opposite of the here.

152
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.470
The here is the opposite of the house.

153
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:21.480
The house is the opposite of what the if you get it now so you can see if it is equal to its sources,

154
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.610
then you are going to go to this -- as if it is not because it's houses, which means there was an

155
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.040
error.

156
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.900
Then you're going to return this level.

157
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.010
Well, nobody has.

158
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.910
So you can easily rewrite this yourself or just leave it this way.

159
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.460
The important thing is you understand it now.

160
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.450
Okay.

161
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.580
Now that we know how to start this.

162
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.050
Okay.

163
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.990
Let's just start then we're going to go to our.

164
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.110
No, I think I have an account that is associated with an email card.

165
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.190
Had been.

166
00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:09.480
Had been hot had Gmail and Gmail that come in, which are the passwords of P E, so the E to a, y and

167
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.170
C forgetting for some reasons, I basically remove the debts of secured test.

168
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:17.680
Okay.

169
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.870
So I'm going to add that I've secured test to two.

170
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.780
Okay.

171
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.110
Okay.

172
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.610
I'm just going to type it again.

173
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.120
Probably.

174
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:40.299
I forgot to add stops to the each way and see their outlook on or it's the log in.

175
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.280
Okay, great.

176
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.840
They can see too close to what you work on page because we don't have any issues.

177
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.600
Now we can also confirm it on the evo, continue to check if really we are logged in.

178
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.230
Okay, great.

179
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.390
So you can see the way to find I did talk on this about this.

180
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.360
