1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.470
A guy's workroom.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.430
In the last lecture, we created all this fields.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.980
And in order for us to be able to use all this fields, we pass it on to the code structure.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.770
So any time we call this product class, they're going to need to pass in all this required fields.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.210
Okay.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.840
So now in this lecture, we're going to continue from where we start.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.590
Okay.

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.700
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to go to the widget directory, then we're going to go to

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.080
the fields of IS products.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.980
Right.

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.920
And over here, we can use control a bit to make this white.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.670
Okay.

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.290
Like I secretly we just read in our data statically.

14
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.320
So what you can do is you can render dynamic data.

15
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.740
Okay.

16
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.480
So over here.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.770
They're going to create a list, a list of products, your product model and against all this terrible

18
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.150
quarterly score.

19
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.780
So that's.

20
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.700
There is a core to a list.

21
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.360
Right.

22
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.670
Okay.

23
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.140
It is, right?

24
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.490
Okay.

25
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.530
Now we can then call the products model class.

26
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.330
Okay.

27
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.540
You can see is asking for the ID tie to description.

28
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.460
Price an image url for the category name.

29
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.460
Right.

30
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.780
Okay.

31
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.160
Quantity.

32
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.050
Okay.

33
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.650
Now you're going to use all this.

34
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.200
For the idea of the product ID is going to be the name of the product.

35
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.720
Okay.

36
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.470
So.

37
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.920
They're going to call this Gucci.

38
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.610
It's going to be goosey and oversize, I think.

39
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.140
Hopefully said that we.

40
00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.820
And.

41
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.020
For the title, which is the name of the products as Gucci.

42
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.940
Of our size.

43
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.040
Before we said that we look for the description.

44
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.320
That is the description of the products.

45
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.540
We can then say go see.

46
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.190
Is one of.

47
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.670
The best.

48
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.120
Seven Clothes and the universe.

49
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.420
Okay.

50
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.980
Great.

51
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.650
Now for the price is a double.

52
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.390
So it's going to be.

53
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.310
929..

54
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.680
They can just see.

55
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.500
Okay.

56
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.940
What's this?

57
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.050
Dollar against the next 9 to 9 nine.

58
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.070
Okay.

59
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.760
I did work away.

60
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.650
Okay.

61
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.320
I think we can answer the key into that.

62
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.110
That's okay.

63
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.880
So we're going to need.

64
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.240
I was going to say $99.99.

65
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.730
Right.

66
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.070
Okay.

67
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.440
George, are they in it?

68
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.400
Are the kids this trig when it's just because they're her dad or the it was your will is going to be

69
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.090
assets.

70
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.490
So it's slash wages slash forever.

71
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.040
One does p.

72
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.010
Angie.

73
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.450
Okay.

74
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.770
And for the product category name.

75
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.210
They can.

76
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.190
Get rid of this.

77
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.320
It's going to be close.

78
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.860
Okay.

79
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.110
And for the quantity we can see, we have to be stuck.

80
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.380
Okay.

81
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.860
I get you.

82
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.600
Come over here.

83
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.940
And how did you recover and then use control and save.

84
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.760
Right.

85
00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.170
Okay.

86
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.390
Now we can of another.

87
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.930
Can't face this.

88
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.000
Okay.

89
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.350
For the ID, which is also the product name.

90
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.570
We can call this t shirt.

91
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.160
And as well.

92
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.670
See the shows.

93
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.370
You can't say.

94
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.950
T shirts.

95
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.420
For the price.

96
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.970
In 1999.

97
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.080
I've seen the $99 just go.

98
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.200
We have to.

99
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.750
And as well it is the clothes category.

100
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.950
Okay.

101
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.430
Not to display this item, all you have to do is to get rid of this.

102
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.490
It's called products.

103
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.530
Products like the other passengers rockets.

104
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.470
Then you're going to see zero.

105
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.390
The zero is referring to the first product.

106
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.070
But that is the Indians.

107
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.800
Indians is referring to the starting point.

108
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.320
So this is the first.

109
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.950
This is one.

110
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.020
So it is a zero.

111
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.400
And this is one, right?

112
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.780
Okay.

113
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.970
So we're going to assess the first.

114
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.050
So it is zero.

115
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.730
Then you're going to say darts.

116
00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.270
It was your will if for any reason you can't is showing that IRL you can convert it.

117
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.960
String.

118
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.350
I took.

119
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.260
And for the name of the products.

120
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.570
But.

121
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.640
And they should be named.

122
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.960
Okay.

123
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.630
Get rid of this as well.

124
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.530
He's going to be on his car for God's.

125
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.470
Zero.

126
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.790
Then there's going to be darts.

127
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.720
It's okay because of us.

128
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.710
It's for that.

129
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.770
Okay.

130
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.010
The.

131
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.620
For the book does the tie to the product.

132
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.900
Okay for the price.

133
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.620
We need to get rid of this as well.

134
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.400
So there's going to be products.

135
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.980
On this score.

136
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.430
Sorry.

137
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.770
Sorry.

138
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.350
This is going to be on the score for.

139
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.730
That's.

140
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.530
Then darts.

141
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:02.420
I think for adults, then the zero, that is the first item that is going to be the prize.

142
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.000
Okay.

143
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.620
We can go out to string to string and adhere to the core.

144
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.070
Okay.

145
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.990
Great and now we can use contribute in there to save.

146
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.940
And go check.

147
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.490
Just feels out.

148
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.980
Okay.

149
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.630
You can see.

150
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.440
Is The Wire.

151
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.490
You can see all the assets in the.

152
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.840
Early access in the.

153
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.500
First.

154
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.410
It's their rights.

155
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.730
Okay.

156
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:47.290
So now in investiture, you're going to learn and also assess all individual a.

157
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.500
Okay.

158
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.150
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
