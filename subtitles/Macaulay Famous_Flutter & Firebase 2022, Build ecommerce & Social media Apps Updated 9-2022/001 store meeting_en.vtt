00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.970
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.610
Now, what you can also do is whenever a user creates a new method, we can then save that's created

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.550
method in the first or database.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.330
Okay.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
Now, to do this, we need to go back to our visit code.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.550
Now, we all agreed that the controllers order is really going to be creating all our logic or all the

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.260
functionalities of our have.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.159
So now what you can do over this controls folder, we can create a new FY and they're just going to

9
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.970
call this FY.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.230
So all the score controller.

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.110
Controller in this picture.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.610
Dot dots.

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.390
Okay.

14
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.050
And now we can use control.

15
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.700
And that's a big just wide.

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.030
Now, the first step we are going to take is you're going to need to create a class and you're going

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.930
to call this class.

18
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.670
Faster.

19
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.070
Controller.

20
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.820
Okay.

21
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.300
Great.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.240
Now the next step is you're going to create a function.

23
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.950
So now we can say void.

24
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.300
And the name of the function, we're just going to call this function.

25
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.330
Heart medicine to fire.

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.500
Stir.

27
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.120
Okay.

28
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.400
The in the parentheses over here are the over the parentheses.

29
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
We can then pass in the medicine name.

30
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.760
And since this is it, this is definitely going to be a type of string.

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.480
Okay.

32
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.410
You know where we can hide the college brackets?

33
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.970
Ten year pass and the sink since we're going to use the eggs.

34
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.410
Okay, great.

35
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.400
Now, the next ten you're going to do now is to have it try the cash block so you can then go to this,

36
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.290
not automatically have the cash.

37
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.210
Okay, great.

38
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.810
Now, the logic is we are going to create.

39
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.190
A sort coalition.

40
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.310
And that sort of coalition.

41
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.560
It's been a record midterm.

42
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.560
Or Mittens.

43
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.960
Right.

44
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.350
Okay.

45
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.330
And that's made sense.

46
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.220
Is only going to be available.

47
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.800
The user who created it.

48
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.610
That is, if you don't have an image created by you, you're not going to see that user, that Mittens

49
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.180
collection.

50
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.840
Okay.

51
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.040
So you're going to create that with this collection in this user's collections.

52
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.540
So those are called sorts collections.

53
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.500
Right.

54
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.300
So Coalition writes about everybody's users for its users.

55
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.520
Collections is more like a folder where all your files are being stored.

56
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:56.110
So you can see this user's collection as a folder via all your users or a document are being stored.

57
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.610
Well, now we just have one single user or one single document.

58
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.970
Right.

59
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.360
Okay.

60
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.850
Not to do this, you're not to have a self collection.

61
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.850
We need to first address this towards this user's collection.

62
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.170
Right.

63
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.560
Okay.

64
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.930
Now, over here, we are going to need to initialize the faster database.

65
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.960
So although you can create a final variable, which is Maguire, to specify the type of the variable,

66
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.580
it's a type of first or so five days.

67
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.810
Is faster.

68
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.290
Okay.

69
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.110
Then we can create a variable can on the score.

70
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.610
You can either go with this or this page is going to go with the score faster.

71
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.540
Dead is equal to five days faster.

72
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.100
Dan Dodds.

73
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.460
He says.

74
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.830
Right.

75
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.260
Okay.

76
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.850
Okay.

77
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.250
This.

78
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.720
Okay.

79
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.840
We can add.

80
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.770
Semicolon.

81
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.370
This is the try, right?

82
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.710
Okay.

83
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.130
David, this.

84
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.360
Okay.

85
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.590
Get rid of this.

86
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.210
Okay.

87
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.440
For our ways.

88
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.070
Faster.

89
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.720
Okay.

90
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.730
Now that we can't wait for this dance, we can dance for the score for our store.

91
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.430
That is disagreeable.

92
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.570
Then I don't need to have access to that.

93
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.590
Use this collection so you can see the collection.

94
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.010
The name of the collection is card users.

95
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.680
Like I said, this users.

96
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.080
This users collection is more like a folder where all our user is going to be stored.

97
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.470
Right.

98
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.900
All we are users is being stored for the now, which is our one user or documents.

99
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.310
Okay.

100
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.860
Now what I said next is.

101
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.260
The medicine is going to be available to all the user who created it.

102
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.680
Right.

103
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.980
So if you did not create an limitation, you're not going to see this subculture called admitted, but

104
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.890
can also do that.

105
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.420
So specify the meeting to a particular user or created it.

106
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.190
We need to have access to that user who created the wizard.

107
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.270
Hopefully you understand this thing is kind of confused about you're going to see this in action.

108
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.660
Okay.

109
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.190
Now, not to have the to have access to the user, Heidi.

110
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.180
We also need to create order, find a variable.

111
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.610
And it is going to specify the type is the type of firebase orts.

112
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.530
Right.

113
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.530
So you can see all this cohorts.

114
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.200
There is going to be equal to fives arts standards distance.

115
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.980
Okay.

116
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.480
Now we can add a semicolon over here because it does talk.

117
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.790
The talk is referring to the user.

118
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.220
Right.

119
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.590
So there we can see.

120
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.850
On the score.

121
00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:02.760
Arts standards committees are that as user or just created the written standards UID So it is we have

122
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.990
access to the user.

123
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.640
We just created the method for now the user would just created with it is what?

124
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.490
McAuliffe emails.

125
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.850
We are having access to this video wire.

126
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.850
So the meeting is going to be available to the specified user, not just all users.

127
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.020
Okay.

128
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.910
Now we can then create a self collection.

129
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.430
Dutch.

130
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.770
It's collection.

131
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.380
Then we can call this mid sense.

132
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.910
Okay.

133
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.410
Did we consider it hot?

134
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.560
Now you can either use the set, we'll get, you know, used or hot.

135
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.360
The reason for the dot odd is when you use the hot hot houses, it's automatically going to generate

136
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.550
a unique ID for you.

137
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.130
Whenever you want to use the users, you also create a collection.

138
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.520
You need to specify a hide just like this.

139
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.450
Just like this way.

140
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.940
You can see we have to specify the ID.

141
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.580
They said that the user ID was are you creating a new collection is more like a new collection.

142
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.500
It will do is a collection what is still a new collection of called meters.

143
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.120
But now you can see we are not specify the ID, right?

144
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.030
We could have said see the stock again.

145
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.650
They will need to specify the Heidi.

146
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.190
So in order to keep this type of code, I don't specify, although the ideal buyer is going to go ahead

147
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.360
to use the dot, dot, dot.

148
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.330
So by doing this five ways is automatically going to generate a unique ID for us.

149
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.070
So that was always I hate to use this sort of set of dot sets, right?

150
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.070
So you can although you can actually get rid.

151
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.010
You can actually get rid of this talk or there.

152
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.270
Get rid of.

153
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.660
This dark and used thought odd.

154
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.000
Though it's hard.

155
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.560
You still the same ten.

156
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.780
Dissented.

157
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:13.660
But this time around you don't have access creating the user you already yourself vote for VS is automatically

158
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.190
generated for you.

159
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:21.250
So it does basically different between heart of sets when you use hard files.

160
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.680
These is automatically generated Heidi for you.

161
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.130
When you use set, you need to generate the hide yourself.

162
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.570
So we are generating the idea based on the words these are you already great.

163
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.870
So that's the difference between the user the hard and sets.

164
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.020
Right.

165
00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.190
Okay, so that's going to be hard.

166
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.679
And can I just had this.

167
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.179
Okay.

168
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:48.780
They're going to specify the fields we need for the meters collection so we can say we need to retain

169
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.950
them first.

170
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.830
Is going to be written name.

171
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.270
Then we are going to have as also specify we need to created.

172
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.480
So we can just see created.

173
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.450
That is the date the meeting was created to get set date time.

174
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.470
Thoughts now.

175
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.120
Okay, great.

176
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.960
Okay.

177
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.750
This.

178
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.800
Okay, great.

179
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.060
Now, this basically is definitely this number will be an error.

180
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.390
But you can also you can just separate the.

181
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:25.950
Okay.

182
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.570
I'll just say we call on case control initiative.

183
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.450
Now we can then use control and B and we are going to go to the.

184
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.160
Gets it made controller.

185
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:45.990
So it gets the controller in all their needs to first not to have access to this function.

186
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:52.170
This person rights court hard we to crash.

187
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.290
We need to have access to this class so.

188
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.700
What is just the controller?

189
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.250
You can use control and be there.

190
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.450
We need to go to the top.

191
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.160
And.

192
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.030
You can do this before this or after.

193
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.540
This does not really matter.

194
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.780
So you can see the final is going to be.

195
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.550
Why are these so fast or controller in on this score?

196
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.360
You can just see.

197
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.060
So on the cell what we are basically doing.

198
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.090
We can go with this faster controller.

199
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.460
It is going to be equal to.

200
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.790
Faster.

201
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.340
Controller.

202
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.740
Okay, great.

203
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.510
Okay.

204
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.110
Now, over here, you can then say on the score.

205
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.350
Why are these controller dead?

206
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.360
We can have access to the hard medicine faster.

207
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.510
Now for the meeting.

208
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.790
Abe is going to be the room.

209
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.460
Name.

210
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.100
Okay, great.

211
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.060
This is basically it.

212
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.670
Hopefully it's a simple to you or is it to you?

213
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.860
But that's all we just need.

214
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:08.440
Now we can use control is so all to load in about to save those save flies if there is.

215
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.210
Okay.

216
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.500
Okay.

217
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:13.980
Okay.

218
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.430
Okay.

219
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.300
Okay, okay.

220
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:15.750
Okay.

221
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.290
Okay.

222
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.110
This has taken longer than expected.

223
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.430
Okay.

224
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.390
I think it's taking longer than expected.

225
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.750
Boy, you can just go ahead and try yours.

226
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.070
Right.

227
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.810
You can just go ahead and click on this.

228
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.550
The new medicine.

229
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.480
Okay.

230
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.420
I think mine are mine, but it's some issues.

231
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.780
Okay.

232
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.740
Okay.

233
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.620
It's almost a search for mine.

234
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.860
Well, if you don't use, you can just go ahead and check.

235
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.180
You can.

236
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.380
It's going to be visible.

237
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.520
Although I.

238
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.140
Right.

239
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.040
It's going to be visible over there for you.

240
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.640
Okay.

241
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.000
Connecting you to your mission.

242
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.610
There's no room for this.

243
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.400
And while he's a patient with me.

244
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.380
Okay.

245
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.150
Okay.

246
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:35.650
Okay.

247
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.850
Okay.

248
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:44.840
I'll just have to I'm not going to see this because I really have not saved that to save the fire before.

249
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.700
Okay.

250
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.330
Okay.

251
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.770
Let's do this again.

252
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.130
Court.

253
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.470
And this time we're just going to lose control next to save.

254
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.060
And now let's try this out ourselves together.

255
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.600
Okay.

256
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.230
New Britain.

257
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.410
Okay.

258
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.690
Great.

259
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.660
Okay.

260
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:29.770
Now let's go check.

261
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.770
If it was naturally created, it is going to go to this.

262
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.740
Then go back to this.

263
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.260
Okay.

264
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.060
You can see the.

265
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.620
You can see.

266
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.390
You can see.

267
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:52.480
The ID automatically generated as I do for us you can see created us and this is the meeting their right

268
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.470
to go to check it away.

269
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.920
You can see it is the same, right?

270
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.390
Okay.

271
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.280
Sounds good.

272
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.690
Now, if you have a user, this image, this collection is not going to be visible to that user.

273
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.290
Right.

274
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.890
So this basically it's generated an idea for us.

275
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.270
We did not do this.

276
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.020
Right.

277
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.500
Okay.

278
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.230
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
