Hi, Walker.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.120
Now, in the future, we're going to have all the products we have added to our carts over this screen.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.970
And over year, we're going to have the total price of all the products we have added.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.840
So our cuts.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.170
So in this year, we're going to create a function to calculate all the total product price.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.970
We are going to be hired into our cuts.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.420
Okay.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.950
Now, to do this, I need to go back to our visit code to fully.

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.230
Okay.

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.230
Now, over here, we are going to create a function to calculate the total price of all the products.

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.570
Okay.

12
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.780
Now we can specify it is a type of table and we are going to need to see get and we can call this.

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.140
Twitter.

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.220
Amounts.

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.980
Right.

16
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.430
Okay.

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.270
Now the first thing to do is to create a var variable.

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.850
And we can call this verbal torture.

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.180
Then we are going to set it to zero.

20
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.070
Since this is double according to hot dogs and not a zero again, then hot.

21
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.220
Your semicolon.

22
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.640
Okay.

23
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.080
Now, the next thing to do is we're to run a loop over each product.

24
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.010
We have that.

25
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.000
So I got to do that.

26
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.800
All you have to do is to call this variable card of this call cards items.

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.280
And now we are going to look over each product we have added to our cuts.

28
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.160
So we are going to need to set dots for each.

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.450
Okay.

30
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.470
Now we can use we can store or circle the gates of others very much like we all did in this variable.

31
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.970
Right.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.360
Okay.

33
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.170
So, yeah, because it's such a plus equal to value dot.

34
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.890
Price.

35
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.430
You can see we have access to all these attributes over here.

36
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.510
Right.

37
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.860
Okay.

38
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.240
Value the price.

39
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.500
Times.

40
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.240
Times.

41
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.450
Value does quantity.

42
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.560
Okay.

43
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.180
I'll just say we call on.

44
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.590
I'll just semicolon as well to in this thing to do is to retell this to to.

45
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.590
Okay.

46
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.140
So we can then say retard.

47
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.230
To try.

48
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.910
Okay.

49
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.830
I just have a caller.

50
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.360
Okay, great.

51
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.370
This is simply it.

52
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.710
So over here is the function to calculate the total price of all your products we have added to our

53
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.160
cuts.

54
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.620
Right.

55
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.970
Okay.

56
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.520
Now we can use this to save.

57
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.900
Okay.

58
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.010
Okay, guys.

59
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.600
See you in the next section.
