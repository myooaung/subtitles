00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.009
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.030
In this lecture, we're going to be able to retrieve the uploaded comments.

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.880
Okay, then not to do this, we need to go to the controls, that tree and then the correct controller.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.740
But before then, you can easily just pause this video and see if you can implement this yourself.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.970
Because we've already done this for the video controller when we were trying to retrieve our uploaded

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.020
videos.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.270
So you can see we have this over here.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.740
So now what we are about to do is going to be so similar to what we have over year.

10
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
So you can basically just pause the video and see if you can implement this yourself.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.420
Okay.

12
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
So now in order to do this, we need to go back to the comments controller.

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.530
Okay.

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.030
And now we can use controller and B to make this way.

15
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.660
Okay.

16
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.650
Now over here, we're going to need to call the function, all right?

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.760
So we can basically just call this function.

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.320
We have to create, we send the updates post ID.

19
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.220
So over here we can see gets comments.

20
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.209
Definitely we're going to have this era since we don't have any function.

21
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.600
HAASS Get comments.

22
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.340
So over here we can then create the gets comment.

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.850
Okay.

24
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.220
Now, as you know, we are going to be needing to have weights on in order to use the weight we need

25
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.410
to use the async.

26
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.070
Okay.

27
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.980
And now we can call this report card.

28
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.330
This variable based on this Qualcomm is.

29
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.570
On this car.

30
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.630
Comment and we are going to use this wish you send before wishes.

31
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.550
Thoughts bind.

32
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.300
Vine stream.

33
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.380
As for the stream, we need to have access to the comments collection.

34
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230
They need to have access to the comments collection.

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.820
We need to say fire.

36
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.230
For, sir.

37
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.550
Dot collection.

38
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.650
Everybody comments collection is inside the videos collection and therefore you can access the comments.

39
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.150
We have a group rights which is the UID, so you can sit or dock and post.

40
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.220
Heidi Right.

41
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.310
And now we can then see that collection again.

42
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.220
We didn't want to access the comments.

43
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.940
Okay.

44
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.060
And now we can.

45
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.700
Then say snap shots.

46
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.320
And Dot map.

47
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.770
You know, that's a look over these documents.

48
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.950
We have all these comments we have and now we can use this function and just had a semicolon.

49
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.410
Okay.

50
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.990
Not for the subs.

51
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.280
So for the event is going to take in something known as query snapshot because we are basically fetching

52
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.390
all the comments we have.

53
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.440
As for the variable, we can call this we query.

54
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.910
So we can just call this query and break this down.

55
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.330
Okay.

56
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.080
Now, the first thing to do, as you know, is to create an empty.

57
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.210
Variable.

58
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.930
Okay.

59
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.280
Least we can specify is going to be a type of the comment model.

60
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.750
And we can call this return value.

61
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.320
Okay.

62
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.960
And you can basically call this anything you which check.

63
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.360
And we can see it's going to be empty for now.

64
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.350
Okay.

65
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.720
Now we need to look over each comments and hard.

66
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.930
So this variable.

67
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.870
So to do that, you need to say for.

68
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.070
It can use.

69
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.160
Yes.

70
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.170
For var elements in.

71
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.290
In the query.

72
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.920
Standard docs would assess each document.

73
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.310
Okay.

74
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.820
What we just want to do is add to this list.

75
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.180
So.

76
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.480
So we add to this variable we talk about you start hard and we need to call this element.

77
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.330
The men's.

78
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.390
Dot.

79
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.390
So.

80
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.950
Return value.

81
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.950
And we need to see elements.

82
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.240
So the sentiments comments.

83
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.579
I meant.

84
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.440
I meant that from snap.

85
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.870
Okay.

86
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.540
And now we can then see elements.

87
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.920
Okay.

88
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.070
And then I think we're missing one.

89
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.580
Okay.

90
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.820
Had this in over a year.

91
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.760
We can then see.

92
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.990
Return.

93
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.080
Return, buddy.

94
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.250
Okay, great.

95
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.130
Now, this is basically it you can see similar to that.

96
00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.360
Now we can use control NSA and now the NSA to do is to go to the comments create.

97
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.540
Com ice cream.

98
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.770
Now over here, we had made a very huge mistake.

99
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.840
We had to wrap this this view that buteur and not in this tie.

100
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.810
Right.

101
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.140
You can see this this view, the view that as it look.

102
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.730
Right, you look over how many comments we have and then display that.

103
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.500
So what we should be wrapping is not this this die, but this this view.

104
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.900
Right.

105
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.220
Okay.

106
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.170
So we need to get rid of this.

107
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.220
So what we can basically just do is throughout this list view.

108
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.040
Okay.

109
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.350
With the stream view there first.

110
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.530
And then we named this computer.

111
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.030
So all the eggs and now we can get rid of what is inside here.

112
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.260
Get rid of this.

113
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.200
This.

114
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.480
And this.

115
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.060
Okay.

116
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.660
Okay.

117
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.480
In our case, control necessary for us.

118
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.580
Now we need to get rid of this obese.

119
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.840
Okay.

120
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.280
So what we can do is get rid of this.

121
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.260
Okay.

122
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.760
Now we're definitely going to have an error.

123
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.740
Scroll down and you need to get rid of this.

124
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.340
It is there.

125
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.180
And I think we.

126
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.230
Okay.

127
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.640
All right.

128
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.210
This is what we listen.

129
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.590
Okay.

130
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.160
I think.

131
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.060
We need to get rid of this or what?

132
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.230
Okay.

133
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.160
There's no he'll find this to see.

134
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.430
Listeners over here know.

135
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.750
Or this?

136
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.070
No, no.

137
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.890
Well, I'm doing it to get rid of this and hide.

138
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.850
Look, I can't really figure it out.

139
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.750
Okay.

140
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.440
First of all, we have the least time of year.

141
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.180
We need to get rid of this over a.

142
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.100
Now, this is of.

143
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.420
And.

144
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.280
We need to get rid of this.

145
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.640
Is this okay?

146
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.330
Great.

147
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.240
I got it.

148
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.840
Okay.

149
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.930
Okay.

150
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.460
So this is why we should be dropping the list view to be there.

151
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.330
Okay, you can see now we have the item counts.

152
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.680
Okay.

153
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.030
So now all we have to do is the further it's on.

154
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.350
It's in the high temperature.

155
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:47.980
We need to then create a finite variable called comments and it's going to be equal to the comments

156
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.630
controller.

157
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.650
And its comments list.

158
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.420
We call this comment list and we need to assess each comment by say in this.

159
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.150
Okay.

160
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.870
Great.

161
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.650
Now, I said of this, we can now get rid of this.

162
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.650
And say comments that what?

163
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.460
Pro five foot zero and.

164
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.790
It's in the comments.

165
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.060
That's what is a name.

166
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.920
So we come here.

167
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.890
Okay.

168
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.760
It's going to be comments, such comments.

169
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.420
That is the test.

170
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.419
And for the now we can see comments that's.

171
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.340
Date published.

172
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.350
You for the legs.

173
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.290
You can just use this and use this.

174
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.430
So.

175
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.940
And then see comments.

176
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.620
The likes.

177
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.000
Okay for the now, we will change it later.

178
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.380
Okay.

179
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.590
Now we cannot to start this at sea.

180
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.450
Okay.

181
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:08.920
Let's start starting.

182
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.280
Hear from an artist that.

183
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.120
And yeah, we can try this out.

184
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.110
This going the hottest that they have faced, sun and oak has done.

185
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.330
We can.

186
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.780
Okay.

187
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.570

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.010
We got no hair.

191
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.470
We can just try to see if we can upload.

192
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.670

Okay.

197
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.190

Okay.

201
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.960
All we can do is go back to the comic screen.

202
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.950
In screen.

203
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.650

204
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.470

206
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.930
And do.

207
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.170
And it can basically just get four days in the first.

208
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.690
Comments.

209
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.470

And let's see, we're going to sort out the rest later.

217
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:12.870
Okay.

218
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:16.630

227
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.360
And.

228
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:24.840
And.

229
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.470
Okay.

230
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.250

231
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:30.990
