00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.540
Hi.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.500
In this video, I want to show you a bit of a view of the e-commerce application, a group of users

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.430
throughout this course.

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.970
Okay.

6
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.330
Now, when a user first visit obligations, this is going to be the first page.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.110
These are going to see they can choose to slide this way.

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.550
Or you will miss or you will skip.

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.600
I just want to go back to the first page and certificate.

10
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.860
Okay, because you are saying something else.

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.480
And now the user can choose to sign in using a variety of ways.

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.020
They can choose to sign in with Google, sign in after August or sign off.

13
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.450
They can pick an image from a gallery.

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.590
Yeah.

15
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.310
And.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.990
Okay.

17
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.930
Okay.

18
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.310
We'll take a few minutes.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.670
Okay.

20
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.790
That doesn't go to my balance.

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.440
And just this.

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.760
And then we can feel this.

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.350
Okay.

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.420
Since our idea of an account is no, go to log.

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.490
You can even choose to.

26
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.210
We set our password in case we forgot it.

27
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.380
Okay.

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.950
Now I'm just going to log in.

29
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.050
I think have.

30
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.760
Yes.

31
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.630
And.

32
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.360
First.

33
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.260
What is this?

34
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.920
Okay, well, I'll give.

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.540
Okay.

36
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.460
So all user requests for the business class.

37
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.480
Okay.

38
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.110
It's a.

39
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.740
Can't see.

40
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.570
Okay.

41
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.670
I think I really respect.

42
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.960
Okay.

43
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.890
Okay.

44
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.500
Then we can click on logging.

45
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.820
Okay.

46
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.610
Great.

47
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.710
So you can see there's a long list of products.

48
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.370
Every little thing that's over there as well.

49
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.540
Rogers Fields.

50
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.020
We can't switch.

51
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.770
We can.

52
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.800
Consequently, we don't have any ice cream in our carts.

53
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.310
And this is my preferred.

54
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.800
You can see the profile image, the email address, the user name, their phone number and so on.

55
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060
We can also choose to upload tear ducts.

56
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.150
Okay.

57
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.010
And we have various categories.

58
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.520
The forms categories only form separately displayed.

59
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.420
We also have the clothes category.

60
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.380
All the clothes I got over to Fleet.

61
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.050
We also have our shoes categories.

62
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.590
You can have as many category as you want.

63
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.490
Okay.

64
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.300
But in our editorial series category, the this category, the clothes category are the shoes category.

65
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.440
Okay.

66
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.660
Now, we can click on any of this products and we can go back with this.

67
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.880

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.780
You can click on Add to Cart.

You can see apparently because of the cart there, we can then go to carts because you go via the candidate

71
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.940
equipment.

72
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.180
We can't as well decrementals.

73
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.040
Okay.

74
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.300
You can read the comments and the comments they can make.

75
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.260
You can see the two surprise as well as what a line and why it should be correct.

76
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.250
You can see it is now Nike hits.

77
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.290
Okay.

78
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.920
We can also remove this item.

79
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.150
Our car.

80
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.230
Okay.

81
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.019

Look at this.

85
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.180
It's just $5,000.

86
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.060
Okay.

87
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.870
We can add this from.

88
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.020
Okay.

89
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.960
Now you can see this gradient card.

90
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.010
Now, let's go see our cards.

91
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.250
Okay.

92
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.270
You're going to see the value, right?

93
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.420
And the total prize is $5,449.

94
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.780
Right.

95
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.140
Okay.

96
00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.030
Now currently please note there is no payment method, but if you want to add one we can.

97
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.200
Then I can then make a video on how to integrate this drive immediately or pay for what?

98
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.190
Currently quoting now.

99
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.710
We don't have to commit myself for this.

100
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.980
I've been ordered to order for this product.

101
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.280
All we just have to do is IPsec or check out.

102
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.490
You can see it's got this of light.

103
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.030
So I came can see.

104
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.020
Okay.

105
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.740
Great.

106
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.400
Okay.

107
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.890
Now we're going to go back to the letter and you can.

108
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.300
Then go to my hotel.

109
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.930
Okay.

110
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.480
We can see what we just ordered, right?

111
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.240
But you can see what you just saw, that we can do all this from other cities.

112
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.400
But to get to this set, it is a little this.

113
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.460
Where will this and will this?

114
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.500
Okay, great.

115
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.310
Now, like I said, currently we don't have anything really tight for this.

116
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.480
But if you want to have one, we can then make your video and I can then make a video on that for you

117
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.550
and also integrates just try to let me talk to all the people before.

118
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.590
But for now we don't have currently we are using the firebase.

119
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.780
What if you also want to know not to use it cause some ugly panic attack?

120
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.360
There's only a video on that for you.

121
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.550
But clearly, this is.

122
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.320
Basically is they can go to different category to hard items.

123
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.140
Okay.

124
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.080
You can see currently we are working hard, right.

125
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.250
Because we recently had that that products can get to a little bit from my heart.

126
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.690
Okay.

127
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.740
Go to heart and did it this.

128
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.150
And I kept that from the category because you're going to see is of the available now the prices on

129
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.690
the dollar.

130
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.210
Parts.

131
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.270
Okay.

132
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.770
Great.

133
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.260
Now we have it all right here.

134
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.550
Right.

135
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.850
I can choose to just try and just get rid of this.

136
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.360
Okay.

137
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.400
So they.

138
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.160
Okay.

139
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.690
Okay.

140
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.840
And.

141
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.370
Hi.

142
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.780
Okay, I can see.

143
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:39.890
I want to watch Siri because it goes towards your little control people and checkouts.

144
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.780
Can you give it away?

145
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.650
Okay.

146
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.400
Your prize is product ID.

147
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.570
The quantities to the name of the product is technical power.

148
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:58.430
And the user, Heidi, writes, and as well we can upload products.

149
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.090
Okay.

150
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.670
I can't say the price is.

151
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.310
Sorry.

152
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.030
No, the product is to

153
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.200
she.

154
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:20.240
And the prize is maybe 70, not 99, $70.

155
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.740
And we can applaud Colonel Galloway.

156
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.190
Became outlaws like this for the product.

157
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:38.970
And like I said, every category is going to be the clothes category and brand because they're going

158
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.720
to go with this.

159
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.210
Therefore, this is crucial using the time to.

160
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.390
Over here to show you.

161
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.350
You can upload products that they can click on.

162
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.390
The quantity.

163
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.430
We have serious stock.

164
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.960
They can quickly offload.

165
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.380
Okay.

166
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.320
We'll look for that here.

167
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.840
Okay.

168
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.450
Good tech products.

169
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.030
Okay.

170
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.620
Now let's go back to the home screen.

171
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.960
See?

172
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.340
You can see it as I write, the key is the title with the description.

173
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.940
We'll just add that.

174
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.360
Okay.

175
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.060
Okay.
