00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.600
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.170
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.430
Now, after the user clicks on, log in and if no errors, what they're going to do is they're going

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.230
to take the user to the next page.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.650
Okay.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.570
Now, this is what I'm going to do in this lecture, but before we do together, you're going to try

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.440
to do it yourself.

8
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.220
Okay.

9
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.640
Now, what you're going to do is over this Chris Potter.

10
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.160
They're going to create a new play.

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.070
Right.

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.970
They're going to create a new fight and they're going to call this fight bottom now.

13
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.729
But there is a war.

14
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.310
This is big fights in future they're going to have.

15
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
So that is when these are critics on this.

16
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.170
These are going to be some advocates to different pages.

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.560
Okay.

18
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.710
So what you're going to do now is over this, Chris, for.

19
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
They're going to create a new far able to codify bottom.

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.430
Now you can choose who is a stateless Wichita State, who gets you can easily change that data.

21
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.910
Okay.

22
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.840
Then after creating that, what you're going to do next is after clicking on the log in and if there

23
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.810
is no arrow, you're going to take the user.

24
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.780
So the bottom of the page.

25
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.160
Okay, so that's what you're going to do.

26
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.990
So try to pause the video or try to implement that yourself because I'm going to give you some leads

27
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.670
to useful.

28
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.730
You can see over here we have the youth and house, right?

29
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.230
The over the youth, I guess.

30
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.830
Okay.

31
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.320
So try to put in red dots yourself.

32
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.490
Create a new PHI column called Bottom NAV Bar.

33
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.960
Make sure you look all is part of the educational bar because we have a widget known as bottom navigation

34
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.230
bar.

35
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.290
So definitely there were no conflicts we showed.

36
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.270
Okay, so try to do that.

37
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.180
So pause the video and do that.

38
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.020
Okay.

39
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.650
Okay, guys, see you in picture.
