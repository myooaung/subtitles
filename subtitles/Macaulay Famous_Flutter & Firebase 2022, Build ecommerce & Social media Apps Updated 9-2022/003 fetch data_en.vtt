00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.410
Or come in this lecture, you go learn a lot of fancy data.

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.410
We going to be fetching the current logged in user data.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.690
And also you go, Linda, that's a display that data are in the profile screen.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.110
Okay.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.560
Now in order to do this on the need to go back to our VSC code and then the profile screen.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.980
Okay?

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.460
And now we can use control and B to make this wide.

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.690
First of all, we're going to need to combat this lest we get too excited for Jets because we're going

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.360
to be using the interstates and unassisted, which are not available in the state, less widgets.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.870
So, all right, you're going to add light and then use control and dots and then culverts to state

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.470
forward jets.

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.040
Okay.

14
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.210
Now are going to fetch the user name first.

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.790
Okay.

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.300
To do this over here, we can create a variable.

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.620
It's going to be a test is going to be a type of string.

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.870
And you can call this what is called name.

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.730
You can make invisible private.

20
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.960
So another to be able to mistakenly call this variable in another fly.

21
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.340
Okay, now we can start a semicolon.

22
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.830
Since we are not holding any value to hit at the moment, we are going to need to say it can't be.

23
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.060
No, that is its can't be empty.

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.440
Okay.

25
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.150
Can you just give some bits of space?

26
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.000
And over here, we're going to create a function.

27
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.790
And you want to call this function.

28
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.860
Get user data.

29
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.550
This is going to take some time.

30
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.500
So we're going to need to wait for it.

31
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.280
I know.

32
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.730
That's easy.

33
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.220
Wait.

34
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.610
You need to pass in the HiSeq or Via.

35
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.210
Okay.

36
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.750
Now, the next step Lebanon needs to do is we're going to need to go into this use as collection.

37
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.330
You can see this use as collection, as a folder.

38
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.050
We hold our documents or users are being stored.

39
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.970
Right.

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.390
Okay.

41
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.180
Now that we're going to need to see how it is.

42
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.760
First of all, we can study results in a variable quite.

43
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.639
User.

44
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.870
User data.

45
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.160
Then two weeks.

46
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.720
There's going to be five ways I think we as well have.

47
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.170
In the course directory.

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.040
We have this.

49
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.320
Firebase Store.

50
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.390
Okay, so we can just use that rainbow.

51
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.110
How each firebase store.

52
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.420
Dirt collection.

53
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.980
We're going to assess the user's collection.

54
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.480
Right.

55
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.880
Okay.

56
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.260
Now we are inside this user's directory.

57
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.030
Now you can see each user is connected by and Heidi.

58
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.460
Right.

59
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.230
So over here you're going to need to say dot dock then recognizes that user the current load these are

60
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.080
by saying firebase OTS which we also do have any hearts dots.

61
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.310
Chorus user dots you, Heidi.

62
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.210
Okay.

63
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.920
Now we have access to the car, a logged in user.

64
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.280
Now we just have to say is dots get okay.

65
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.600
Now you can see it wants us to specify the time.

66
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.820
It is going to be a type of document snapshots.

67
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.420
It is document snapshots because we are just getting a single user.

68
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.320
For example, if we want to fetch all our products, this is going to be known as is going to be query

69
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.100
snapshots.

70
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.730
Okay.

71
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.950
So since we are getting just a user is going to be a type of document snapshots.

72
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.120
Okay.

73
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.870
Great.

74
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.210
Now we can dance states or value sets.

75
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.000
States.

76
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.100
And then we can then or this variable.

77
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.140
That says I want to add value now to this variable you can then see is equal to the user.

78
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.350
Detail does.

79
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.710
Get.

80
00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.200
He's asking for the field.

81
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.029
The field is going to be.

82
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.810
We can use our name field.

83
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.310
Okay.

84
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.480
User name.

85
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.150
Okay.

86
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.110
Great.

87
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.000
Now this is basically it.

88
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.840
Now, what's really done this is over year.

89
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.360
They're going to use in this state, which isn't in this state because we want this function to get

90
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.100
triggered immediately.

91
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.660
We visit this property page.

92
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.990
Okay.

93
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.020
So we're going to call that function called gets user data.

94
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.500
Okay.

95
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.260
Great.

96
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.000
And now what we can then do is over this crossword, we can just have an eye by harbor.

97
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.890
Hubba.

98
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.970
And you know, it has the title and it says that we can just print out that.

99
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.540
Print out these and in the harbor by saying on this car name.

100
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.540
Okay.

101
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.640
Greats, not hearts.

102
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.870
We start this.

103
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.830
Well, she starts.

104
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.680
It's gonna take some time, okay?

105
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.810
You're going to need to wait for it to process.

106
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.540
And.

107
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.860
Wait for it.

108
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.370
Okay.

109
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.900
Now click on this.

110
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.640
Okay.

111
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.280
For now it is.

112
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.900
Okay, great.

113
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.530
So you can see.

114
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.410
It was known at first and these are was displayed right away.

115
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.920
You can see that was why we needed to use this set state internets automatically refresh or reveal state

116
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.560
that we should get rid of this and this.

117
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.040
You're going to get some heroes because at that time, it was going to be.

118
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.460
No.

119
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.260
Right.

120
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.730
Okay.

121
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.930
So we're just gonna do this.

122
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.370
Okay.

123
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.800
Okay.

124
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.250
Okay.

125
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.670
Okay.

126
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.450
Okay, okay.

127
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.840
Okay.

128
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.200
Okay.

129
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.860
Click on this.

130
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.160
Okay.

131
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.160
You can see it is law.

132
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.380
Most of the time you are just going to get an error.

133
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.200
So what we can do is we can all do this.

134
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.590
Okay.

135
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:35.920
Now, so in order to get the email address, you can as well just create this strange Web card and this

136
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.760
code name for this car email.

137
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.760
So there is in this email because we don't want you mistakenly being able to refer to this.

138
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.140
Okay.

139
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.270
So what we can do is we can see this car.

140
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.200
Email.

141
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.020
Now we don't really need the user this we don't really need this get because the for it's the sign in

142
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.090
mentor it is user the assignment of this email and password.

143
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.110
This is just an extra field so what are urging us to do that so you can just see user data.

144
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.790
Dots.

145
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.770
I think there's going to be dogs.

146
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.250
User data.

147
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.030
Okay.

148
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.200
We can't just say he's a dictator.

149
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.510
That gets okay as well.

150
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.050
Email.

151
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.050
Okay.

152
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.510
As well.

153
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.860
You can display it and.

154
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.490
You can also have four.

155
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.220
The full name image Jarrell use email for name, image, area and order.

156
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.960
So this basically it's allowed to fetch data.

157
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:55.720
So first of all, what we did is we needed to convert this to state that to sit for widgets.

158
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.090
Right.

159
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.660
And the reason for this is because we are going to be using the.

160
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.480
In his state.

161
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.810
Right.

162
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.600
And the state I which I said it is not available in the stimulus budget.

163
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:14.320
So we needed to use this pitiful budget in order to have access to the enlisted property and this tested

164
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.920
property.

165
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:25.180
So what we first did is we created a verbal code name, which we said, which we said it can't be.

166
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.480
No.

167
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.020
The reason for this is because we are currently not assigning any value to this.

168
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.250
We are currently not doing it like this.

169
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:33.580
Right.

170
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.370
So we are saying it can't be null for now.

171
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.130
Okay then over here.

172
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.140
We created a function called gets user data is going to take some time.

173
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.680
It's going to be it is a future.

174
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.550
It's going to take some time.

175
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.920
So we are using the async and the value.

176
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.000
We are waiting for it.

177
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:59.970
And over here we created a variable called user data to store the value and the value we needed to specify

178
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.960
the type that it is a type of document snapshot.

179
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.710
Like I said, when you want to fetch a just you just the document is going to be known as document snapshots.

180
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:17.370
When the case of fetching all our products from the database is going to be the query snapshot that

181
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.160
says we also need to look over each product.

182
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:20.570
Right.

183
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:20.940
Okay.

184
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.180
And over here we are saying collections.

185
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.840
Collections, that is the user collection wants have access to where all our users are stored.

186
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.200
And remember every user has the uid.

187
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.240
That's the link between.

188
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.230
The use this collection and this.

189
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.450
So in order to assess each user, we need to first assess the UID.

190
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.610
You can see it is more like a blockage, right?

191
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.020
So it is this step, this step and this step.

192
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.760
Right.

193
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.160
So that was that is what we are basically doing.

194
00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:01.220
NOBLE Yeah, we are using the states and are yeah, we called that variable we created and now we are

195
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.740
signing a value to it.

196
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.190
Okay.

197
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.640
So this basically an out of fish user data.

198
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:07.970
Okay.

199
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.520
Like I said, you're going to need to watch this video up to five times in order for you to master the

200
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.590
code and be able to do it yourself.

201
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.010
Okay.

202
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.670
Okay.

203
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.480
If we don't see on the sound you can do LA will do well to let me know.

204
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:22.900
Okay.

205
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.920
Then I will try my best to explain more the part for you.

206
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:27.310
Okay.

207
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.160
Okay, guys, see it in this picture.
