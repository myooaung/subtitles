00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.180
In this lecture, we're going to sort out this area and this area.

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.570
Okay?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.880
You can see where we are simply using the fields we have in the database.

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.120
That is the I.D. and title to the solution.

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.230
So as well, we're going to do the same thing for the price board.

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.540
So we're going to be using different methods to do this.

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.210
And that's what we're going to be doing this for the quantity.

10
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.600
Okay.

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.920
Now I'm going to show you this.

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
You can see in the models directory where we have all this fields.

13
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.060
Okay.

14
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.900
And we'll take you to the models directory.

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.140
Okay.

16
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.710
You can see.

17
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.230
Okay.

18
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.770
So you can see over here, we have specified that the quantity is going to be a type of imp and the

19
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.120
price is going to be a detail type of what, double?

20
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.530
Okay.

21
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.350
So now what you're going to need to do to solve that here is, okay, we're going to go back to the

22
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.470
third dot, right?

23
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.820
Okay.

24
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.360
Then over here, we're going to set double.

25
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.590
Double Dutch.

26
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.890
I think price.

27
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.340
P e like this.

28
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.620
Okay, great.

29
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.250
You can see he's asking for the sauce.

30
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.400
So now we can then see elements.

31
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.080
The arts gets.

32
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.540
Okay, and now we can call the price okay for the same thing.

33
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.490
But this is going to be the opposite because over there, over in the models directory and in the products,

34
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.920
you can see we said the quantities are going to be a type of and that is in number.

35
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.070
We touch a decimal point or symbol.

36
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.480
Okay.

37
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.340
Okay.

38
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.020
So this is going to be the opposite, that this is going to be in the words that pass.

39
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.820
Right.

40
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.190
And there's going to be elements Dodds gets.

41
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.840
Okay.

42
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.830
The field is what's called.

43
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.720
To make sure you don't make his especially mistake as you're going to get it.

44
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.580
But state her.

45
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.020
Okay.

46
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.870
I think over this we need one addition.

47
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.350
Okay.

48
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.400
Now we can hardly start this, and hopefully we have no heroes.

49
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.430
Okay.

50
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.800
And now you can see we are not using the prize from the database.

51
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.230
You can hide as many forget as you want.

52
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080
And they're going to have different price.

53
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.830
Okay.

54
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.700
Hopefully we got the error and I think it's going to be French or probably.

55
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.250
Okay, you can see we got no hair.

56
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.850
Okay.

57
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.800
Now currently, I think the in the database, we said that the prize is going to be 40.

58
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.260
Right.

59
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.450
So that's basically it.

60
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.700
So you can as well specify some other prize and you can check out the winner to see if probably we got

61
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.080
an error.

62
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.750
Okay.

63
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.270
You can see we got the error.

64
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.990
Right.

65
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.660
Sounds good.

66
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.540
You can as well upload more products of that.

67
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.220
Okay.

68
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.540
So this basically it's now, you know, our two fats products of the product categories and many others.

69
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.930
Okay.

70
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.990
Now, if your job is not working fully well, you can't do what?

71
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.500
Let me know.

72
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.130
Probably you have some order errors.

73
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.560
I don't know.

74
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.150
But you can at least tell me.

75
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.220
So we're going to solve that together.

76
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.130
Okay.

77
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.270
But for now, I think that this whole.

78
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.750
The does all you basically basically need to know about how it's viewed and.

79
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.910
E-commerce website.

80
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.280
If you think there is for that thing, you would like me to cover it, you can let me know.

81
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.330
So I'm going to make a video of that.

82
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.770
Okay?

83
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.580
Okay, guys, see you later.
