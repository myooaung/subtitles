00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.690
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.060
Now, this lecture, we're going to create the fields for the email and password.

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.570
Okay?

5
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.590
Now I'm going to do it one more time that I will copy and paste it.

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.880
But what you can simply do, you can just copy and paste it yourself.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.310
That is, if you have mastered this process.

8
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.030
Okay, so now what we can do is over.

9
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.300
You can add a chain of command and you can have another first of all, it is with you is size books,

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.990
right?

11
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.790
You know what this does?

12
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.070
They were going to use the height as well.

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.470
20.

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.970
Okay.

15
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.990
Good.

16
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.930
Okay.

17
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.070
Now you're going to have to test food, right?

18
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.760
So we're going to set decoration is going to be imputes decoration.

19
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.930
Okay.

20
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.420
We insist we should have said it's more like a place order in Istanbul.

21
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.480
So it's going to enter your email.

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.400
The key.

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.130
Now we're going to give you some border rights at all sides as we outline the imputes.

24
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.940
But by making for the.

25
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.880
Okay, now what you can do.

26
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.260
You can look at save and that's it.

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.410
Just see it again.

28
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.740
Look, now you can see we how you can.

29
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.550
But so what?

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.060
You can't do it.

31
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.680
You can't just get rid of it.

32
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.810
So now to get rid of the product, all sides we tend to if.

33
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.020
But I've known only people that you can save for the side report side.

34
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.360
That's not okay.

35
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.900
Good.

36
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.190
So for that idealistic, artsy.

37
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.400
During the.

38
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.640
Okay.

39
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.120
Now you can see.

40
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.900
We can barely see.

41
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.289
So what we can do is we can guess so.

42
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.020
So we turn that into a situation, right?

43
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.020
We can see, feel, feel

44
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.270
is true.

45
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.870
Okay, so that's going to give us some greenish color.

46
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.630
Can I go check it out?

47
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.730
So really, we don't need to focus for I guess this is our idea.

48
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.850
They can see we don't have that gray.

49
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.390
So it does green border because you have added this way to it.

50
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.500
Okay.

51
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:53.020
Well, look, I guess that's a dodge in case we don't have this feel so as well, because the forecast

52
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.880
for the at least I know you should know what this does.

53
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.620
So you can see outline if you go to they're going to say the voter side, default is going to be green

54
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.540
set on the other side.

55
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.680
They'll want to change the color to the colors, the black.

56
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.520
Okay.

57
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.980
Let's take a listen to.

58
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.320
Okay, Nicola, I just.

59
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.080
Okay, then go check it out.

60
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.150
Okay, great.

61
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.800
Okay.

62
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.320
Now we can close this.

63
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.660
Since they are the same, you can just as well use a reusable widget, but I think sometimes using the

64
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.560
invisible widget can make things even more complex than you think.

65
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.890
Okay, so this year is going to be enter your password.

66
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.260
I tried to save the kid, I guess is very close.

67
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.230
What you can't do is keep its eyes closed as well.

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:07.200
So you can see his size looks like it's going to be height rate of 20 as well.

69
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.440
Okay, great.

70
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.650
Great.

71
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.940
The ticket does look good.

72
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.070
Now, what you can do is you can have a button, right?

73
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.250
That is the registered button.

74
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.210
Isn't that critical?

75
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.300
Okay.

76
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.430
First of all, I'm going to give you two sides as well as a box, not a separate button of the last

77
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.950
word.

78
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.280
So I'm going to say eight or 20.

79
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.910
In addition, a comma there, we're going to have a container.

80
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.720
Okay.

81
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.880
Now, first of all, you're going to give the protein a weight.

82
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.770
You're going to get this to the screen with not to get the weight of the screen.

83
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.180
We can just say media.

84
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.630
We the media for that, of course, is the size and weight.

85
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.230
So with this, we've gotten the width of the screen that we just want the -48, that the height of the

86
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.820
button is going to be 50.

87
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.880
Once again, have it's a decoration.

88
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.040
It's going to be box decoration.

89
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.640
Okay, then we can have a color.

90
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.130
You're going to be the same color, right?

91
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.210
Okay.

92
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.110
We'll check it out.

93
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.950
Okay.

94
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.510
Good.

95
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.410
Now we can have.

96
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.560
They charge that it's outside the box decoration.

97
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.320
They're just going to say to the left, we are going to hide.

98
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.050
So there's going to be Santa.

99
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.310
Then the child is going to be kissed.

100
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.320
Mrs..

101
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.950
Register.

102
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.790
Okay.

103
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.000
I'm going to be honest if one reads fonts.

104
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.150
So, Lewis says.

105
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.730
So sorry.

106
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.090
The reforms.

107
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.490
Which comes with the food.

108
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.090
Okay.

109
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.480
Check it out.

110
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.650
Okay.

111
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.200
Because that would give a font full size to look this big of 24.

112
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.620
I really do know what we give it for to register it.

113
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.640
Think of it.

114
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.220
Okay, great.

115
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.700
Okay.

116
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.660
Now, on your whole, what you're going to try to do is to implement the already have an account and

117
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.750
log in.

118
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.880
So what you're going to do is to use a row right now to just get horizontally.

119
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.520
You're going to be needing what's a little widget.

120
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.530
So try to implement that yourself.

121
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.580
You're going to have to test that is what you already have an account that you're going to see.

122
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.780
Log in to that.

123
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.350
Log in.

124
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.650
You're going to create a function to take the user to the log in, log in screen.

125
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.660
So try to implement that yourself.

126
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.110
Okay.

127
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.050
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
