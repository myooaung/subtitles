00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.250
In this lecture, we are going to create a loading spinner to tell the user that, hey, your account

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.440
is being created and you have to wait till it finishes, okay?

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.590
To do this, the first step is to create a variable and you can already have this variable.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.670
The reason for this is because we copied most of the code.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.110
Okay, so over here we have a variable which is called it's loading and we are setting it to a value

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.159
of force.

9
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:39.150
And over here we said it is a type of bull with either a true and a false value.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.660
If you don't have this variable, you can just create it now.

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.990
The next step is to scroll down to where we have the sign of function.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.530
And over here we have to set state, set state.

13
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.270
And the reason we are setting the state is because we basically want to update the UI.

14
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.830
You can see over here we currently have this test which says sign up.

15
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.200
And if all these fields are filled in, then we want to update this sign of test to another widget.

16
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.020
That is the Circular Progress Indicator.

17
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.540
So what this says states will do is it automatically refresh the UI.

18
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.290
The set state is very similar to that of using control and save, but we would always want to use the

19
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.190
control and as a save in order to get the recent changes.

20
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.460
So that is what the set states will basically do.

21
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.160
It will automatically restart our hub behind the same.

22
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.640
So if all the fields are filled in, then we want to set state right and we want to change the this

23
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.230
variable called it's loading.

24
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.240
Is Lowden.

25
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.980
And we want to change it to.

26
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.420
True.

27
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.920
So he's going to start loading.

28
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.020
Is Lowden.

29
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.500
Okay.

30
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.900
Just try and save and the value you can see we are how we tend for the process.

31
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.210
That is, it's going to take some time to create the user in the Firebase orders.

32
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.670
And because of that we have to tell Flutter we are ready to wait for the process.

33
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.080
That is, we want this to finish first before all the stuff like this will have to start.

34
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.560
Else if you if you remove this away and remove this away, most of the time this boat is going to get

35
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.450
called off same time.

36
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.400
So over your ways and there are ways to tell Flutter, we want this code to run first before running

37
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.270
the order.

38
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.380
Okay.

39
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.210
So now over your business saving the data in the cloud faster.

40
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.270
So what we can do after successfully creating the accounts and the Firebase cards in the Firebase tab

41
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.130
and over here we are going to store the seller's details to the cloud faster.

42
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.310
And after that, we can then set state again.

43
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.060
So update the UI again, set state.

44
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.210
And now we want to set state is loading.

45
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.200
It is going to be equal to force.

46
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.720
Okay.

47
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.410
Great.

48
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.930
And this is basically it's both.

49
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.210
What we can also do is we can make this a bit more cleaner or a bit more readable, just like the simple

50
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.960
English.

51
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.300
To do this, we can get rid of this.

52
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.380
And at the end of our year it has a property known as DOT when completes.

53
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.060
You can see that when completes and it is a function.

54
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.420
So what we are basically saying after this has been successfully stored in the cloud store and after

55
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.070
it has been must have been completed, then only we want to set state.

56
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.760
So I think it is more visible like this and it's slowed in.

57
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.580
Is going to be equal to what's forced to stop the loading spinner.

58
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.700
Force.

59
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.480
Okay.

60
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:26.810
And now we have to implement that finally and we have to head back to sign up to create the Circular

61
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.250
Progress Indicator.

62
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.190
And over here you can see we already have it.

63
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.260
The reason for this is because we copied most of the code.

64
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.550
But in case you don't have it, to make your life much more easier for you can can do this again.

65
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.430
Okay.

66
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.720
Now, you can see we have just this test.

67
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.650
We just.

68
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.940
And it has the value of sign up.

69
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.190
So what we can do is we can then call that variable is slowed in.

70
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.410
It's loaded and if it's equal to true.

71
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.520
Right.

72
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.890
And you can see currently we are setting it to true.

73
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.690
That is immediately the user clicks on the signup and if the fields are filled in is equal to true.

74
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.140
And currently once we click on it, it's going to be equal to true.

75
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.240
Then we want to return a widget known as secular.

76
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.910
Hopefully I get another prediction.

77
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.160
Circular Progress Indicator.

78
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.610
And it is a widget and it has a background color property and even the color property.

79
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.790
But we're just going to give a color and we can say colors that scene or sign.

80
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.330
I think it's called sign because the sign.

81
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.190
Okay.

82
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.000
Get rid.

83
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.930
Else.

84
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.180
If it is equal to true wealth, if it is not equal to two, then we want to show that this is contrary

85
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.510
and as to save now.

86
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.870
And what we can do is to try this out.

87
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.520
And I am going to pick an image from my gallery.

88
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:13.620
And when they pick this beautiful lady over there and is asking for the full name, remember, the full

89
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.130
name is is seen as the store name.

90
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.150
Probably you could just rename this to say store name and instead of full name for the full name, I'm

91
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.640
just going to use a test.

92
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.840
User Test user Ord says store.

93
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.350
And for the email address is going to be test.

94
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.680
Tests or.

95
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:46.870
HUD's Gmail its card and for the password is going to be a Y and a C.

96
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.120
I can just check to make sure it is correct and click on the sign up.

97
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.240
Okay.

98
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.600
You can see currently.

99
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.550
Oh, we said the color is going to be okay.

100
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.430
What we can just do, I can just call this process by auto starting.

101
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:12.570
You can see we can barely see this because the background is sign and we are saying the circular progress

102
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.220
indicator is also going to be signed.

103
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.110
So it's going to be difficult to see.

104
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.690
So what we can do, we can make this.

105
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.450
White.

106
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.800
Okay.

107
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.830
Use control and save now.

108
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.890
Okay.

109
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.630
And.

110
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.660
We have to try this again.

111
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.320
And now back to the site of creating accounts.

112
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.690
And we're just going to pick this one.

113
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.550
Most of the time you would want to have the store image.

114
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.240
Okay for the store name.

115
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:56.800
This is going to be test two in case that goes created test to test to store.

116
00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.370
And test.

117
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.200
To stir.

118
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.200
Emile.

119
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.190
It's calm.

120
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.600
And the password is B.J. Macy.

121
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.860
We're just going to be sure it is correct.

122
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.380
And click on sign up.

123
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.190
You can see now the.

124
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.340
The loading spinner, and we just have to wait for this a bit.

125
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.310
Okay.

126
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.020
Seems good working as expected.

127
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.840
So after it has been successfully created.

128
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.870
You can see it's going to stop the load and Spain is going to set into force because that is what we're

129
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.570
basically saying, that when complete, when this is fully complete and over here you can see we are

130
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.180
also set in our form.

131
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.750
And over here you can see we are updating the image to know.

132
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.820
Okay.

133
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.700
Seems good.

134
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.930
Okay, guys.

135
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.220
See you in the next lecture.
