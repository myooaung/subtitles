00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.920
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.740
In this lecture, we're going to have Civitas Fields, and this theatre's fields are going to be displayed

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.640
vertically.

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.370
That is from top to bottom.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.970
Okay, so now what we're going to need to do is outside this row within the column widget.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.800
First of all, we can just have the comma.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.990
By the way, it's ends like this contract.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.530
Let's save outside this row.

10
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.680
First of all as well, we're going to need the trailing cover.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.450
Then we can then have the test filled or we can just go with the test home field.

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.360
It's basically the same thing.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.160
Okay, that's from field.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.460
And the test from field has a property known as decoration.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.160
And this is going to be imputed.

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.220
The Declaration.

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.520
The MP declaration has the property known as lab test for the lab test.

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.310
We're going to say full name.

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.129
How did you recover it then?

20
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.480
Is that safe?

21
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.270
You can see the value in the OC for the OC.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.930
Now when we click on this, we want to have something displayed inside.

23
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.990
So to do that, the MP decoration has a property load as each test.

24
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.120
It's test and we can say enter your.

25
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.490
You're.

26
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.740
Full name.

27
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.270
Okay.

28
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.740
Now it's come true.

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.790
And that's the save.

30
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.900
And.

31
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.810
Now click on this.

32
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.990
You're going to see the value.

33
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.290
Okay, great.

34
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.280
Now, what we also want to do is we want to have.

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.820
This slide all over the sides like not to do that this input the has a property known as border and

36
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.540
we can then say outline imputes border.

37
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.380
Now this content is safe to see what it does.

38
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.139
Fibula.

39
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.919
See this route?

40
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.970
Okay, great.

41
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.890
Now, I think this is way too straight.

42
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.300
So what we can do is we can have some rounded shape.

43
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.320
But before then, what we can simply do is over a year, we can.

44
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.180
Have a sized box.

45
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.610
Sized box and.

46
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.950
Height of.

47
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.810
Probably said for now and see.

48
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.740
Okay.

49
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.560
Okay.

50
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.520
All we can just say 15.

51
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.080
15 NC.

52
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.030
Okay.

53
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.240
Now you can see this is way too straight.

54
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.820
Now, the outline pit border has a property known as border radius.

55
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.560
For the border radius, we can say border radius, whether it is dot circular and we can say 15 for

56
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.270
all sides or we can just go with 25 for all sides.

57
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.540
That is our round is going to be and over here we can should look over how to turn the cover in the

58
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.310
to have a very good format.

59
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.070
Look, you can see now we know where it ends.

60
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.580
Okay.

61
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.260
Go check it out.

62
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.490
Okay, great.

63
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.220
Now, what we can as well is over this column that wraps everything up.

64
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.750
We can give a to this by simply alight it and use it.

65
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.330
Control and dots and wrap with.

66
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.290
Padded.

67
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.360
And we can give this ten year pardon of ten.

68
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.350
Go check it out.

69
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.930
Okay.

70
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.650
Great.

71
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.680
Okay.

72
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.330
And what we can basically just do to make this more understandable or more readable.

73
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.320
We can just.

74
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.980
Called this off.

75
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.930
So our clipboard and we can use another column.

76
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.950
They'll call a widget and the children and then paste this.

77
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.540
Let's see if this is going to change.

78
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.750
Okay.

79
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.920
Not a change.

80
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.630
Okay.

81
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.980
We can then copy this again.

82
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.080
And just duplicate this.

83
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.670
How the trachoma.

84
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.080
I'm going to get rid of this.

85
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.050
Is this a safe?

86
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.310
Okay.

87
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.130
And over here, we can say.

88
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.010
Email.

89
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.070
And is going to be.

90
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.700
Enter your email.

91
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.970
The key is culture, and that's the save.

92
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.360
And as well, you can see we have this two test fields.

93
00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:02.050
So over here we can give a size box, the sized box and height of ten.

94
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.080
Had you tried to cover a news conference to save?

95
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.420
Okay.

96
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.380
And lastly, we can as well.

97
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.550
Just copy this or you can basically type it yourself into that's for you to master the process.

98
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.270
Right.

99
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.580
So most of the time you really don't need to copy and paste.

100
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.240
You just have to type this yourself in order to master the process.

101
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.510
Right.

102
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.110
Okay.

103
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.340
And.

104
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.410
As well.

105
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.120
We need that size box.

106
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.460
So we're going to need to say size.

107
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.890
Size, box and height of.

108
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.030
Tell as well.

109
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.480
Okay.

110
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.940
Great.

111
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.380
Lastly, what we can do is we can have a button over year.

112
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.580
Right?

113
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.210
Okay.

114
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.010
So over here.

115
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.610
We can just create this bottle from scratch by saying Consider.

116
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.680
And we can give this container a width and the width.

117
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.280
What we're going to do is we're going to get the width of our screen.

118
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.000
Now, to do that, we just have to say is media query.

119
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.350
Dot of contest, dot size, dot width.

120
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.770
Now, this is going to give us the the width of our screen.

121
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.030
And what we can simply say is we can say -40.

122
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.230
That is after I get to the width of our screen, we simply want to -40 from it.

123
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.490
And as well, we can give a height to this, a height of 50.

124
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.440
That is how long the button is going to be.

125
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.980
And now we can have a decoration and a box decoration and also have access to some additional property.

126
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.180
And now we can say color and there's going to be colors, Dot said.

127
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.030
The key is control the safe.

128
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.960
But you can see over here as well, you can give us works.

129
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.550
Size works and heights of ten.

130
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.370
How the changeover in this country and excessive.

131
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.450
Okay.

132
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.360
I think 15 should be okay.

133
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.300
Okay.

134
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.160
And.

135
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.220
Over the Xbox declaration.

136
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.560
We can have access to this border videos.

137
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.330
And that was one of the reasons we have to use this bus decoration.

138
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.860
So now we can then say border radios, radius circular.

139
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:49.630
But if it is a secular 15, we simply don't want this to be that sharp.

140
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.600
Okay, great.

141
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.580
And we can as well had a trail cover and within the container.

142
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:05.900
We tend to consider we have the child, which is going to be a sensor with a sensor at the test you're

143
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.590
going to have.

144
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:14.390
And we can then have the child and the test, which is going to say sign up.

145
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.050
Okay.

146
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.750
He's come through and has to save and you're going sit over here.

147
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.950
Great.

148
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.740
Now we can have some style.

149
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.870
Maybe the test.

150
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.460
We just has a property known as Ty, and this is going to be test Ty.

151
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.330
We can, first of all change the color to colors the whites.

152
00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.520
And.

153
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.429
And we can increase the font size to probably 22.

154
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.030
And we can make this bold by saying four tweets.

155
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.490
And this is going to be false weights.

156
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:50.970
The boat.

157
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.450
Okay.

158
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.720
How did you recover and use control and then save?

159
00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.330
Okay.

160
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.470
Great.

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.430
We can't just say 20.

162
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.620
Or we can just use this.

163
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.430
Okay.

164
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.220
Now what we can as well do, we can change the colour of this icons.

165
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.100
So we're going to need to go up and the icon widget has a property known as color.

166
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.140
So we can see colors with white.

167
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.990
Okay as well.

168
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.480
The Icon widget has a property known as colour, so you can say colours to the whites as well.

169
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.610
You can use control and save how the trigger cover via it is controlled.

170
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.720
This a again.

171
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.700
Okay.

172
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.560
Looking great.

173
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.200
Okay, guys, see you the next section.
