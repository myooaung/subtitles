00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.830
Walker.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.900
Now, immediately these clicks on the article, but then this is going to go off.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.430
The cuts and the screen is going to go off and the product is going to be displayed.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.820
Okay.

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.860
So in this lecture, we are going to start designing the items screen.

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.310
Okay.

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.150
Now, to do this, we are going to need to go back to the code.

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.690
Okay.

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.870
Now, over the switch directory, we are going to create a new PHI and we are going to call this PHI

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.650
cards on this underscore.

12
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.530
It's a dead dot.

13
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.520
That's okay.

14
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.320
Now we can't just use this unless we get and as well we can call this.

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.600
I said that over here.

16
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.920
We then need to use control and dots in order to impart the material to that package.

17
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.280
Okay.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.920
Now we can use control and save.

19
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.190
Okay.

20
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.200
First of all, we're going to give this container a height.

21
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.170
That is how long it's going to be.

22
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.810
We can give it the height of 1 to 5.

23
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.840
Or probably 140.

24
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.160
Okay.

25
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.990
And then.

26
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.470
We can just go ahead and give a background color to this so we can have the Christian and the bus,

27
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.100
the Christian.

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.180
We can just.

29
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.590
Just contribute something this way.

30
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.010
Okay.

31
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.580
Okay.

32
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.680
First of all, we can give you what I would use to the container so we can see the videos.

33
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.760
Okay.

34
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.720
There's going to be border.

35
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.710
Radius.

36
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.100
That's okay.

37
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.840
So it's a maybe, but, uh.

38
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.530
Weather radios.

39
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.200
But I'm just going to type it again.

40
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.330
What?

41
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.050
Whatever it is, that's.

42
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.770
You can guess this circular.

43
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.330
Let's turn.

44
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.670
I did trachoma in this country and this a safe.

45
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.100
Okay.

46
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.670
Now as well, we can give a colour to this container.

47
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.930
So we can see color is going to be colors.

48
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.630
That's why I can then say, since this report is going to be revised, we can say Dots 70.

49
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.490
So sorry.

50
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.860
I think.

51
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.360
That's.

52
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.200
The White.

53
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.060
Okay.

54
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.630
Why?

55
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.290
70 not thought.

56
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.670
Okay.

57
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.820
Now you're gonna contribute to make the smaller than for the.

58
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.210
Now we can just go to the cards screen.

59
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.000
And for there now is a lot of this.

60
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.620
Okay, so cut screen.

61
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.560
I just know how to treat color.

62
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.870
Okay.

63
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.620
So just we're going to return to the cots empty for now to see what we are doing.

64
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.280
Cuts.

65
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.200
So we cut item.

66
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.780
Okay.

67
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.550
I'm just going to wait for this.

68
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.940
Okay.

69
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.390
Now a light and this country.

70
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.360
And that's okay.

71
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.950
Now.

72
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.090
So this.

73
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.660
And.

74
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.190
Okay.

75
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.630
It is over here.

76
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.790
I don't really know if you can see that much.

77
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.180
Okay.

78
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.830
Now what you can just do.

79
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.720
We can change the photo first.

80
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.410
Okay.

81
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.480
We can change the colour to red.

82
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.590
Red Sea sea.

83
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.240
Very clear.

84
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.030
Okay.

85
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.410
Now you can see the is.

86
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.080
The height of the continent is 140.

87
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.740
Okay, great.

88
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.730
Now we can then have a child.

89
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.080
So.

90
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.340
So we tend to content our rights that the content of a child.

91
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.340
The child is going to be a role because of are you able to have an image and all that we're going to

92
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.760
have.

93
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.700
It says to right.

94
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.420
And others.

95
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.810
Okay.

96
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.840
And as you know, this role can take multiple widgets.

97
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.980
It asks the children.

98
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.720
Okay, we can just use country.

99
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.310
And that's for us not to be controlled to make this way.

100
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.700
Okay.

101
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.290
Grades now for the first child.

102
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.080
We can then have a container.

103
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:40.460
A container and we can give this container in which I think they will want to see that is the size of

104
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.550
the container image.

105
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.870
Okay.

106
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.100
And then we can have a declaration and it's going to be box declaration.

107
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.280
And you can have the image now there's going to be decoration.

108
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.740
The Christian image.

109
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.160
Okay.

110
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.960
Now, in the future, I image is going to be coming from the Internet.

111
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.710
So it's going to be a network image.

112
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.610
But for now, we can just see image.

113
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.520
The tape is going to be.

114
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.120
Assets.

115
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.590
Image?

116
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.860
Well, definitely the future is going to be there.

117
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.100
That's walk.

118
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.620
Image.

119
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.000
Okay.

120
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.760
Now we're going to need to specify the parts.

121
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.230
So what I can do is I can go to the image that we.

122
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.670
Sorry, the assets images.

123
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.110
Okay.

124
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.280
We can just use the.

125
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.810
I have one that's PG.

126
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.250
Okay.

127
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.780
I think we have that.

128
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.040
We are.

129
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.150
That's okay.

130
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.050
Okay?

131
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.970
Yeah, we do.

132
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.690
So the location is assets.

133
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.110
Slash images, then slash a river.

134
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.480
So of.

135
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.140
See, we can just use the red dots.

136
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.180
P and G.

137
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.570
Okay.

138
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.310
Save.

139
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.910
Can clubs this.

140
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.170
Okay.

141
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.130
You can see the wire.

142
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.970
Now, what we can do is control B first.

143
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.330
Over here, we can't see fits.

144
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.300
It's going to be bucks fits.

145
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.120
Let's try to cover first and see that's going to look like.

146
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.290
Okay.

147
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.200
I think that's great.

148
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.370
It's.

149
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.780
It's just cover the entire container, okay?

150
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:46.100
What you can do is we can do some parsing and probably merge into this so we can then go to.

151
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.950
The container.

152
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.510
Okay.

153
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.940
I think I can just give.

154
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.100
Imagine it's near the edge.

155
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.750
It sets.

156
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.470
That's.

157
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.700
All sides.

158
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.140
And okay from the top, LeVar Burton writes every angle.

159
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.830
Okay.

160
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.910
I can see.

161
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.420
Okay.

162
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.860
I think this is way too far, but I think this is okay.

163
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.410
Right.

164
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.660
Okay.

165
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.360
We can just go ahead and change this to.

166
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.440
The whites and.

167
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.640
70.

168
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.090
Okay.

169
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.310
All.

170
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.560
Let's see what we can do.

171
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.720
That's why it's.

172
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.490
Kindrachuk doubts.

173
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.390
Okay.

174
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.980
I think we both agree.

175
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.810
Three of the hundred does the shade.

176
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.310
Okay.

177
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.020
I think.

178
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.390
Okay.

179
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.690
You have to try it out to see what's.

180
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.220
Okay, I think.

181
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.710
Some of the underage.

182
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.860
Okay.

183
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.090
Reasonable words.

184
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.250
The whites.

185
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.690
Of 70.

186
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.040
Okay.

187
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.350
I think it's a little bit cynical, a bit sent.

188
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.740
Okay.
