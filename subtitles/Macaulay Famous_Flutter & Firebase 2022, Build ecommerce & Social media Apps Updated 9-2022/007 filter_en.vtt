00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.760
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.650
Walker in the last lecture we had earlier used a row widget.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.480
The reason for this row widgets is because we want every widget that goes inside.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.050
It should be displayed horizontally.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.840
That is from left to right.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.600
Now, over here, you can see we have two widgets.

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.600
That is the test field and this filter icon.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
And we said we want both widgets to be displayed horizontally.

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.450
So that was the reason we have to use a row widgets.

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.900
Okay.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.500
Now, this is the first widget, right, that says Field.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.260
However, we open ends with a flexible widget.

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.570
So it takes the available space, right?

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.550
Okay, now we turn the row.

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.100
Right.

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.500
First of all, they're just going to need to it.

17
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.460
Come over here.

18
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.220
Okay.

19
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.730
Great.

20
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.160
Now over here, the test field, this flexible widget, you also need to have the to the cover.

21
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.260
Right.

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.780
Okay.

23
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.540
Now we are going to have another widget which is going to be for the image.

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.040
Now I'll just have to say is image thoughts.

25
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:20.070
SS Okay, right now for the location is going to be the hazards slash icons slash filter.

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.770
Towards PSG, there's going to be very big so we can reduce the whiteness.

27
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.150
So we're going to see weeks of.

28
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.990
25.

29
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.770
Okay.

30
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.570
Now use control s to save.

31
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.000
And go check it out.

32
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.620
Okay.

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.720
What we can do, it's is not said because it is it has a colour of whites.

34
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.650
So now what?

35
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.580
You can do that to have access to also property we can use.

36
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.160
Click on the like first days Katrina dots.

37
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.970
So I like to control it.

38
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.030
And that's they're able to resolve this with a container.

39
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.900
Right.

40
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.710
Okay.

41
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.669
Now you're going to use the declaration.

42
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.210
Then the box declaration.

43
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.510
The declaration is basically used for test field.

44
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.210
So there's going to be box declaration, right?

45
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.760
So digital cover first.

46
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.260
That's a get rid of that here.

47
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.310
Okay.

48
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.450
So we just have to see now is how long we want it to be close to black.

49
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.230
Right.

50
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.640
This country needs to save it.

51
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.820
Good.

52
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.450
Check it out.

53
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.990
Okay.

54
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.390
Get it away.

55
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.570
Now what we can all do, we can't give.

56
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.320
Imagine this.

57
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.810
You can't imagine it's going to be a hedge.

58
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.350
That's.

59
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.020
That's only that is only for the left of it is going to give it ten.

60
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.710
Okay as well.

61
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.220
They're going to give you a pardon to this.

62
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.110
Be a sets.

63
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.340
That's all.

64
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.400
This will give fodder for all sides.

65
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.330
That is applied in all 50.

66
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.470
We can now use controlled instances in good check.

67
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.420
It does okay.

68
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.640
They can see it's a bit bigger now.

69
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.250
Okay.

70
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.020
Because we're using the power that we should give space within.

71
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.440
Inside this box.

72
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.460
Inside this container.

73
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.630
Okay.

74
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.430
Now what you can do.

75
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.970
You can make this a bit it, right?

76
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.890
So to do that within the declaration that is evokes the commission, but we just have to say is border

77
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.440
radius is going to be border radius.

78
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.320
Whatever your standards are, we're just going to give you a radius of 15.

79
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.900
Okay.

80
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.310
Return has to save now.

81
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.320
Okay.

82
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.470
And go check it out.

83
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.420
Okay, great.

84
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.580
Okay.

85
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.920
Great.

86
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.370
Right.

87
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.970
Okay.

88
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.090
Okay.

89
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.230
Okay, guys, see you in in this lecture.
