Our guys welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.840
Regional creates the climate models.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.350
Okay, now over this model Zaatari regen the need to create a new phy and they're going to call this

4

FY comments, this section.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.190
Dots, dots.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.400
Okay, now we can use controlled beats to make this white.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.710
And the first step is to create a class.

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.500
And as well we can call this class comments.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.340
Okay.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.260
Now, these are the fields we need.

11
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.240
These are name of the user.

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.550
The comment itself, the dates the comment was posted, the likes, the footsie URL of the user and

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.940
so on.

14
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.360
Okay.

15
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.600
So right here, we're going to need to create those fields.

16
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.440
Okay.

17
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.190
First of all, we can see this string and it's going to be user name.

18
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.810
Right.

19
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.240

This is going to be the comments.

22
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.510
Okay.

23
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.860
Strange.

24
00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.850
This is going to be for okay, there's going to be final dates, the dates published.

25
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.019
Published by K.

26
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.420
Okay.

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.060
And.

28
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.500
Least.

29
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.530
Likes.

30
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.420

Right?

45
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.200

We need this and as well this.

56
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.300
I'm just going to get rid of this quickly.

57
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.860
Okay.

58
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.900

61
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.630
Required.

62
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.100
So.

63
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.310
Coma required.

64
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.130
This.

65
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.820
That what's.

66
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.830
Okay.

67
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.410
Profile photo and then your I.D. and I.D..

68
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.890
Okay.

69
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.020
So this is going to be required.

70
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.580
This starts.

71
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.230
Your I.D. and required.

72
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.640
This does.

73
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.560
I'd.

74
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.960
Okay.

75
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.190
Hi.

76
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.970
This okay?

77
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.690
Great.

78
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.930
Yes.

79
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.070
Control necessary now.

80
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.720
Okay, great.

81
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.950
Now, the next thing is to convert all this fields to a map, okay?

82
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.990
Because that's what's filed these aspects.

83
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.450
Okay.

84
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.520
Okay, now to do this.

85
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.180
Okay.

86
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.500
Yeah, we need to say map.

87
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.320
My.

88
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.030
It's going to be strange and as well die not make.

89
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.210
Okay.

90
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.690
And now we can say so.

91
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.040
J.

92
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.220
Son, I think you've said this before.

93
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.320
It is going to be a narrow function.

94
00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.130
And this.

95
00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.510
Okay.

96
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.160
Now, like I said, MOPP is basically something that has a property name on the property value.

97
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.240
If you're coming from JavaScript, this is known as object and you coming from Python.

98
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.600
This is known as dictionaries.

99
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.800
Okay.

100
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.110
Now we can say user name.

101
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.860
Username you can see.

102
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.010
And this is going to be what comments?

103
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.280
Comments.

104
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.890
Dates.

105
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.730
Okay.

106
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.540
Dates.

107
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.730
Published.

108
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.910
Well.

109
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.720
Least.

110
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.320
Dates was.

111
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.970
Published.

112
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.540
Okay.

113
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.690
And likes.

114
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.100
Likes.

115
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.220
Okay.

116
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.640
As well.

117
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.470
It's going to be for two.

118
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.560
I recorded Spotify.

119
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.430
For two.

120
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.160
And this is going to be profiled.

121
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.510
For two.

122
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.430
Okay.

123
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.570
And.

124
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.020
Your idea of the user and.

125
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.290
You already.

126
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.210
And lastly, I think the ID.

127
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.740
Okay.

128
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.330
I'd.

129
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.980
Okay.

130
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.140
Okay.

131
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.210
Now the next thing to do is to create.

132
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.290
Ah, the sections of each comment are going to be posted.

133
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.580
Right.

134
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.040
Okay.

135
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.870
And apart from that firebase aspects of this, so be something known as snapshots.

136
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.360
Right.

137
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.000
So we're going to need to create that.

138
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.230
Okay.

139
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.550
So over here.

140
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.540
We can then say static.

141
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.760
And comments.

142
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.870
Then we can call this from snob.

143
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.880
From snob.

144
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.660
You've seen all this before.

145
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.400
If you've forgotten why you're doing all this, you can just go back to that lecture.

146
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.600
Okay.

147
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.070
Now this movie documents.

148
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.650
Snapshot and snap.

149
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.640
You can just snap.

150
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.250
Okay.

151
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.660
Great.

152
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.680
Okay.

153
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.730
And now we can create, if able to store what we are going to be doing, this shirt is going to be equal

154
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.210
to.

155
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.250
This snap.

156
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.250
DOD data.

157
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.540
Okay.

158
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.290
The data and we can't look at it again as a map.

159
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.060
Map of string.

160
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.650
That is, all these fields are going to be strings and.

161
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.760
We don't care about the type of variable we want it to be any type of variable.

162
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.890
That's why we are saying dynamic.

163
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.180
The way it did this and then this.

164
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.280
Okay.

165
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.730
Sorry.

166
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.490
Okay.

167
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.730
And now we can dendrites on the comments model.

168
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.150
Comments.

169
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.940
Okay.

170
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.400
I'm just gonna do this again.

171
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.660
Okay.

172
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.150
Comments?

173
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.510
Okay.

174
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.410
Good.

175
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.210
Okay.

176
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.570
Now, for the user name, this is going to be snap.

177
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.940
Shot.

178
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.570
Username.

179
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.170
Okay.

180
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.260
All we can do is we can just copy this.

181
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.650
And.

182
00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.000
Is this?

183
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.200
And there's going to be what's.

184
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.050
Comments.

185
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.330
Make sure you don't make it a spelling mistake of a.

186
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.330
You can just rig this.

187
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.720
And Greg this.

188
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.250
And this, this.

189
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.220
And this.

190
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.540
Okay.

191
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.960
You can get rid of this.

192
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.130
And physics.

193
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.320
So.

194
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.290
Okay.

195
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.520
And yes, I can just do it for everything first.

196
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.020
Get rid of this.

197
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.520
This.

198
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.830
And his.

199
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.930
And --.

200
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.500
And paste.

201
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.010
Okay.

202
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.930
Now add this.

203
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.380
Okay.

204
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.130
Now we need to change each of every one of them.

205
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.510
Okay.

206
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.660
Copy this.

207
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.610
Is this?

208
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.570
Copy.

209
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.270
Pace.

210
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.110
Copy.

211
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.790
Pace.

212
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:09.860
Coffee.

213
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.520
Paste.

214
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.890
Copy.

215
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.940
Paste okay.

216
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:19.860
Okay.

217
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.640
No evidence to understand.

218
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.750
You can basically just go back to where we did this before or probably in the next year.

219
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.850
I'm going to try my best to explain why we did this again.

220
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.790
Okay.

221
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.520
First of all, over here, we created the fields and that's these orders.

222
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:37.840
We passed it on.

223
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.240
We passed it on to the constructor.

224
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.320
So whenever we call this.

225
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.740
Class we are going to need to pass in the value store this and the value we simply corrected.

226
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.580
It's a map.

227
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:50.940
Right.

228
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.330
Okay.

229
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.800
You know why we did this, right?

230
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.620
Because we also have set five ways.

231
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.430
That collection.

232
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.850
That's.

233
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.720
The dark.

234
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.000
The ads said there was a need to do something similar to this.

235
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:04.930
Right.

236
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.920
So that's why we have to do this here in the let's have a much more clean code.

237
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.490
And over here, we are specifying that every comment is known as well as snapshots.

238
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.380
Right.

239
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.890
Okay, great.

240
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.260
Okay, guys said investiture.
