00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.380
In this lecture, we are going to design the place, order screen, and we are also going to be having

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.330
the details of the user via OC.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.950
So what we can do is we can go to the profile screen where we have that feature builder profile screen

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:37.560
and we can copy from this override to, to, to to to the scaffold scaffold or via use controller and

7
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.530
c to copy and back to.

8
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.960
The place order screen.

9
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.880
Place order.

10
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.790
Where are you?

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.100
Please.

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.560
Order!

13
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.920
Place!

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.380
Order!

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.150
Okay, this is it.

16
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.630
All right.

17
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.030
And we can then get rid of this override and this as well.

18
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.040
And paste.

19
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.580
Okay.

20
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:07.910
And now we need to import all this package light and use control and dot to import.

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.450
Okay.

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.270
Taking longer in part.

23
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.180
And also, we need to import this.

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.850
Okay.

25
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.740
And you can see we have this error.

26
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.010
First of all, we have to close this scaffold.

27
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.180
And then we need to close the future border.

28
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.570
Had this had this again and one parenthesis then had your semicolon.

29
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.680
And I think we need another.

30
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.960
Okay, great.

31
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.880
Okay.

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.120
And over here you can see we have this error.

33
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.890
And the reason for this error is basically asking for the else.

34
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.190
You can see why we said if we finish low, then we want to basically display the data.

35
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.580
Right?

36
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.540
And over here we have to say ls return.

37
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.910
Return.

38
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.430
This is going to be material and order to have that white background.

39
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.880
I think you've seen this before material.

40
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.650
And we can then have a child.

41
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.690
The child is going to be a center with that.

42
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.860
And we can have another child, which is going to be a secular, secular, secular progress indicator.

43
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.480
And we can give this a color of colors that assign.

44
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.900
Cause a sign.

45
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.490
Okay.

46
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.580
So what we are basically saying, if is if it's still low, then we want to show this secular progress

47
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.380
indicator.

48
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.900
You can see why we are basically saying if it is equal, Don, that is if we have successfully finished

49
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.930
retrieving the data, then we want to display.

50
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.740
It helps if we are still trying to display that data.

51
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.030
We want to show a secular progress indicator to tell the user that, hey, please, you need to wait

52
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.890
till we fetch that data.

53
00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.020
Okay, now within the scaffold, we can have a harbour bar.

54
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.940
Harbour and we can give this harbour a grand colour of maybe colours that grey and we can add some shades

55
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.250
to this maybe shade of red and we can get rid of the elevation by saying zero.

56
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.640
Okay.

57
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.900
Is control and has to save.

58
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.800
And go check this out.

59
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.220
You should see it's over.

60
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.660
Over here.

61
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.930
Okay.

62
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.240
Okay, great.

63
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.540
And we the scaffold.

64
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.440
First of all, we can just have a train come out of it and let's have a very good format.

65
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.750
And within the scaffold, as you know, it has a property known as body.

66
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.980
And for the body, it's going to be a column, column widget.

67
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.920
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets, which are going to be displayed horizontally.

68
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.630
So it has these children property.

69
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.650
And the first side of the column is going to be a container.

70
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.650
And for this container, we can give it a height of maybe 90.

71
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.029
And we can give this a decoration in order to have access to lots of property the container has.

72
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.950
And box decoration.

73
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.490
Right.

74
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:21.730
Okay.

75
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.880
We can give this a color of colors.

76
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.170
The white.

77
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.050
And also we can give this some rounded shape by saying border radius and this is going to be border

78
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.980
radius.

79
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.960
What do we do as the scorer of maybe ten?

80
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.730
We don't want it to be that round.

81
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.800
And what we can also do is within the scaffold that is over here, we can give it a background color.

82
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.050
You can then see broken color.

83
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.670
We can also see colors that gray.

84
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.850
And also we can have a shade of red.

85
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.450
Use control.

86
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.590
And has to save.

87
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.050
And you see you can see you can see we have this container right with k sim school.

88
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.110
And we can wrap this column with a pardon to give some space within each edges.

89
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.590
And we can just say maybe ten is okay.

90
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.800
Let's go check it out.

91
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.130
Okay.

92
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.360
Okay, great.

93
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.200
Okay.

94
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.840
This will basically be for the user detail, like the name of the user, the name of the user, and

95
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.230
so on.

96
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.440
That is this container.

97
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.030
Okay.

98
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.520
And we can have another container.

99
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.380
Add your newcomer and you can just give us a space between this container and the other container.

100
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.520
We are going to have container.

101
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.990
And we can give a height of maybe 20.

102
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.020
And for this container before we before we use this container, we're going to use an expanded widget.

103
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.650
The reason for this expanded widget is we want the container to take the available space.

104
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.640
And for the child, okay, I'm just going to use a container first in order for you to see this very

105
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.900
well container.

106
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.800
Container.

107
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.740
And I'm just going to go ahead and say declaration and box declaration.

108
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.340
Okay.

109
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.270
We can give this a colour of colours that white as well.

110
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.930
Call us at White and we can have a declaration.

111
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.490
Sorry.

112
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.870
Okay.

113
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.540
Yeah, we already have that declaration.

114
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.800
We can then have.

115
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.550
A border.

116
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.720
A border radius.

117
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.690
But border videos.

118
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.430
Thought maybe secular of ten.

119
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.300
Okay.

120
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:07.270
And what we can do is we can give a height to this container, maybe heights of Haiti.

121
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.620
Okay.

122
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.800
Use control.

123
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.350
And as the save and go check is going to look like.

124
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.060
Look, you can see it over here.

125
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.140
But what we can also do is we can get rid of this hides we have over.

126
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.500
And we can rob this container with something known as a standard widget.

127
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:36.420
What this will do is it will make that container have the rest of the screen its control necessary now

128
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.410
and go check it out.

129
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.990
Who is going to take the available specs?

130
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.560
Many.

131
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.230
Okay.

132
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.930
Sounds cool.

133
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.980
You can sit over there.

134
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.120
Right.

135
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.420
Okay.

136
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.060
Checking the available specs.

137
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.700
And remember.

138
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.390
Remember, we are using the Padden to wrap everything up.

139
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.360
And that's why you can see this space.

140
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.770
Okay.

141
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.460
So go.

142
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:08.190
And what we can then do is we can have a bottom sheds within the scaffold outside the harbour.

143
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.540
We can then have a bottom sheet and.

144
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.510
This is going to be a container which is going to create this bottle from scratch again.

145
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:26.510
And we can give this bottle in a height of maybe 35, 35, and we can give this a width in order to

146
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.480
make the weight more responsive.

147
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:37.370
We can get the width of our screen by saying media query of context dot size, then that width, and

148
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.250
we just want to times it by maybe zero.

149
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:49.040
The seats make it much more bigger and then we can add the decoration and the box decoration.

150
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.490
And in box decoration.

151
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.120
We can give this a color of colors that.

152
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.070
Does sign.

153
00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.970
Okay, great.

154
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.710
And we can make this a bit crowded by having a broader radius.

155
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.690
This is going to be border radius.

156
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.700
The circular.

157
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:17.180
The circle are of maybe ten or maybe or maybe ten.

158
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.730
Okay.

159
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.520
Had this over.

160
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.360
You can see it over here.

161
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.430
Okay, Cisco.

162
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:37.810
And what we can just do is look, first of all, we send the container.

163
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.000
We can then have a child.

164
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.490
The child is going to be the material.

165
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.890
Material button.

166
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.390
Material button.

167
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:55.400
The material button has a property known as on press because we are going to make it clickable and then

168
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.830
hide your cover the child.

169
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.130
Then there's going to be a test which is going to say confirm.

170
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.000
Okay.

171
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.800
Okay.

172
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.860
Go check it out.

173
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.510
You should sit over.

174
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.340
Okay.

175
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.830
And we can maybe start this.

176
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.600
This is going to be test I.

177
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.680
And.

178
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.890
CALLER Sorry.

179
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.210
Yeah.

180
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.360
CALLER This is going to be called a state wide.

181
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.620
And I think we're missing one.

182
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:31.300
Okay.

183
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.920
Cause that's what I think we're missing.

184
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.000
Okay.

185
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.460
These containers are safe to format.

186
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.390
And we can increase the font size to.

187
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.390
Font size that 18 thin.

188
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.650
Okay.

189
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.400
Great.

190
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.300
Okay.

191
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.100
We could also make this bold by saying font with.

192
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.240
Font width.

193
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.730
Found with the boat and this OC.

194
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:13.300
And also we can't make sure the test is within the center of the container.

195
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.740
To do this, we can wrap this and test with a sensor widget.

196
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.550
Okay.

197
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.430
Simcoe.

198
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:33.360
And also what we can just do is we can wrap this container with a widget and we can then see it cross

199
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.460
us and then cross us.

200
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:43.010
Cross assess element dots center to take it to the centre.

201
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.180
Okay.

202
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.530
Not did not go.

203
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.710
So this should be main houses element.

204
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.620
Right.

205
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:53.970
Okay.

206
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.680
So for that main --.

207
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.030
Main axis alignment.

208
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.050
Main axis alignment the center.

209
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.510
Remember, the main access alignment is going to work oppositely for the column of.

210
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.270
Okay, Cisco.

211
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.990
Maybe 90.

212
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.730
Okay.

213
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.950
Okay.

214
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.270
Great.

215
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.450
And make it more bigger.

216
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.600
And what we can do is.

217
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.540
What's in this cardboard.

218
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:38.350
We can wrap this with a safe area, so make sure we don't go very, very close to this hedges.

219
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.910
So we are going to wrap this scaffold, which is safe.

220
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.020
Safe.

221
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.760
Here we are.

222
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.630
Okay.

223
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:53.030
And lastly, we are going to wrap this with a pardon.

224
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.430
Wrap with padding.

225
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.660

226
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:05.180
A light and use control and wrap with pardon pardon maybe ten is okay.

227
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470

229
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.300
That seems cool.

230
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.860
Right.

231
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.210
Looking great.

232
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.640
And maybe instead of ten, we can just wrap this with 15.

233
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.510
And check this out.

234
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.280
