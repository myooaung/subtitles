00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.890
Welcome.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.010
In this lecture, we're going to create the settlements.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.689
Okay.

5
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.690
In order to do this, we need to go to the provider directory.

6
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.800
Okay?

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.290
And then the products that that PHI and now we can then use Contra a bit to make this white.

8
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.300
Okay, now over here.

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.490
What we can do is we can basically just copy and paste this because it's going to be similar.

10
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.120
What we can do is we can't redo this from scratch.

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.510
Okay.

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.530
So now we can just go ahead and specify it's going to be a type of list and it's going to be a type

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.140
of product model.

14
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.720
So this users are going to be able to search for products.

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.320
Okay.

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.370
And now we can call this function search.

17
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.430
We re.

18
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.320
Okay.

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.310
And we're going to pass in a dynamic fable and a little causeway will search.

20
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.990
Test is test.

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.890
This is referring to the imputes of the user.

22
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.379
Okay, great.

23
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.740
Now we can just go ahead to create a variable to store the value.

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.220
Okay.

25
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.580
And we can call this on square search list and it's going to be equal to the underscore products.

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.980
This Co-products.

27
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.070
And now we can see dots where.

28
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.960
Where.

29
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.620
Okay.

30
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.970
Where elements.

31
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.010
We want users to be able to search for products based on the product name or the product title so we

32
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.580
can see where.

33
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.900
Elements, dots.

34
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.440
Tie two and we can convert this to a lowercase.

35
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.930
So maybe these are types, type types and uppercase.

36
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.970
We're gonna need to convert it to lowercase.

37
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.410
Okay, so whatever it is, we are just going to convert it to a lowercase, and we can then say dots

38
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.880
contains.

39
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.220
Those qualities.

40
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.900
This search.

41
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.200
Search.

42
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.860
Tests.

43
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.770
Okay.

44
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.540
That is if what these are is tapping into the.

45
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000
Type into the test fields is according to this.

46
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.930
Then we need to convert this to.

47
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.210
Iraqis as well.

48
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.790
And now we can see.

49
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.270
Lots to list.

50
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.610
Okay, great.

51
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.620
Okay.

52
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.680
This is basically it's nice country and save.

53
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.270
Okay.

54
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.690
And now we can then return.

55
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.540
We turn on the sky search.

56
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.940
Says This isn't a sign.

57
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.310
Okay, we need to put this in the list.

58
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.910
So grab this with this.

59
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.460
This and then hot Siri does.

60
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.880
Okay, I'm just gonna try to sign up quickly to show you this.

61
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.370
Okay?

62
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.730
Okay.

63
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.740
I think I have.

64
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.330
A user known as.

65
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.070
Okay.

66
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.720
Minimum to try to explain this.

67
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.320
Okay.

68
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.090
Now, over here.

69
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.510
We created a functions card search query.

70
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.610
And we specify it's just a type of list and as well it is a type of the products model since users are

71
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.790
going to be searching for products that over year.

72
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.560
What we did was to create a dynamic variable, this very by simply referring to the inputs of the user.

73
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.300
That is what's the size of the type in into the test field.

74
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.470
Okay.

75
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.070
And over here we created a variable as well called search this in order to store the results of this.

76
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.800
In the last year.

77
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.829
We have this variable called underscore projects, which is basically defined at the top.

78
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:29.800
And now we are seeing where Ellen wins the title and we are converting it to a list probably is on my

79
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.560
type is looking for Gucci.

80
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.490
Right.

81
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.050
So you're going to need to cover that.

82
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.830
So what's.

83
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.050
It's a lowercase.

84
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.370
That's a lowercase.

85
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.790
Okay.

86
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.190
And we are checking if it's contains what's the switch that's missing?

87
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.820
If this if what it uses tap into if what the user is typing is equal to what we have in our setup in

88
00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:03.260
our database, that is the type two or if such product it is, then we just want to return it.

89
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.310
Okay.

90
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.480
You understand?

91
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.140
Okay.

92
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:15.410
So whenever we call this search query, now we're going need to pass in the value to this trade what

93
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.460
we have over here.

94
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.970
Okay.

95
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.120
Okay.

96
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.480
Hopefully understand.

97
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.220
But if we don't, I think is still fine.

98
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.840
But as the process goes, you still have a lot of chance to understand it.

99
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.260
Okay.

100
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.840
Okay, guys, say it in this lecture.
