00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.930
Nice work.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.320
In this lecture, we are going to continue from where we start.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.100
Okay.

4
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.100
Now over here we are going to have an icon.

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.020
Then on top of that icon, they're going to have a color of black on top of.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.840
It's something like this.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.840
Okay.

8
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.470
Now, we had earlier used a row, but the reason for the row is because we want all widgets decided

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.930
to be displayed horizontally.

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.800
That is from left to right.

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.700
Okay.

12
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.360
Now, to do this, it needs to go back to previous record.

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.910
Now.

14
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.960
This is the road yet.

15
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.610
This is the risk test.

16
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.390
Right.

17
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.110
Okay.

18
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.340
So, first of all, we're just going to give it a comma.

19
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.840
It's really a comma.

20
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.280
Then use control this to save an editor or to format this.

21
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.120
Okay.

22
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.120
Now, so we're going to give it away.

23
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.530
Okay.

24
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.410
Now we are going to have an icon right then on top of that icon.

25
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.870
They're going to have this black hole on top of it.

26
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.980
They like to place widgets on top of widgets.

27
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.500
They're going to be using a widget known as Stack.

28
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.770
Mind you, everything is referred to widgets and flutter.

29
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.960
So this does fine as a widget as well.

30
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.950
Okay.

31
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.160
So after this reach test, they're going to have this stack.

32
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.510
Okay.

33
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.680
Now, this stack can't take and multiple widgets see it as this to it.

34
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.760
To do it.

35
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.360
Okay.

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.490
Okay.

37
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.140
They're just going to use a container.

38
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.700
So we have access to more additional property, such as ice padding and all this.

39
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.270
Okay.

40
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.420
Now for the child, they're going to have an icon widget.

41
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.800
For the I call the widget.

42
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.490
It's just going to be icons dots charting.

43
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.490
Churches are this call cards on this call hotline.

44
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.610
Okay, now we can give a call to this icon.

45
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.630
We can change the caller to call us Dot Greer.

46
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.040
Okay.

47
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.850
I think we have this online.

48
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.950
I did camera and use consciousness to save.

49
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.590
Okay.

50
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.200
Now, I think this is way too vague.

51
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.440
You can't change this to 24 and this to 22.

52
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.430
Okay.

53
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.680
Go check it out now.

54
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.980
Okay.

55
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.550
You can see the wire, right?

56
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.910
Okay.

57
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.150
Now what we can do, we can make a display between these sites.

58
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.640
So what you can do is over this row.

59
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.390
What would you say?

60
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.900
I have to say is main alignment.

61
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.430
Main axis alignment.

62
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.430
The space between.

63
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.970
Okay.

64
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.380
Now go check what it does.

65
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.650
Okay.

66
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.880
Great.

67
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.310
Now we can give a pardon to this.

68
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.140
So that was one of the reasons we use we have to use the container so we can see today.

69
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.100
Edge inserts.

70
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.850
That's all.

71
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.380
We just want to give change for all sides.

72
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.150
That is left, right, bottom.

73
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.610
No, that's okay.

74
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.830
So great.

75
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.190
Now, the next thing we're going to do is we are going to have the black hole on top of this.

76
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.480
Right.

77
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.860
Okay.

78
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.720
Remember, that was the reason why we use this stock.

79
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.080
It basically uses top to place widgets on top widgets.

80
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.560
Okay.

81
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.690
Now, how do you try to come out first either to cover these channels to save.

82
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.340
Now.

83
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.850
This is the container.

84
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.240
They know that's a place.

85
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.720
Widget themselves.

86
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.630
This container, what we just have to do is after this container, rather than have something known

87
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.390
as position for the ship.

88
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.460
Okay.

89
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.890
For the child is also going to be a container.

90
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.740
So we have access to some additional property such as Colon Heights and others.

91
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.160
Okay.

92
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.350
So for the color of these, the declaration is going to be both declaration for declaration.

93
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.860
Okay.

94
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.400
So you're going to see color.

95
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.390
There is going to be colors but black for now.

96
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.260
Okay.

97
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.390
There are going to give a heart to this color.

98
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.000
That is how long it's going to be.

99
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.270
And those are going to a weight.

100
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.210
That is why it is going to be so.

101
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.080
We're going to see a height of tan that is all along.

102
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.780
Then I got to see Weeds of tan as well.

103
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.770
That is our white.

104
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.670
Okay.

105
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.030
It is unnecessary.

106
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.890
Then go check it out.

107
00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.360
Okay.

108
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.500
Now, you can see today.

109
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.830
Now, what you can do is we can take it to the right so we can see right turn.

110
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.910
Okay.

111
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.710
Now go check it out and see what does this is going to go to the right.

112
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.500
Okay.

113
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.080
Now, we can take it a bit to the thought or I think here.

114
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.360
So what you can do is you can set up.

115
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.930
Okay.

116
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.880
Okay.

117
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.590
He's got this.

118
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.640
I see what it does.

119
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.270
Okay, great.

120
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.720
Now we can make this a little bit round it or around.

121
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.760
Okay.

122
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.470
To do this, we just have to say now is to say shift is going to reverse shift.

123
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.960
That sickle.

124
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.640
Controversy.

125
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.730
Go see what it does.

126
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.910
Okay, I think.

127
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.800
It's not that round.

128
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.840
Try to save.

129
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.130
Okay.

130
00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.800
Great.

131
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.200
Like I said.

132
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.700
Right.

133
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.190
Okay.

134
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.280
It's looking great.

135
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.030
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
