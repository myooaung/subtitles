00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
Worker in this lecture.

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.510
Display the product name.

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.400
But before then, recently I got a portrait in which we drastically affect the sales of my course.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.370
So, please, if you have an issue with this course, please do let me know if you have such.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.040
Okay.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.320
So now what we're going to do in this lecture is over here, you're going to have the product name,

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.800
and over here we can have the civil rights icon.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.730
Okay, now to do this, we need to go back to our equal rights.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.060
Okay?

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.880
Now, we can easily just create a new holder for this that is over this detail directory.

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.550
We can create a new directory called We did in Nevada, which is we can create a new file.

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.240
What's the case?

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.260
Digital rights.

15
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.850
Okay, so we're just going to do it over here.

16
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.330
Okay.

17
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.300
Now, this is this task, which is and we basically use this task in order to place this.

18
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.410
A true icon on top of this image.

19
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.720
Right.

20
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.660
So we are going to need to combat from the stack.

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.320
So what you can do is you can add a comma and a way.

22
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.910
How to drink color and use control needs to see.

23
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.290
Okay.

24
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.920
Now, what I said is right.

25
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.820
We're going to have.

26
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.480
The product name and overlay.

27
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.520
We're going to have the.

28
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.360
Civil rights icon.

29
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.650
Right.

30
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.990
Okay.

31
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.700
So Assad is stark.

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740
We can now contain the crisis to the party property.

33
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.890
Okay, then the child is going to be a roll we get.

34
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.430
Okay.

35
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.670
Then you can take multiple widgets it as it should read.

36
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.550
We can just use control B to make this work.

37
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.210
And the first widget is going to be a test.

38
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.990
And it's going to be close.

39
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.510
That's productive.

40
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.480
Right now, we can just see the two string.

41
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.400
I also had shown you how to avoid these two string writes the.

42
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.650
Okay.

43
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.220
I think we need this.

44
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.160
Okay, now we can give some style to this.

45
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.740
You can see test stay.

46
00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.250
Okay.

47
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.700
Then we can see once.

48
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.400
Size of 32.

49
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.050
Additional color and fonts, which is going to be fonts which.

50
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.970
That boat.

51
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.370
Okay, great.

52
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.350
Now we can.

53
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.570
How did you come here so late?

54
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.700
And is control necessary and good?

55
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.940
Check what you just did.

56
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.280
You're going to sit here, okay.

57
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.040
Now we can give some breathing space.

58
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.510
You can see it's way too close.

59
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.500
To the top and to the left.

60
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.600
That was the reason we used the container.

61
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.680
So we have access to the pardon property so we can see.

62
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.120
Pardon.

63
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.990
Going to be.

64
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.470
And.

65
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.080
And so it's just symmetric.

66
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.040
Now you're going to argue for the horizontal and vertical horizontal axis to top the bottom.

67
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.630
So you can see evidence of 25.

68
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.400
I'm just going to use control necessary to see what it does.

69
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.910
So this is going to go down a bit.

70
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.630
Okay.

71
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.280
So he wasn't asked to do it.

72
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.140
Left and right.

73
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.470
Right.

74
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.560
Okay.

75
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.140
Now the vertical has to do with top and bottom.

76
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.400
Right.

77
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.620
Okay.

78
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.330
So we can take this to the bottom, ladies.

79
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.120
The vertical.

80
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.020
So vertical or ten.

81
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.370
Okay.

82
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.720
Are the trencor.

83
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.580
So he's going to go down now.

84
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.760
Okay, great.

85
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.490
Now you can then have the icon.

86
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.950
So this is the yet and this is the hand of the first widget.

87
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.830
That is the test.

88
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.780
We can then have the trachoma and then we can have a container.

89
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.570
Okay.

90
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.550
And each side is going to be high.

91
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.910
Calm.

92
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.110
Then I.

93
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.650
Cause.

94
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.140
Okay.

95
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.890
I can't.

96
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.400
I caused that faithful.

97
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.600
Right.

98
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.960
Okay.

99
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.750
Right.

100
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.140
Okay.

101
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.560
I think it is there.

102
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.560
Okay.

103
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.660
Okay.

104
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.750
I think it's like this.

105
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.070
Okay.

106
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.670
Okay.

107
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.550
I'll give you a color and look what it does.

108
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.260
You're going to see the way now.

109
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.690
Okay.

110
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.230
So over here, what we can do is we can then say we have this alignment, so.

111
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.040
Main alignment, main axis.

112
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.020
Elements.

113
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.600
The space between.

114
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.990
Okay.

115
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.910
Great.

116
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.650
It's going to be a no.

117
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.960
Okay.

118
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.490
Then we can change the colour so we can then see colour.

119
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.160
It's going to cost the thread.

120
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.500
Right?

121
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.860
Okay.

122
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.210
And go check it out.

123
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.620
Right.

124
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.440
We can also see if we can change the size.

125
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.830
You can see this icon widget as the size property as well.

126
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.620
So you can see 15 to make this more.

127
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.080
Okay.

128
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.870
Okay.

129
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.130
Now, one last thing we're going to do is we're going to change your opacity of this white background.

130
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.770
So we're going to go to the top.

131
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.950
Okay.

132
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.090
We're going to see where that knife.

133
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.380
Okay.

134
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.790
Let's see what it does.

135
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.580
Okay.

136
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.600
I think this is okay.

137
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.960
Right.

138
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.280
I think he's okay.

139
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.650
Right.

140
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.750
And we can just go with it and see.

141
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.350
If that is okay by us.

142
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.700
Okay.

143
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.080
I think this is okay.

144
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.110
Right.

145
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.700
So we can go back, click on this and click on this.

146
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.520
Guess it's this great.

147
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.660
Click on this and think of this.

148
00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.040
Okay.

149
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.080
Walking through.

150
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.020
Right.

151
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.400
Okay.

152
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.870
Okay.

153
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.880
So if we have an issue with this course and the issue with the lecture, you don't understand these

154
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.110
to let me know, because evaluating would definitely affect my course.
