00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.690
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.120
In this lecture, users are going to be able to pick video from either gallery or camera, and as well

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.090
they're going to be able to click on this in order to cancel.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.570
Okay, not to do this, they're going to need to go back to obvious record and then they have the video

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.340
screen and then we can use control and B to make this wide.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.900
Okay.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.940
Now over here, we are going to create a function and we are going to call this function peak video.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.730
Okay.

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.840
Now, the process of picking video from gallery is going to be similar with the process of picking video

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.860
and camera.

12
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.610
So what we can do is we can make this reusable.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay.

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
So we're going to pass in this source.

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.380
That's the location on how we're going to pick that video.

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.510
So you can see as RC and as well we can specify the type.

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.020
It is a type of image.

18
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.670
Source.

19
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.080
Okay.

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.250
Grids as well.

21
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.010
This is going to take in the context.

22
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.910
And we can as well specify the type which is a type of beauty contest.

23
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.910
Okay.

24
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.430
Great.

25
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.410
Now via.

26
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.600
They're going to find her and you're going to create a rainbow card with you.

27
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.300
It's going to be equal to first of all, there's a future.

28
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.930
We need to use the async and where we can see our IDs, then we're going to be using that image picker.

29
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.110
That image picker has a mentor known as pick video.

30
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.410
You're going to see this shot the so we can see image picker.

31
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.100
Image Flickr.

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.440
That's peak.

33
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.510
Video you can see okay now for the source is going to be this source as.

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.530
Our seat.

35
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.900
Okay, great.

36
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.180
Now hold your semicolon.

37
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.540
Okay.

38
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.860
Now the next step.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.900
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to check if the user actually picked the video.

40
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.330
Okay.

41
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.220
So they are going to use and use it so we can see if video.

42
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.930
Is not occur to know that this user aspect of video.

43
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.780
Or simply saying if the video is that empty.

44
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.890
Right.

45
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.270
Okay.

46
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.470
If the video is not a quarter low, then we're going to go to a new screen.

47
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.980
Okay.

48
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.870
So we are going to create that screen.

49
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.680
So over here, they're going to create a new screen part of.

50
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.880
But the score, we can just call this off on the score screen.

51
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.720
Those darts.

52
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.220
In this screen.

53
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.650
The video is going to be displayed and.

54
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.450
This is going to be how they capture that video.

55
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.020
Okay.

56
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.570
Boy, they're going be doing this now.

57
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.870
Okay.

58
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.520
For they now is going to be able to navigate to this screen.

59
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.910
Okay.

60
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.530
So now we can create two stateless widgets.

61
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.500
And as well you can call this find.

62
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.290
Screen.

63
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.180
Okay, and apply a light and use control and dots in order to impart the material to the dead package.

64
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.840
Okay, now we need to go back to the video screen.

65
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.130
Okay.

66
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.390
So if it is not a quartz knob, that's the user actually as a video.

67
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.950
Okay.

68
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.960
Then what we can then do?

69
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.060
We can say Navigator.

70
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.680
We can just go ahead and say navigate to the it's push.

71
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.110
Okay.

72
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.420
You can see as the shot from the that should be okay.

73
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.390
Or the roots or roots whatever you call it, is going to be my severe.

74
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.360
Page.

75
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.770
ROBERTS okay.

76
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.770
As well.

77
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.680
It is going to take in the contest.

78
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.570
Okay.

79
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.220
And you can use an arrow function for this.

80
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.860
Or we can just use this.

81
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.370
I just recall on an within here we can't see written.

82
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.030
Of.

83
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.530
Confirm screen.

84
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.110
That is only if the video was actually picked.

85
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.960
Okay, great.

86
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.480
Now, remember, we made this dynamic, right?

87
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.710
So what we can.

88
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.510
What we can turn to is.

89
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.780
Over year.

90
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.180
Right we can.

91
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.550
Use an our function.

92
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.590
And we're going to call the peak.

93
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.550
Peak video.

94
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.030
McCann.

95
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.030
Now you can see it wants to surpass the source of all the.

96
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.640
Of all the witches of the peaks, it's going to be image.

97
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.370
Source.

98
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.310
The art gallery.

99
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.750
Okay.

100
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.460
Great.

101
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.890
Okay.

102
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.780
As well.

103
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.640
We need, I think.

104
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.250
Oh.

105
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.670
Say he's going to have to hold to this as well.

106
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.900
Video.

107
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.760
Okay, so.

108
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.140
As well they're going to do for this.

109
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.300
Okay.

110
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.310
You can use an arrow function.

111
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.170
And this is going to be peak.

112
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.190
Video.

113
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.820
Okay.

114
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.490
There's going to be image source.

115
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.920
Then the camera.

116
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.510
Okay.

117
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.580
Great.

118
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.740
Now for this.

119
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.800
Okay.

120
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.240
We also have this.

121
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.470
Okay.

122
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.370
So you can do.

123
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.570
We can use the navigator dot.

124
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.950
Pop.

125
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.780
Okay.

126
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.400
Okay.

127
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.000
Great.

128
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.680
Okay.

129
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.450
Now, let's try to.

130
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.290
Jack.

131
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.190
What you just did.

132
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.770
Okay.

133
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.720
But this.

134
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.080
Okay.

135
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.310
Well, let's just.

136
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.850
Let's.

137
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.280
We start this.

138
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.420
Okay.

139
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.340
But we started.

140
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.930
Okay.

141
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.440
If may not use that, then.

142
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.910
Okay.

143
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.540
Okay.

144
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.730
Now click on this.

145
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.210
Okay.

146
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.780
Sorry.

147
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.090
Click on this and click on Gallery.

148
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.090
This is going to take us to a gallery.

149
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.990
Okay.

150
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.090
Now, currently we don't have any video and not so hard a video.

151
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.510
Okay.

152
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.850
I currently have one, but if we don't know how to do this, all you have to do is to go to your thigh

153
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.350
and over this you can drag and use alternate and tap.

154
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.960
To navigate to your android.

155
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.970
Then just have to leave this over.

156
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.730
I think our idea of it or you can just close this that's is.

157
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.640
All that and.

158
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.850
I think that's okay.

159
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.840
Okay.

160
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.450
And you can just drag it.

161
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.460
Okay.

162
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.900
And of course, you can see my copy.

163
00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.320
Okay.

164
00:07:59.560 --> 00:07:59.960
Copy.

165
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.620
Okay.

166
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.480
That's basically it.

167
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.110
Okay.

168
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.290
So I'm going to click on this history.

169
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:08.990
Okay.

170
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.490
This.

171
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.450
Okay.

172
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.100
Okay.

173
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.760
Is that a pic of you again?

174
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.930
Just going to wait for this.

175
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.770
Okay.

176
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.370
Okay.

177
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:35.909
This.

178
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:38.590
Okay.

179
00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.730
Now pick.

180
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.480
Okay.

181
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:42.929
You can see.

182
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.450
Took us back to the.

183
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.160
The vampire screen.

184
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.880
What we can do is over the course of screen.

185
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.330
Screen.

186
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.150
You can't just use this comfort.

187
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:02.840
Scaffold.

188
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.490
And you can have.

189
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.190
