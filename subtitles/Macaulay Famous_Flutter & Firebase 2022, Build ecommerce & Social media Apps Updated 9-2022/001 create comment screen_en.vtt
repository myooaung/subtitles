00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.690
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.570
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.530
In this section, we are going to create the comment functionality.

4
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.540
Okay, then how does it do this?

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.900
We're gonna need to go to this crazy tree, and over those trees, that tree are going to need to create

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.740
a new phi.

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.840
And we're going to call this Phi comments on this car screen.

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.630
And then the section, the darts.

9
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.410
Okay.

10
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.620
And now we can then use Contra and B to make this wide.

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.530
And over here we can create a stateless widget and as well we can call this comment screen.

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.520
Now over here we need to add light and then use contra and dots.

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.000
In that same part you might see that that package.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.420
Okay.

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.410
Now instead of returning their content, our widgets, in order for us to have access to some lots more

16
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.100
privacy.

17
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.590
What we can do is we can return a widget known as comfort.

18
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.140
Okay.

19
00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.540
Now.

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.730
Zeno Discomfort has a property known as body.

21
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.540
And for the body this can be a center widget in for the center widget.

22
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.220
It has the child.

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.860
Okay.

24
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.300
All right.

25
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.780
And this can then be it says which is which is just going to say for now, comments.

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.130
Screen.

27
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.030
And over here you can have some tie.

28
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.380
It's going to be test tie.

29
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.680
To tie.

30
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.470
Okay.

31
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.910
To start, we can just give the font size to be 20 and over.

32
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.410
You make sure you have the same cover and then use control and s to save as well.

33
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.350
You can add the to come out of.

34
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130
Okay great.

35
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.460
That this to do is to go back to the video screen and we can then use control and B to make this weight.

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.020
Now, what we can do is we're going to need to look for this comment icon over here.

37
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.960
So whenever we click on this comment, it's going to take us to that screen.

38
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.920
Okay.

39
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.180
This is where we have the comments.

40
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.590
Okay.

41
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.470
Now, this inkwell has a property known as what's on tap.

42
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.430
Okay.

43
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.190
Right.

44
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.510
And now what we can do is we can say, now the guitar.

45
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.310
Of course, I'm just going to go to under the screen now.

46
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.720
Just stop the video from playing.

47
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.920
Okay.

48
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.240
Now you get a.

49
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.190
Lots of contest.

50
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.230
And we can then say dots.

51
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.430
Whoosh!

52
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.460
Okay.

53
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.780
Now for The Roots.

54
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.150
Is it not taking something on us?

55
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.170
Not severe.

56
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.050
Page.

57
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.120
Roots.

58
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.150
Okay.

59
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.090
Okay.

60
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.060
And for the view there it is going to take in context.

61
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.180
And as well, we can specify it is a type of viewed context, but we don't really need that.

62
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.130
Okay.

63
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.760
Most of the time we don't have to specify and most of the time you need to specify.

64
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.400
Okay.

65
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.210
Now, over here.

66
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.160
We then need this.

67
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.900
Okay.

68
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.980
Now find it and see what you're missing.

69
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.970
Okay.

70
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.370
This and over this again.

71
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.640
To see what you're missing, the key.

72
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.060
You can see we are missing one additional apprentices.

73
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.590
Okay.

74
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.920
Now over here.

75
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.940
What we can do is we can then say we can.

76
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.580
Commons screen so they made the user clicks on this comment icon is going to immediately take the user

77
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.480
to the comment screen where they're going to drop your comments.

78
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.920
Okay.

79
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.740
Or via satellite in this country.

80
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.120
And it's in that same part.

81
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.390
It's.

82
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.530
Okay.

83
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.820
Think what we can do is.

84
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.420
Get.

85
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:19.160
We do this again and try calling it to see who's going to automatically do it for us.

86
00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.490
Okay.

87
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.260
Comments.

88
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.079
Okay.

89
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.040
Great.

90
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.840
Okay.

91
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.510
Now, we can't use Katrina to save.

92
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.670
Contrariness.

93
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.500
And try this out.

94
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.740
Okay.

95
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.820
Back to this and click on this.

96
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.670
Okay.

97
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.870
You can see it took us to the comment screen.

98
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.160
Right.

99
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.690
Okay.

100
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.430
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
