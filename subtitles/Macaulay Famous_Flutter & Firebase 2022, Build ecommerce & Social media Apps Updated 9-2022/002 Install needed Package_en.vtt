Now, like I said.

53
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.440
Users are going to be able to click image from either the gallery or carrier.

54
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.770
So I saw a package for that and had to get that done.

55
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.960
So I'm going to go back to our browser.

56
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.530
We're going to go back to port there for now to go back to the old page.

57
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910
They're able to search for a package known as image picker.

58
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.450
Okay.

59
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.550
This you can see we have image because we have image picker here.

60
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.610
So I'm going to go with this image picker that as we tested this.

61
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.190
Okay.

62
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.830
So as well, we're going to talk to this.

63
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.690
Okay.

64
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:57.410
Is this okay now also or lastly, at least for the provider, which we're going to use as our state

65
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.160
management.

66
00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.690
Okay.

67
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.380
So we're going to click on this provider.

68
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.690
Okay.

69
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.460
And copy this.

70
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.080
Is this okay?

71
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.650
Now we can use control and s to save.

72
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.210
Then of their vacancies already get in the package way for any reason you can speak on this.

73
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.630
I think probably we have the issue.

74
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.090
If this.

75
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.120
Who's going to close this

76
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.160
place or I think we have its place.

77
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.300
Okay.

78
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.730
I'm sure that said.

79
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.680
We need to hide.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.210
Okay.

81
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.130
Okay.

Now, I'll never wait for this.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.630
Okay.

85
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.160
Probably done already.

86
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.060
Okay, great.

87
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.530
Now it is always needs for remember we just we just integrated base.

88
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.330
We also added all this package.

89
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.920
So it's very for for you to restart your vehicle.

90
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:28.250
So what we're going to do is I going close the vertical not to get all the changes they've made so far.

91
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.720
So a little closed this vertical then what you can do is to.

92
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.720
We start to click on it again.

93
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.140
Okay.
