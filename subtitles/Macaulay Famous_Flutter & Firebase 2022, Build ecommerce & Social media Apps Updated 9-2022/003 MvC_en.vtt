00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.640
Now, what I simply did was for the project on visa code, and this is the default float I created for

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.880
us.

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.330
Okay.

6
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.840
Now, one of the ways we're going to be using it to structure our files is known as MVC, which stands

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.660
for Models, Views, Controllers.

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.200
Now over the sleeve folder, I want to click on that.

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.430
Then I will click on new folder.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.120
Okay.

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.790
Now, the first four that are going to be created is M and we stands for the models.

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.690
Okay.

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.280
Now over is live as well.

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.640
Have a look.

15
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.570
Click on that then.

16
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.690
New folder that the next four that are going to create is the V and we stand forward to views.

17
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.800
Okay.

18
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.500
Then lastly, the folder that we created as the controllers, right click on new folder that is a C

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.350
and which stands for controllers.

20
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.060
Okay, Controllers.

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.480
Okay.

22
00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.020
Now.

23
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.950
This is what else views control us.

24
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.380
Okay.

25
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.330
Now the models for the Israel, we're going to be creating our fields such as the username field, the

26
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.810
password field, the email field and the image URL and so on.

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.300
Okay.

28
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.710
Then for the views, the views for the is we're going to be creating our UI such as the home screen

29
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.960
UI, the log in you are the sign off, you are the sign that you are the profile.

30
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.680
You are the search ui on so hard.

31
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.310
Okay.

32
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.980
Then for the controllers for the the controllers, for the it, we are going to be creating our functionality

33
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.450
such as functions.

34
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:50.080
So assign and user functions to assign arts user functions to create user interface for and so on.

35
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.890
Okay.

36
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.860
Now we've I said the views for the is you're going to be creating our users.

37
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.310
Okay.

38
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.790
Now for simplicity.

39
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.600
What we can also do over this view's footer, we can click on it, then we can go to New Footer, then

40
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.410
we can create it for the quad screens.

41
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.789
Okay.

42
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.400
Now, the first cruise ship that we have is the log in screen, then the register screen.

43
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.320
So for more businesses, what we can do is over the screens for the we can create another footer and

44
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.350
we can call this for the heart.

45
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.590
Okay.

46
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.520
And over the hot footer, I think I can barely click on that heart.

47
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.240
I just think I have to try.

48
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.390
Then I will create a new file if for any reason within creating the whole chicken as religious.

49
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.100
Just was it right?

50
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.480
Okay.

51
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.940
So I click on new file.

52
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.370
Okay.

53
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.900
Then they're going to create.

54
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.210
If I could log in on the score screen, then dot, dot.

55
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.100
Okay.

56
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.780
I think is nuts and the heart's fine.

57
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.760
What I can do, I can go to my face.

58
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.470
Then I can go to the.

59
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.340
I created it.

60
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.360
This is it.

61
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.460
Of ecommerce of.

62
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.770
There we can go to leave.

63
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.790
Right.

64
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.490
We can go to views screens.

65
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.450
Okay.

66
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.570
Heart attack is not in the heart.

67
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.630
So we can cut this off and go to the heart and it here.

68
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.590
Okay.

69
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.090
Good.

70
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.820
Okay.

71
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.680
There's a two way.

72
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.590
Now, what we can do over here, we're gonna use this fitness widget for this.

73
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.110
So this is Atlas, which is you can just see as to hell is going to predict for you.

74
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.950
Okay.

75
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.270
We can call this as well.

76
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.010
Log in screen.

77
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.490
Okay, then over here.

78
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.190
First of all, I want to highlight this.

79
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.100
Then I will use control and dots in order to import the material to that package.

80
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.670
Okay.

81
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.060
Now, you know, it's easy to get rid of this on the line.

82
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:15.170
What we can as well do is to screw down and go to the analysis options and we can as well just come

83
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.220
out to this house.

84
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.300
Okay.

85
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.829
Okay.

86
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.280
First of all, I'm with AIDS Control and ask to see if you can see saved.

87
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.180
Okay.

88
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.820
Then you're going to go to the login screen.

89
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.690
Okay.

90
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.540
That you can see is gone with us is not going for any reason.

91
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.370
You can still save this file or just after restart your code.

92
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.810
Okay.

93
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.290
Now, for now, what we can do is, is that if it's on in a container, we can return a scaffold now

94
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.800
for the style block of property scaffold.

95
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.280
Okay.

96
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.670
Now we're going to have a body for now that is going to be a centre widget.

97
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.580
So we centre whatever to the hardness.

98
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.000
Okay.

99
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.050
Centre.

100
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.930
So what you can have is a tide.

101
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.530
A tide and a chest.

102
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.930
Probably.

103
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.990
Log in.

104
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.990
Log in screen.

105
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.070
Okay.

106
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.060
Get rid of this.

107
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.640
Now you can get over it.

108
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.690
You can see we.

109
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.550
We need one more of this.

110
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.360
Okay?

111
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.760
Now we need control and has to save.

112
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.370
Okay.

113
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.830
Now we're going to go to the way the dots fight when they lose control and B, to make this wide.

114
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.060
Okay.

115
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.450
Now, instead of routes on this on page.

116
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.370
We can get rid of this over every ten.

117
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.240
The homepage then instead of this.

118
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.150
We can use.

119
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.590
Okay.

120
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.530
You can see the log in screen.

121
00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.840
Okay.

122
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.440
Good.

123
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.970
Now.

124
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.840
Go check it out.

125
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.150
Okay.

126
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.980
You can see it very.

127
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.790
Okay.

128
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.360
Good.

129
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.150
Now we can as well get rid of this foreigner.

130
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.030
So in order to do that.

131
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.150
Okay, we can.

132
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:25.500
Of the material of the can set the debug sure checks what we can set it to force.

133
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.700
Okay.

134
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.890
Good.

135
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.580
Check it out.

136
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.730
Okay.

137
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.900
Now you can see he's gone.

138
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.050
Now what you can do is to use a duct tape.

139
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.310
So to do this, I go to believe.

140
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.450
For the den.

141
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.880
We're going to create a new fire, probably.

142
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.730
We're going to call this fire caused thought.

143
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.200
Okay.

144
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.140
Now, what we can do is we can create a river called.

145
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.610
Background.

146
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.590
Hello.

147
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.340
Because that is a close thought.

148
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.900
BLOCK okay.

149
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:14.440
Now in order to serve as luck, we need to aim for this and will not like today's culture and dodge

150
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.660
Fords.

151
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.350
And what's your other.

152
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.110
That's okay.

153
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.180
Then of I add your semicolon.

154
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.820
Okay, great.

155
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.020
Now you're going to go back to the foreground, so.

156
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.160
Well, that's fine.

157
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.920
Then I want you to contribute to Invictus wide.

158
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.920
First of all, you can see we have this team data.

159
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.610
Okay, we're going to get rid of this same data.

160
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.300
First the governor.

161
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.550
Team data.

162
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.690
Stand or duck.

163
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.340
Okay, now, control to save and go check it out.

164
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.910
Okay.

165
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.290
Now you can see it is kind of dark, but it's not what we want.

166
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.260
So what you can do.

167
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.440
We can see that coffee.

168
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.210
With that is we want to use that collar, which we defined in the calls.

169
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.930
That's fine.

170
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.100
So what can we see?

171
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.290
We can see a scaffold.

172
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.020
We've got a colour, should be the background colour.

173
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.270
We should have the colour of black.

174
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.630
Right.

175
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.010
So this is going to give us a duck.

176
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.510
Now.

177
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.790
I just think I'm too old to start this.

178
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.610
Okay.

179
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.210
Great.

180
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.530
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
