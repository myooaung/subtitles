00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.460
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.630
Not currently users are being able to have the same products multiple times.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.760
Now what we can do is we can have a check to know if that product has already been added by that user

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.900
and if the product has already been headed by that user.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.880
We then want to send the user a message which is going to say, Hi, Tim already has this in cards.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.820
Okay, now to do this we have to go to the detail folder and then the product underscore detail screen

8
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.460
and we can use controller and B to make this wide.

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.030
Okay.

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.250
And you can see we have this button over the the.

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.640
Heart to cut button.

12
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.030
Right.

13
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.680
And over here we are going to call the provider.

14
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.720
Provider dir then dropped off condensed.

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.320
Contest and over yet we have to specify it is a type of cards provider.

16
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.560
And now we can say get, get it.

17
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.930
So now we are going to be using a property known as first, whether or not and in order to use this

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490
property, we first have to import it.

19
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.590
So we are going to screw up.

20
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:36.640
And over here we are going to import and it is found in collection slash collection dot dot and click

21
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.450
on this error to go back and we can then say first where or no.

22
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.150
And you can see these elements are same as value.

23
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.920
So instead of calling it elements, we can call house products and you can see this product has a variable

24
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.860
that stores this card provider class.

25
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.430
Okay.

26
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.660
Great.

27
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.930
And now we can have our check.

28
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.880
Get rid of this.

29
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.470
False.

30
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.710
We can then say.

31
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.259
Products.

32
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.420
We have products, products, dots, documents, ID.

33
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
Is equal to the product list.

34
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.040
Product, this product this.

35
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.380
Sorry.

36
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.450
Product.

37
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.470
Product list.

38
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.500
And within the products we have a field known as.

39
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.280
Product ID if it is equal, if it is not equal to null is not equal to.

40
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.620
Not equal to.

41
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.290
No.

42
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.790
It means.

43
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.010
It means we have already had a productive cut, right, because it is not empty.

44
00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.400
We are basically saying if it is not empty, right, then we want to return.

45
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.880
Maybe a snack bar.

46
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.180
Snack bar?

47
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.900
Snack bar.

48
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.870
Snack bar.

49
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.790
Okay.

50
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.770
And the title is going to say item already in cos.

51
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.700
And else.

52
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.040
If we have not had it, then we want to be able to have that.

53
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.160
And this is basically it.

54
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.590
And lastly, we have to set listen to force.

55
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.280
You're going to see why we are doing this in the future.

56
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.990
So do not worry.

57
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.580
Okay.

58
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:45.610
Now what we're basically saying, if the products if the cards document ID is or maybe we can just call

59
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.110
this cards to make it more clear cut.

60
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.940
Get rid of this and cut.

61
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.730
Okay.

62
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.250
And you can see why it's in the cards.

63
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.350
We have a field known as document ID, right?

64
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.270
So we are basically checking if it is equal.

65
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.460
And remember, this document ID is basically still referring to the product ID and we are basically

66
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.540
checking if.

67
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.090
Okay.

68
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:22.430
If the if the document ID or if the cards document ID because we have this value within the cards or

69
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.380
this or this field within the cards.

70
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.630
If the cards document ID is equal to the product list of product ID.

71
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.300
Then if it is not equal to no, it means we have something there.

72
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.080
Right.

73
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.760
It means there is a value because it is not equal to no.

74
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.200
Or what we are basically saying.

75
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.900
If it is not empty, then if it is not empty.

76
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.920
We want to return a snack bar, which is item already in cart because definitely we already have a valid

77
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.240
there and the document ID is equal to the product ID.

78
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.610
Right.

79
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.160
Okay.

80
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.940
Else if it is not we.

81
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.400
If it is not empty, we don't want to do this.

82
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.010
Okay.

83
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.020
So if it is empty, we then want to be able to hide.

84
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.430
But if it is not empty, it means is already there.

85
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.360
Think this is a bit confusing and hopefully you understand.

86
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.020
Okay, now we can try this out with maybe another products.

87
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.850
Hope we have this list into force.

88
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.420
Okay.

89
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.960
And then then this.

90
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.220
Okay.

91
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.180
Click on this.

92
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.940
And I think I already had that before.

93
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.660
Okay.

94
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.160
I'm going to add a new product maybe from the shoes.

95
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.940
Okay.

96
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.020
And.

97
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:56.210
And click on this now add to cart and currently we have in the cards already.

98
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.070
So we should not be able to hide it.

99
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.170
You can see we can screw.

100
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.620
Oh, man, I think I did.

101
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:12.100
I think this is what we can screw to see, that we are going to sort out that later and click on it

102
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.380
again.

103
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.830
You can see I am already in cuts.

104
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.140
Some school rights, some school.

105
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.720
Okay.

106
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.640
We can try for another.

107
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.380
Maybe this.

108
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.520
In art again.

109
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.470
Item already in cards.

110
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.370
Hope you understand.

111
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.290
But if you don't, you can do well to let me know.
