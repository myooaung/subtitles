00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.630
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.360
Now, in this lecture to start reading the functionality for our sign off page.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.960
Okay.

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.260
Now to do this, I wanna go to five Rosetta controllers for the is there going to be created the functionalities

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.490
for our have.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:28.140
So over this controllers for the to create a new FI and I'm going to call this fi or underscore controller.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.590
Thought that.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.680
Right.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.540
That is for the authentication.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.990
Okay.

12
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.750
Now, what we can do over here, going to create a class I going to call this, but.

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.170
Control as well.

14
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.610
Okay.

15
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.800
Now, what's he going to do next?

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.420
They're going to say a stance.

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.420
Get as.

18
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.820
Get his controller.

19
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.580
So by doing this, Geddes is going to have control over the UI.

20
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.269
Okay.

21
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.730
Great.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.980
I think we.

23
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440
Okay, great.

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.470
Now, before I go further, what I'm going to do, we are going to initialize Firebase like saying we

25
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.770
want to call Firebase or start of the Fab Bayes NJ before we start using our hub.

26
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.460
Okay, so we are going to go to the main dot dot fi.

27
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.270
Okay.

28
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.310
Now when is control B to make this slider?

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.510
Okay.

30
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.380
Now, over here, I'm going to make this async because you are going to be using the waits to wait for

31
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.100
firebase.

32
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.760
So now what I'm going to do first I want to say widget.

33
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.910
We get.

34
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.250
What are.

35
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.030
Binding dot is sure initialized.

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.290
Okay.

37
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.680
Now I will wait for the player base.

38
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.170
So now we are going to say I wait.

39
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.380
Firebase.

40
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.640
That's.

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.870
With.

42
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.040
Five these.

43
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.380
That is sure in the initialize.

44
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.940
Okay.

45
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.980
Now what you're going to see doing this, you're going to see a dot then.

46
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.180
Okay.

47
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.610
So you're going to say Todd then is going to use this London auction auditorium.

48
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.890
So now I'm going to get that.

49
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.130
Okay.

50
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.400
First of all, we're going to use control and not.

51
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:07.270
In part parties get scared or that we have access to all the get property so that once it gets pulled.

52
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.610
Okay.

53
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.300
Now we are going to pass that controller.

54
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.800
So by doing this, I will have access to that OTS controllers or controller class in all the routes.

55
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.450
Okay, great.

56
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.210
Not insisting that we are going to do is that all of this material is going to be.

57
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.060
Gets my Syria up gets.

58
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.880
I think.

59
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.180
Let's see.

60
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.060
Okay.

61
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.690
Good.

62
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.530
Okay.

63
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.640
Now our hearts.

64
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.010
We start this.

65
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.620
They're going to go to that summit.

66
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.450
I think they're going to see.

67
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.490
We just created that.

68
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.040
The bloke also.

69
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.440
Okay.

70
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.730
Okay.

71
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.560
I'm just going to wait for it to restart.

72
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.420
Okay, great.

73
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:23.350
You can see the odds control has been created out of control as we initialize get what's up as we've

74
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.640
created get what Syria has been initialized.

75
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.010
Okay great.

76
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.410
Now we can start working on the functionality for users.

77
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.750
Of the of our users are going to sign up.

78
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.110
Right.

79
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.210
Okay.

80
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.380
So over here.

81
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.360
So the regulars have created the functionality for our sign up page, sending this picture.

82
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.440
They're going to start that.

83
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.750
Okay, guys, see you in the next.
