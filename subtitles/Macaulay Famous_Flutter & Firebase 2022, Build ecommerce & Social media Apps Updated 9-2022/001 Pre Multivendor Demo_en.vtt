00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.350
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.610
Now, recently I got a review which says the ecommerce codes are way too zoomed and currently how making

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.690
a cost on multi-vendor hub with at partner hands a payment gateway.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.030
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to upload this lectures in this course.

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.350
And the reason for this is because you deserve better.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.310
But before then, please note I'm not yet done with the demo and it's going to take six days for me

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.740
to be true with the demo, which after I'm going to replace with this video.

9
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.570
Okay.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.000
But before then as well, I'm going to show you the parts which I'm done with.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.970
So this is the hub.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.760
Like I said, it is a multi-vendor hub and it's going to have a me partner and also a payment method.

13
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.750
Okay.

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.520
Now we basically have two type of user that is the customers and the sellers.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.050
Okay.

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.900
Now, this is a customer.

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.050
Screen we can.

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.100
The picture, perfect picture by either from camera or the gallery.

19
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.190
Okay.

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.160
We just have to wait for our.

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.970
Gallery.

22
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.380
Click on this.

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.320
Ed is asking for the full name.

24
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.670
For the full name.

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.900
This is going to be.

26
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.040
Mark.

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.110
Mark.

28
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.050
Peter and is asking for the email address.

29
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.400
And this is going to be Mark.

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.510
Peter.

31
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:52.680
At Gmail dot com and the password is going to be B, e, j y and a C, and we can as well hide our password.

32
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.910
Okay.

33
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.850
In order for us to create a seller's account, we can just click on create a seller's account or via

34
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.620
or we can just choose to log in.

35
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.240
What we have to do is now is to click on the sign up.

36
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.570
Okay.

37
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.300
This is going to take some time in order to sign up the user.

38
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.600
And like I said, I'm not yet done with the demo.

39
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.900
And it's going to take about six days for me to finish this, and I'm going to replace it with the new

40
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.270
video.

41
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.790
Okay.

42
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.280
So that's asking for us to sign in into the accounts we just recently created.

43
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.600
And for the email address, I think we called this mack.

44
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.930
Peter has email dot com and the password is going to be b.j y missy.

45
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.570
Right.

46
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.030
And we can then click on log in.

47
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.470
This is going to take some time as well to log in the user.

48
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.970
Okay, great.

49
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.420
Now you can see we have various categories.

50
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.530
That is the man categories, the women categories and the shoes categories.

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.440
We also okay, we don't currently have any products for the shoes categories and each sellers is going

52
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.790
to have its own store.

53
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:21.190
You can see currently we have just one seller and it has just one store which is called Mac Store.

54
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.520
Okay.

55
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.390
We're just going to wait for this to see how many products that seller has.

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.460
That seller has one, two, three, four, five, five products.

57
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.230
We can choose to contact the seller through WhatsApp and as well we can follow the seller via.

58
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.610
Okay.

59
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.430
And.

60
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.930
We can click on any of the products we desire to buy.

61
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.580
And this is the.

62
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.030
Product image.

63
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.660
We have up to two images for that product.

64
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.680
And we can click on this to view it fully.

65
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.790
You can see.

66
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.570
We can basically switch over to.

67
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.440
You can see.

68
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.060
And go back.

69
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.930
Then we can choose to hard to cut and we can go to the car screen.

70
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.870
You can see we can choose to increment our cards and we can choose to document.

71
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.190
And like I said, it's going to take these days to for me to finish the full demo and I'm going to replace

72
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.910
it with.

73
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.890
With this lecture.

74
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.700
So for now, I'm not yet done with the demo, but it's going to be a fully featured motivation to have

75
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.280
with all Multi-vendor futures.

76
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.810
You can see why.

77
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.970
We also do have the categories and this is the main categories.

78
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:51.730
We also do have for the women shoes, bags and many others and jackets.

79
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.510
Okay.

80
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.880
Order a profile.

81
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.120
This is the profile of the of the user.

82
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.510
You can see Mac Pizza and the email address is Mac Pizza, the phone number.

83
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.800
Okay.

84
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.960
We can as well log out, change password for to and so on.

85
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.090
Okay.

86
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.890
This is the screen.

87
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.330
Okay.

88
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.090
Now, this is basically what I've what I've done so far, and I'm going to start uploading the lectures

89
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.260
for all this.

90
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.760
There's going to take me six days.

91
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.410
You can see we can as well.

92
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.730
Hard to figure, right?

93
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.580
It's going to take me up to six days.

94
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.300
Then I'm going to replace after I'm done with the Motivator Hub, I'm going to replace it with this

95
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.960
lecture.

96
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.130
So you are fully going to see what we are going to learn or not to build.

97
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.780
So you can see it basically has all the ecommerce features and.

98
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.790
It's going to have more of the E future.

99
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.970
So this is a very good composition, but I'm still going to leave that E Commerce section there.

100
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.010
But I think it's way too zoomed, according to some students.

101
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.050
I think everyone deserves to be satisfied.

102
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.130
So you can watch that section.

103
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.690
That is the E Commerce section, because I'm going to leave that there, but I'm going to have a new

104
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.480
section where you're going to learn a lot to build a fully featured Multi-window hub.

105
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:31.340
So this is the customize account you can see has the profile via and this is the store of the the seller.

106
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.810
That's all you want.

107
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.690
You just need to do is you're going to need to wait for six days.

108
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.510
So I'm going to make I'm going to complete the multi vendor hub.

109
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.360
Then you're going to see what you you're going to know how to build after the course.

110
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.810
Okay.

111
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.630
So basically throughout this course, throughout the entire course, you're going to learn how to build

112
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.870
a to clone and e-commerce websites.

113
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.780
Is Zoom cloned and a multi-vendor clone.

114
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.680
So this is the course of dates currently.

115
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.590
Okay.

116
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.760
And like I said, and since this time, I'm going to be done with the demo and I'm going to replace

117
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.090
it with this lecture for you to see.

118
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.830
Okay.

119
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:25.120
For you to see what you learned on attribute after you finish the after you finish the what vendor section.

120
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.780
Okay.

121
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.950
You can see we can create a seller's account.

122
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.560
Create a seller's account.

123
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.910
Click on.

124
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.550
Okay.

125
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.640
Hopefully I can create a seller's account.

126
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.020
And we can.

127
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.320
Upload this image.

128
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.750
And for the full name, it is basically referring to the store name.

129
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.280
So I'm going to call this Mac Pizza Store.

130
00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:03.930
And for the middle class, this Mack Peter store had Gmail.

131
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.440
That's com.

132
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.730
And the password is going to be g-a-y and ac.

133
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.260
And.

134
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:18.720
We're going to need to click on the sign up and it's going to take some time to create the user and

135
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.030
then after we are going to be able to log into the accounts.

136
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.510
Okay.

137
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.430
We just have to wait for this.

138
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.150
I think it's taking longer than expected.

139
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.159
Probably my network issue.

140
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.370
Okay.

141
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.710
And now we can.

142
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:37.700
Mark.

143
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.049
Peter.

144
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.110
Store art.

145
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.900
Gmail dot com.

146
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.690
And the password is this.

147
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.850
And we just have to click on log in.

148
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.180
Log in.

149
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.130
Okay.

150
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.310
You can see we also have the men category, the women category.

151
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:05.470
But this time around we have the dashboard and you can see the user is going to have the story.

152
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.940
The seller is going to have my store.

153
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.270
You can see this is this is the seller store.

154
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.210
Okay.

155
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.750
I'm just going to solve this later, okay?

156
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.850
Like I said, this is currently under development and I'm going to be done with this in six days.

157
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:21.320
Okay.

158
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.360
My store.

159
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.960
Okay.

160
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.680
We have not uploaded any products yet.

161
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.980
Right.

162
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:35.520
So yeah, we can upload products to various categories.

163
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:42.160
We can see we can upload to the main category and we can choose from the subcategory of the man.

164
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:49.840
We have the shirt, the t shirt, jacket, best coats, jeans, shots, suits and order.

165
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.270
Like we can have the price and we can add multiple images.

166
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.730
You can choose to upload multiple images.

167
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.270
Okay for dinner?

168
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.500
I just have one, but we can upload multiple images.

169
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.740
We can upload multiple images and we're going to be able to slide this way in order to see the images

170
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.020
we upload that we can choose the price, the quantity, the product name.

171
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.040
The description.

172
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.940
You can see.

173
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.940
But we also do have this tour.

174
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.920
You can see we have two stores.

175
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.250
Okay.

176
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:32.320
The Mac store and Mac Beta Store, which I just recently created and currently this user do not have

177
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.790
any products.

178
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.440
Right.

179
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.450
Okay.

180
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.000
But this user has some products.

181
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.680
Okay.

182
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.470
You can see.

183
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.350
Okay.

184
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.780
Okay.

185
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.540
You can see we can add to favorites.

186
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.240
Civil Rights Act.

187
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.450
You can see we can.

188
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:57.820
That's great, right?

189
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.400
Okay.

190
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:07.030
Now, in six days, I'm going to show you the full demo because after a customer purchases any products

191
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.180
the seller is going to have an end is for.

192
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.940
That's okay.

193
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.790
You're going to see you can see the balance.

194
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.480
So you can see the statistics, the manage product, edit profile.

195
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.910
So our Multi-vendor hub is basically going to have all these features U.S. via OC.

196
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.220
So in six days I'm going to be done with the demo and you're going to see what you're going to know

197
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.760
how to view it.

198
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.330
But before then, I'm going to start uploading lectures for all this right away, okay?

199
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.050
Okay, guys, see you in the next video.
