00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.100
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:01.589
Walker.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.040
In this lecture, we are going to display the preparing products.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:16.200
Okay, now, to do this, first of all, what we can do is we can go to the customer or the screen where

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.230
we already have similar functionality.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.760
So what we can just do is we can light everything and use control and see to copy and back to the seller

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.470
order.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.980
Sorry, back to the preparing screen.

9
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.870
We can then light everything and get rid of this and then we can paste and first of all we can get rid

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.010
of this unused import and then we can allow it.

11
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.890
Similar.

12
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.230
And then we can.

13
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.230
We name this back to preparing screen.

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.730
OC Contra and B both.

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.380
This time around we are going to retrieve orders where the delivery.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.220
Remember, within the fields we have a field known as delivery status.

17
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.880
We are going to retrieve orders based on where the delivery set is is equal to.

18
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:34.000
Is a choir to create pair in this country and save.

19
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.000
And just preparing products are then going to be displayed over here.

20
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.150
Okay.

21
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.350
Sounds good.

22
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.390
I think we are still having this about.

23
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.040
We can just get rid of that.

24
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.270
Look where we have that upper.

25
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.110
Okay.

26
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.730
We could alight and is concerned that we can remove this.

27
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010
That way we can just.

28
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.860
Get rid of this harbor.

29
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.550
Get rid of.

30
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.390
It.

31
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.460
OC is country and has to save.

32
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.800
And we could also get rid of this unused import.

33
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.070
And check this out.

34
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.040
Okay.

35
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.890
I think this is okay.

36
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.510
And currently we have the preparing products.

37
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.040
And when the product is sent for shipping is then going to be displayed over here.

38
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.240
And when the product has been finally shipped, it's going to be it's going to be marked as delivered

39
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.470
and it's then going to be displayed over by Cisco.

40
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.630
Okay.

41
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.480
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
