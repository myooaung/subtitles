00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.830
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.330
Now that we have successfully addressed the others in this lecture, we're going to display the others.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.510
But before then, I think we have to rename this.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.460
We're going to rename this to others.

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.180
And is it a fetch product?

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.930
You're going to call this fetch others.

8
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.330
Okay.

9
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.750
And over here we can as work or add this quantity to a string by saying dots to string.

10
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.140
Okay.

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.870
Now, over here, you can see we have the product idea field.

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.410
But in our database, we don't have any field as such.

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.900
So definitely we're going to get a batch error.

14
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980
So what we can do is for now, we can get rid of this.

15
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
And definitely we're going to have an error because we made that field required.

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.770
So let go of this error.

17
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.400
What we can then do is to go to the card's attribute file, which we have in the models directory.

18
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.790
Okay.

19
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.420
So over here we can add the question mark to say it can be no.

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.600
Okay.

21
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.350
Then over here we can get rid of this required.

22
00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.700
Okay.

23
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.190
You can see we don't longer have that here.

24
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.470
Okay, great.

25
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.280
Now, I think over here we also need to save.

26
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.880
Okay.

27
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.220
Folder and it's control.

28
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.370
And that's to say.

29
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.730
Okay.

30
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.300
Now, the next step is to make sure we tell our entire screen.

31
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.920
About this provider file we just created.

32
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.210
Okay.

33
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.410
So to do that, we didn't need to go to the main did that file, right.

34
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.720
I think you've seen this before.

35
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.990
Okay.

36
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.390
And in that fight and what we can then do is we can just copy this and test then.

37
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.190
Is it a parts provider?

38
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.190
This is going to be order.

39
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.710
I think we call this others.

40
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.340
Okay, great.

41
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.780
Okay.

42
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.200
Not to display a hardass, you're going to need to go back to the order screen.

43
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.340
Okay.

44
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.230
And over here we can dance a finer and.

45
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.720
We can create a prepaid card or the provider.

46
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.610
And they're going to seize the courts to provide the rights.

47
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.850
Again, we can click on this and then dozens of contest and over here.

48
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.960
You're going to pass in that order.

49
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.710
Or just provide a class.

50
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.120
Okay.

51
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.120
Now, instead of this, all we can then say is other provider start.

52
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.440
Gets orders, then the length.

53
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.850
Okay.

54
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.410
Now, if you forget the orders, get other stores.

55
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.560
You can just go back to the lecture where we went, where we did this.

56
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.930
Okay.

57
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.580
Now let's check it out.

58
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.040
Okay.

59
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.690
Okay.

60
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.860
My orders.

61
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.680
Okay.

62
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.860
You can see not saying all we can do is we can hardly start this.

63
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.300
Okay.

64
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.380
Let's just start in.

65
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.120
But we start in.

66
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.600
Okay.

67
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.080
Okay.

68
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.510
Okay.

69
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.920
Okay.

70
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.380
Okay.

71
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.540
Okay.

72
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.850
Now click on.

73
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.520
So.

74
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.480
I think my orders like nuts and also gets displayed.

75
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.300
So all we can do is you're going need to call that fetch product, right?

76
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.570
Okay.

77
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.090
So let's see if we can call this in the home.

78
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.060
And your home screen.

79
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.480
Okay.

80
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.180
So what we can do is we can say finer and.

81
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.790
Or the provider.

82
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.140
So fetch all that.

83
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.010
That's what I want to call.

84
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.370
Right?

85
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.440
Or that provider, it's going to be equal to provider.

86
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.690
That contest.

87
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.630
Right.

88
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.510
And over here.

89
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.680
You can then say.

90
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.570
Others.

91
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.310
Rights others.

92
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.520
Then you can see all the.

93
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.280
Provider.

94
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.230
Those words, fetch others.

95
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.620
Okay.

96
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.750
Now, let's also studies to see.

97
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.350
To see if it's working, and that's okay.

98
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.870
Ack ack ack ack ack ack ack ack.

99
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.470
And.

100
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.170
And.

101
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.800
And.

102
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.610
And.

103
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.560
Okay, great.

104
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.720
So we needed to call this we needed to call the fetch for that.

105
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.180
Right now, instead of calling, it's here.

106
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.750
I'm going to -- on a -- it so you can use this way or we're just going to do that and left in this

107
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.670
lecture or in the future lecture.

108
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.540
Now to save time.

109
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.660
I think this is the process we have used so far.

110
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.950
So you should be able to understand, I think we've done this before for the fish for that.

111
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.280
Right.

112
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.600
Okay.

113
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.090
So what we can then do is to display our holders.

114
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.420
Okay.

115
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.020
Now to do that, you're going to need to go back to the order of the screen.

116
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.060
Okay.

117
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.760
This is the.

118
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.240
Okay.

119
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.480
Or the screen.

120
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.440
Okay.

121
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.760
And.

122
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.900
Okay, okay.

123
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.640
First of all, let's go to the order.

124
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.190
I think we're going to get an error.

125
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.220
Okay.

126
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.800
So over here, you're gonna need to import that court's order attribute, right?

127
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.450
I think you've seen this before, so.

128
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.010
So what we can say is, finally, we can just call this order list, and there's going to be a call

129
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.210
to provider.

130
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.760
And lots of contests.

131
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.530
And over here we're going to call that quarter, actually.

132
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.070
But okay, now.

133
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.170
So let's switch control.

134
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.850
Nice to see.

135
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.690
So and we're definitely going to have it here.

136
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.440
Okay.

137
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.240
You can see because we need to wrap this order item with something on us.

138
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.130
Change the notifier value.

139
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.120
Okay.

140
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.170
So we're going to go back to the order screen and over here, content dots wrap with widgets like change

141
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.580
notifier that value right.

142
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:20.460
You've seen this before and over here there's going to be value and order provider then just gets orders

143
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.690
then intense.

144
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.250
I think you've seen this before.

145
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.560
Like in our art, we start this or Katrina saved is going to go off now.

146
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.980
Okay.

147
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:37.230
Now you're going to now need to display our orders order item and contra and be.

148
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.850
Now there's nothing out there.

149
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.210
And I'm not going to going to be asset's image, but it's going to be network image, right?

150
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.390
Because it is coming from the database right over here.

151
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.220
You can see this is a network issue to be.

152
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.050
So what we can do is we need to convert this to network.

153
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.490
Network image.

154
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.110
And instead of just because I need to get rid of this, then we're going to see on the score, I think

155
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.740
we call this.

156
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.400
Okay.

157
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.320
We just called it on the order list.

158
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.800
Okay.

159
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.860
DOD imagery over a hell of a year.

160
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.690
This.

161
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.360
We're going to get rid of this and there's going to be order.

162
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.870
This.

163
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.050
Those words.

164
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.560
I think tied to that is the name of the product.

165
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.210
And over here we can then get rid of this order.

166
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.130
Order list.

167
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.620
Order lists.

168
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.710
The word prize.

169
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.230
Okay.

170
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.950
We already covered it.

171
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.570
Covered that.

172
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.670
It's a string, so you can see we don't need to convert.

173
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.960
Okay.

174
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.710
Sorry.

175
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.710
Not really.

176
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.180
There.

177
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.540
Okay.

178
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.190
Okay.

179
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.540
Other.

180
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.850
Or at least that's what the price.

181
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.320
Okay.

182
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.420
And I think that was a case country in excessive.

183
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.040
Okay.

184
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.680
You can see.

185
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.020
Okay.

186
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.150
You can see we have it multiple times.

187
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.530
We ordered it multiple times.

188
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.710
And that's why we are saying it multiple times.

189
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.140
Okay.

190
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.630
Okay.

191
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.560
Sounds good, right?

192
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.550
Okay.

193
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.810
If you have an issue, please let me know.

194
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:23.280
Okay?

195
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.450
Okay, guys.

196
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.830
See you in a sec.
