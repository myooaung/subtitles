00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.680
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.780
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.240
In this lecture, we are going to be able to add products to our wish list from.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.110
Yeah, okay.

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.410
Not to do this, we have to go to the detail dietary and then the products on the score detail.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.320
Fi and the reason for this is because we have already created the functionality.

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.830
Okay?

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.369
So what we can just do is you can see we have this icon button so we can alight.

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.510
To this OC use controller and see to copy.

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.030
And now we have to go to the design for each product and I think we have that in the widget.

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.700
There are three widgets and then products on the score model five.

12
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.330
Okay.

13
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.190
And now we have the high corn button of Iowa, which you're saying over here.

14
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.760
Right.

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.330
Okay.

16
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.700
So we can get rid.

17
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.250
Of this and we are then going to paste this.

18
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.950
And you can see currently we have this error.

19
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.880
This error, and it's can't be found.

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.960
Okay.

21
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
And we are going to be using this product right instead of the product list.

22
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.780
If you don't know what this is, again, you can just go back to that lecture where we did this, because

23
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.620
definitely you must have forgotten this.

24
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.010
But as a programmer, you can't become a full programmer doing something just once.

25
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.960
It is consistency.

26
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.690
Most of the time you have to repeat this up to 5 to 10 times in order for the codes to get used to you

27
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.710
or for you to be able to memorize all this.

28
00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.010
Okay, so feel free to go back to that lecture in case you have forgotten what this is.

29
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.870
Okay, back to this.

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.789
And we are going to get rid of this product list and it sees the poor.

31
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.560
Per.

32
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.770
That's okay.

33
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.930
Sorry.

34
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.720
Products.

35
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.310
Okay.

36
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.800
And also, we have to import this a light and use control.

37
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.430
For some reason, it's taking some time.

38
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.990
Okay.

39
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.080
And this.

40
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.080
And we also do have to import which lists provide provider class.

41
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.380
Okay.

42
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.100
And you can see we also do need to import this, but unfortunately we can't ski to that, so we have

43
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.570
to import it manually.

44
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.670
Okay.

45
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.180
All right.

46
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.440
This is going to be important and very important from the collection.

47
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.340
Slash collection.

48
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.040
Then the death.

49
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.950
I think it is not being used.

50
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.440
We're just going to do this again.

51
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.500
And wait for the prediction.

52
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.660
And plus.

53
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.510
Collection.

54
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.480
Collection of this large collection that it has been used now.

55
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.100
Okay.

56
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.470
Great.

57
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.550
And we have to change this to product list.

58
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.870
Product list, sorry, products.

59
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.710
And this is going to be products.

60
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.530
And you can just copy this and paste this over via.

61
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.820
Has this ever.

62
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.650
Because this.

63
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.480
Is this?

64
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.070
Tis this and tis this.

65
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.180
We have no heroes currently.

66
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:51.650
And finally, when a user clicks on this and if it is the if it has been added, we want to update this

67
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.940
icon to the full civil rights icon.

68
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.550
Right.

69
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.480
And in order to update the UI, we have to use what a stateful widget.

70
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.540
So we have to convert this list widgets.

71
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.130
Stateful widgets.

72
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.420
So to do this, I light and use control dots converts to stateful widget.

73
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.769
And since we just recently converted each state widget, it is most of the time required we hold.

74
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.310
We start and hopefully understand and if you don't this number.

75
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.270
You just have to go back to the previous lecture to master it, master the codes, and be able to do

76
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.250
it yourself.

77
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.350
Yeah.

78
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.710
Let's go check this out.

79
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.550
Okay.

80
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.060
Make sure you are logging into the customer account.

81
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.490
And I think I have an account associated to email.

82
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:58.460
So at me email dot com and the password is BGR Embassy and log in.

83
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.720
Okay.

84
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.630
Okay.

85
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.490
You just gonna wait for it to display the product's images first?

86
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.940
Okay.

87
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.840
Click on this.

88
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.850
Okay.

89
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.570
I did.

90
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.480
Click on this.

91
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.880
Okay.

92
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.560
Some skill.

93
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.080
And we have currently had that this week on this week on this.

94
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.540
Click on this and go to profile.

95
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.420
Okay.

96
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.050
Click on.

97
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.400
Which this.

98
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.980
You can see some school.

99
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.690
Sims writes.

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.020
And if you don't if you don't understand anything, please note fully available to support you do all

101
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.070
to let me know if you have any doubts.

102
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.780
And lastly, you can see there's an icon over there, but there is a back horror icon, but we can't

103
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.750
see it since the scaffold, the services they have has a colour of of white.

104
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.370
So what we can do is we can change that colour.

105
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.460
To do that we have to go to the wish list screen.

106
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.840
With this screen and within the harbor.

107
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.090
It has a property known as icon, chain and icon.

108
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.440
Same.

109
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.590
I think you've seen this before.

110
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.180
I can't.

111
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.900
Same data, then.

112
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.840
Sorry, I can't.

113
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.210
Data.

114
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.440
Then it has a property known as color.

115
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.880
And we're just going to say colors that black is concerned as save.

116
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.660
And you're going to see that however we're.

117
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.880
Okay.

118
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.060
And I think this is way too dark.

119
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.160
Okay.

120
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.040
I can just be black.

121
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.570
Okay.

122
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.450
Maybe get rid of.

123
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.620
Get rid of this font.

124
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.250
Okay.

125
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.450
Okay.

126
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.740
And maybe font.

127
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.980
So with.

128
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.990
The boat.

129
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.130
Okay.

130
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.020
And we can also get rid of this on used and part.

131
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.390
Look, you can try and save.

132
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.100
Okay.

133
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.080
Cisco.

134
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.180
Maybe we could change the color.

135
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.040
Which is to say.

136
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.460
We can just go with this or you can maybe have another color.

137
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.740
Okay.

138
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.530
We call this God's little head.

139
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.660
And you can go back and it's working as expected.

140
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.860
Okay, guys.

141
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.150
See?
