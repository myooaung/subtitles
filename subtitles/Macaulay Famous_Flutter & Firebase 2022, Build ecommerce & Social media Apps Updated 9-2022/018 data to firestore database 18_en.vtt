00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.650
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.009
Nine.

4
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.740
In last lecture we created is full fields.

5
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.470
That is the name you provide for to the email and the UID.

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.980
Now, for us to be able to use this for field, we have to pass it on to the constructor.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.850
Okay.

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.560
Now, over here.

9
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.330
What we simply did was to convert those four fields to a map.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.090
Okay, then over here we created instructions of all the user is going to create an account.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.930
Okay.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.100
Now, in this lecture, I signed this for Fields.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.790
Okay.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.420
To do this, I'm going to go to our ODS controller.

15
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.800
First of all, I'm going to control vitamin SWIDER.

16
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.920
Okay.

17
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.500
Now we're going to call that user model.

18
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.630
So good to see you.

19
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.920
It's a record.

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.940
It's user.

21
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.300
Okay.

22
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.610
This is going to go for this over here.

23
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.500
Okay.

24
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.220
I can see how this feels recreated.

25
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.690
But what I want to do first over here.

26
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.250
They're going to see this model.

27
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.690
And the reason for this is we also have a user which is coming from the heart.

28
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.880
So that's our heroes.

29
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.200
Okay.

30
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.430
So this should be.

31
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.610
Model standards user.

32
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.510
Right.

33
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.920
Okay.

34
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.810
Now what you're going to do because stored this new variable called our study results in a very well

35
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.040
called user equates to there's going to be a type of.

36
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.160
Model.

37
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.980
That is a great.

38
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.160
So for the name recognizer, it's to the user name.

39
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.040
Okay.

40
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.210
So for the name we're going to see.

41
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.260
Username.

42
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.110
Okay.

43
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.870
So user name.

44
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.090
Okay.

45
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.400
For the profile, the photo is going to be the download the URL.

46
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.010
Download.

47
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.900
You are real.

48
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.500
Okay, Duchess, after uploading the image, remember we did this in order to retrieve the image.

49
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.140
Okay.

50
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.700
Great.

51
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.430
Now for the new ID, this is going to be.

52
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.180
That is the Cavendish discovery.

53
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.360
It's going to be Creed.

54
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.170
Then.

55
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.150
DART user standards.

56
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.930
You Heidi, as well.

57
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.450
You can toss the ask permission to see it's kind of be now.

58
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.550
Okay, great.

59
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.950
Now, finally, we are going to upload the data.

60
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.570
So to do that, first of all, we are going to create a user.

61
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.520
I'm going to create a user coalition or like a future where our users is going to be stored.

62
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.530
So to do that, what you're going to do over.

63
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.770
Yeah.

64
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.220
Right.

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.970
Okay.

66
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.910
We are going to see a firestorm.

67
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.640
The vote credit available, which is only owed in the first five years faster.

68
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.140
So this is gonna be faster.

69
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.250
Dot coalition.

70
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.270
You're going to call this coalition users.

71
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.020
Okay.

72
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.390
So the users coalition.

73
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.420
You can see this as if for.

74
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.670
Okay.

75
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.140
That is going to talk.

76
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.270
We are going to connect the user with the users coalition.

77
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.860
So this is going to be.

78
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.660
Creed as a dirt user.

79
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.740
The dirt.

80
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.470
You did.

81
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.670
As well.

82
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.420
Okay.

83
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.579
Now I know that's a hard others fields or we just have to do is.

84
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.649
Dot set.

85
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.490
Okay.

86
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.250
The revenue comes in.

87
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.800
This user user is a variable audit of this fields.

88
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.610
Okay.

89
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.020
So I'm going to say user dot.

90
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.380
To.

91
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.500
Jason.

92
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.630
Okay.

93
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.270
Let's see.

94
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.720
We have to remove this.

95
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.470
Okay.

96
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.520
Great.

97
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.180
So this is basically it's right.

98
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.350
So this basically it's.

99
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.390
We can as well with this.

100
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.820
Okay.

101
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.600
Great.

102
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.600
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
