00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.900
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.220
You're welcome to the final lecture of the Zoom Clone application.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.470
Now, instead of using the popular Zoom application, you can use this created by you as it is as basically

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.810
all digital futures.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.330
Okay.

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.180
Now, in this lecture, I want to teach you how you're going to be able to share this app with your

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.110
friends, loved ones and everybody on the Internet.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.830
Okay.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.660
Now, to set it up, you're going to need to generate an epic for this.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.970
And to do that, you're going to need to go to your seminar, then youth seminar, then over a year.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.850
You're going to need to run flutter, dude, epic dash bash release.

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.160
Okay, this is going to take some time.

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.100
Then after you're going to see this builds, then you're going to see the location on how to show the

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.050
epic legacy correctly.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:08.760
It is 132 and be as size in the future videos or future costs.

16
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.510
I'm going to teach you how to size this well for now.

17
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.980
If you want to share this app with your friends and loved ones, make sure they have more than this

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.470
face.

19
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.950
Okay.

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.720
Now to the other use in this command.

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.040
That is the plot to build epic dash.

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.850
That's release.

23
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.670
You're going to need to go to this project that is the zoo clone.

24
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.760
Okay, so now a little good surprise.

25
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.530
I later moved it to.

26
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.460
All right.

27
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.950
I think yours is going to be stick stuck.

28
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.500
Okay, then.

29
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.060
Zocalo.

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.230
Then you can see.

31
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.260
It wants us to go to boot camp.

32
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.160
Hats, boots.

33
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.080
Okay.

34
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.530
Bude.

35
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.910
Harp.

36
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.780
Then hotspots then.

37
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.960
It wants us to go to water.

38
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.009
That's epic.

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.350
Okay.

40
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.420
Floater.

41
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.250
That's epic.

42
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.050
Then the name of the fi.

43
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.820
Is.

44
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.920
App dash release.

45
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.780
Abdus released.

46
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.800
IFTIKHAR Right.

47
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.220
Okay.

48
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.690
So now you're going to need to copy this abductor release.

49
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.260
DASH If okay.

50
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.650
Then you're just going to plug your the USB.

51
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.290
Okay.

52
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.740
Even the need to plug your USB.

53
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.120
Your Android writes.

54
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.590
Okay.

55
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.190
Then you're going to need to connect this with your Android device.

56
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.750
Look, I'm going to go to five, transfer my phone.

57
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.000
Okay.

58
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.850
You can see my phone is all right now.

59
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.090
You can go to this and place this.

60
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.480
Now, is this because it don't have such user space, right?

61
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.640
Well, you can just try to do this so stuff and paste that so you can then share with your friends and

62
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.300
loved ones.

63
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.320
So instead of using the Zoom application, you can use yours.

64
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.940
You can use this created by you with all so futures.

65
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.900
You can chat.

66
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.160
You can wave.

67
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.650
You can do basically everything you can do with Zoom.

68
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.210
And as it is this device, you can easily just share this with your loved ones.

69
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.800
So instead of using Zoom for you in this meeting, you can use this app, right?

70
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.280
Okay.

71
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.380
Okay, guys, that is all about a Zoom application.

72
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.330
In the section, we are going to start building an e-commerce application.

73
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.690
Okay, guys, see you in that section.
