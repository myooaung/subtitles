00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.630
Our guys work hard in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.820
We're going to start due to the common screen.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.330
Okay.

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.350
Now, what we can do is we can get rid of this.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.170
It's our widget.

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.350
But before then, over here we can add the the comma and then use control to in.

7
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.570
And that's in the way this entire widget ends.

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.020
Okay, so now we can then get rid of it.

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.160
Okay.

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.210
Now the first widget we're going to be using is a widget known as Single Child Scroll view that the

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.340
reason for this widget is because we want to be able to scroll this page.

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.780
Okay.

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.380
Single child scrub you.

14
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.270
Okay.

15
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.760
And the single task review has a property known as child.

16
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.930
The first child is going to be a size box, which is also similar, like that of the container.

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.950
Okay.

18
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.690
Now, what we can do is we can get the height and the width of our screen.

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.330
So to do that, we're going to need to see height.

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.000
And then that's again, the height of our screen.

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.550
We have the same media query that's of contest the size.

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.290
Dogs hides and as well we can get to eat off our screen by saying media.

23
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.100
Media query the lots of contest the size thoughts.

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.670
Weitz So by doing this, you're going to get the full height of our screen and the full width of our

25
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.180
screen.

26
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.930
Okay.

27
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.280
And now we can then use a child.

28
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.280
And the child is going to be a column widgets because we want all our widgets to be displayed.

29
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.980
Vertically.

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.280
That is from top to bottom.

31
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.950
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets, see it as this student property.

32
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.150
Okay.

33
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.960
Now, the first chart is going to be an expanded widget.

34
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.430
In order for the next widget, we're going to be using to take the available space.

35
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.400
Okay.

36
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.400
Okay.

37
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.050
Now, we're not just going to be having just one comment.

38
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.960
We're going to be having multiple comments.

39
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.470
So let's do this.

40
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.260
We're going to use something which is going to be similar to that of the following.

41
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.670
Not to do that.

42
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.660
We have a property in Florida known as Leased The View.

43
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.980
This view, the view there.

44
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.640
Okay.

45
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.280
The view the sick and something known as contest and as well you can specify it is a type of it contests

46
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.310
but most of the time you don't need to and as well it takes in the intense and as well you can specify

47
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.210
it is a type of ends and most of the time you don't also need to specify, okay, over here you can

48
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.050
then had this.

49
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.620
Okay, and now we can return something known as least sti.

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.580
Least stye.

51
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.350
Okay.

52
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.830
And over here, we can have a semicolon.

53
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.820
Okay.

54
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.960
Now, the list has the property known as leading.

55
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.000
The list is going to be at the left side, and for deleted is going to be a circle avatar.

56
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.540
That is the user profile.

57
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.790
User profile image.

58
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.780
And.

59
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.850
The Sequoia Avatars, a property known as background color.

60
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.320
And for the broken color.

61
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.810
For now, we can see colours, dots.

62
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.630
Gray.

63
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.530
Okay.

64
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.110
The shade theory under it.

65
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.750
Okay.

66
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:48.000
And as you know, it has the background image and this fits in network image for the now we can just

67
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.120
see a.

68
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.670
Profi.

69
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.960
For the.

70
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.160
Okay.

71
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.700
Now just Google.

72
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.790
Cross your apps and make sure you go to this and make sure you get you have all this all checked.

73
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.690
Okay.

74
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.400
So now all we can do is add the true value.

75
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.420
So let us know where it ends and where it starts.

76
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.380
Okay.

77
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.550
And use control.

78
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.360
And this is safe.

79
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.820
Okay.

80
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.519
Okay.

81
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.400
Now the list Thai has.

82
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.530
We has the property.

83
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.740
Now we need to come out from this leading right here.

84
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.080
Okay.

85
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.670
It also has a property known as theta, which is going to be at the middle.

86
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.720
Okay.

87
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.900
What we can do is, again, we can just check this out for us, like you can see.

88
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.710
Okay.

89
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.790
And.

90
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.680
There's going to be a test.

91
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.000
Okay.

92
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.900
What we can do is we can use zero widgets based on this, where you're going to see always in a row

93
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.350
widgets.

94
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.580
Okay.

95
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.580
The widget can take multiple kids.

96
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.320
So it's asked these children.

97
00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.960
Okay.

98
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.180
Attitude coma is comprehensive.

99
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.670
The first child is going to be a test widget and is going to be for the user name.

100
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.620
We can say this.

101
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.750
You can see test.

102
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.490
Chess tie.

103
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.520
And you can see font size to.

104
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.130
It's in.

105
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.460
Okay.

106
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.260
Youth culture to save and check it out.

107
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.230
Okay.

108
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.430
Okay.

109
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.970
You can see.

110
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.070
Okay, great.

111
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.330
And as well what we can do within the RO gets NCA.

112
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.670
You can.

113
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.480
Then how did you come in have another test which is which is going to be for the comments.

114
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.560
Okay.

115
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.090
Okay.

116
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.350
You can try this to save.

117
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.160
Here you're going to see over a year because this is a.

118
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.770
Okay.

119
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.760
What we can do is use this icebox.

120
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.960
Yes.

121
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.620
Icebergs.

122
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.800
And we can't see which we are given the space vertically.

123
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.970
Right.

124
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.870
This is going to be.

125
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.480
We can see it.

126
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.640
And how did you come to this conference to save.

127
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.340
Okay.

128
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.320
Okay.

129
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.430
And.

130
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.560
We can give some sides of this.

131
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.140
And this is the big chess stay.

132
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.510
And color is going to be colors though red.

133
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.610
And we can as well change the fonts tweets.

134
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.040
Font size.

135
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.810
So is this 16?

136
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.160
Okay.

137
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.870
Is country in an effort to save.

138
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.330
Okay.

139
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.710
Okay.

140
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.290
You can see.

141
00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:04.270
Now the list Thai has a property known as Subtype two, which is going to be to the middle.

142
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.240
Okay of this.

143
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.660
Okay.

144
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.660
So what's in the list?

145
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.560
I outside the room.

146
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.040
Right.

147
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.690
Okay.

148
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.230
Has the sub.

149
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.550
So try to.

150
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.640
For the subtitle is going to be a role as well.

151
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.610
Okay, children.

152
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.180
How did you come to use an associate?

153
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.210
Look for the first child.

154
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.100
Is going to be he's going to say dates.

155
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.200
Okay, original comment is contrary and excessive and good check.

156
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:45.890
Okay.

157
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.430
You can see.

158
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.500
And as well, because I just guess it's just it's tie.

159
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.020
The font size is going to be 15 and.

160
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:08.650
The caller is going to be callers quite like you can have chill come over here and as well.

161
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.850
How did you come around?

162
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.290
It sounds you right.

163
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.570
You can then have another test which is going to be for the like you can just sit and.

164
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.230
Likes.

165
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.050
Okay.

166
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.250
And you can say this.

167
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.720
You can say 12.

168
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.140
Okay.

169
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.950
Says Ty.

170
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.460
Font size of 12.

171
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.200
And we can't as well say.

172
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.110
Gets rid of this.

173
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.570
Okay.

174
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.480
CALLER?

175
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.669
No, because that's why it's.

176
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.530
Okay.

177
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.670
Great.

178
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.210
You going to sit over here?

179
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.480
Okay.

180
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.860
Now we can as well give this space sized bucks.

181
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.040
With the arguments theoretically of ten as well.

182
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.160
Okay.

183
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.980
We need to talk about the U.S. control in this.

184
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.070
Okay.

185
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.790
Great.

186
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.430
Now that year, we need that love icon.

Within the list tire as well.

189
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:25.560
We need to come out from the row within the list to see it as a property known as truly.

190
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.310
For the training.

191
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.350

Okay.

198
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.520
We can just use control as a save and check it out for us.

Okay.

206
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:16.270
Now, all we can do is we can check if we have some more data icon from the Cupertino.
