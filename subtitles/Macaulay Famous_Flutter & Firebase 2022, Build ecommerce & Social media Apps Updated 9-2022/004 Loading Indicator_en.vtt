00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.710
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.280
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.510
Now, of course, you know, when a user is trying to sign in, some of the times there might be network

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.990
delay.

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.610
And because of that the user might feel they have is not walk in because it's not getting the response

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.130
right.

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.510
Okay.

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.490
Now what they're going to do is email the user, click or log in.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.230
They're going to have a loaded subpoena over here to tell the user that, hey, we are trying to log

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.650
you.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.170
Now.

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.760
I asked you to do this right.

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.350
I think I asked you to do this.

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.070
Now, if for any reason you can't do this is fine as well.

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.460
I believe in consistency.

16
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.170
I don't really believe in this period.

17
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.840
I believe in consistency and mastery.

18
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.170
I believe, as we keep on repeating it repeatedly, to be the master of the process.

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.140
Okay.

20
00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.920
Okay.

21
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.170
So what you're going to do now in there to display that loaded subpoena?

22
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.930
They're going to create a variable.

23
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.670
They're going to create this variable over here, and this variable underscore is loaded.

24
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.150
Then they're going to set this to force the force.

25
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.590
Okay.

26
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.450
Now, you can see plus, I was to pass it time or to give it time.

27
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.470
So it's going to be a type of.

28
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.000
Because this is a true or false value.

29
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.170
Okay.

30
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.210
Now, when the.

31
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.530
Test is when is it going to trigger this function called log in.

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.910
Users with recreated above.

33
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.840
Yeah.

34
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.290
Right.

35
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.740
Okay.

36
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.890
Which create created you know, mainly with click.

37
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Sorry.

38
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.590
Where do triggered this function?

39
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.430
First of all, you're going to set the states.

40
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.900
Right.

41
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.970
Then you're going to set this loaded.

42
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.700
So on this call is loaded to.

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.150
True.

44
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.800
So this gets it loaded.

45
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.850
Okay.

46
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:14.310
Then after finish signing of the sorry.

47
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.150
After finish signing in the user, then they're going to stop the loaded spinner.

48
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.150
So they're going to start.

49
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.960
Then they're going to sit on the score is loaded, is equal to force.

50
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.290
Okay, great.

51
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.390
They're able to use this.

52
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.040
So we're going to go to our test.

53
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.730
But in.

54
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.900
Okay.

55
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.350
Right.

56
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.310
So this is.

57
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.520
Sorry, not sign up, but log in our log in version.

58
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.660
Okay.

59
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.240
Now what they're going to do is they're going to set.

60
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.840
Underscore is loaded.

61
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.450
If the score is loaded.

62
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.200
Then that is this is true.

63
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.020
This tannery question mark is true.

64
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.030
If it is true, then we want to center for that.

65
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.180
We want to say that in this widget we are going to use.

66
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.760
So we're going to decide it's going to be.

67
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.120
The Circular Progress Indicator.

68
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.770
Now, what you can do since the background is in black, what you can do, you can set the color to

69
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.310
colors.

70
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.710
That's why it's okay.

71
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.410
Else so this is a square as we just want to display the tests.

72
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.200
Okay, so if you have any or you can just over on there or he's going to tell you what to do.

73
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.130
Okay.

74
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.870
Now what is control and has to save?

75
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.320
Okay.

76
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.140
Okay.

77
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.840
Now let's try to fill in.

78
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.390
So fields that's in the we have a username card.

79
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.370
I mean, it's so not easy.

80
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.500
And then we have an account that is just attached to it, an email called admin at G-mail.

81
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.010
So.

82
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.360
J.M..

83
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.670
She emailed.

84
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.310
It's calm.

85
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.190
Sorry.

86
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.550
Then the password is C.

87
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.650
Now click on log in.

88
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.370
Now we are having this arrow which displays hits was not the same.

89
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.120
The reason is that over the odd quarter the than the log in users we have made an error.

90
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.320
We have made a mistake.

91
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.890
Okay.

92
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:06.490
Now, over here we are saying if email is not empty and a password is empty, you can see this two does

93
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.840
not go together.

94
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:15.910
And we are using this hand when using this and we have the whole how we have the right when using this

95
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.300
and the symptom is good value must be true.

96
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.120
That is more.

97
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.570
Both requirements must be met.

98
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.150
Now over here you can see both requirements are not meant for value asset.

99
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.930
If it is not empty, then we are saying if it is empty, I think what is going to get confused so this

100
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.320
is going to be is anti but is not.

101
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.110
Okay.

102
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.440
So if email dots is not empty, the password is not empty.

103
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.150
So this was a very big mistake I made.

104
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.060
Suddenly you did not read it as well.

105
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.910
Okay.

106
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.870
Great.

107
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.210
Now what we're going to do is just two or three studies.

108
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.980
Okay.

109
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.590
Hopefully you able separate out yourself.

110
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.270
Okay.

111
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.680
Okay.

112
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.000
Okay.

113
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.580
Now we're going to sign in if for any reason you've forgotten the log in this case.

114
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.010
So the accounts you created, you can also just create a new word.

115
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.200
Okay.

116
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.700
Now I think about one of the accounts we created is at the at --.

117
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.360
That's calm and the password is.

118
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.510
We see.

119
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.440
Sorry.

120
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.660
So they're going to click on log in.

121
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.390
Okay.

122
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.620
So you can see the log load and speed, right?

123
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.210
Great.

124
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.830
Now I think the account has been created, so that's in the account.

125
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.240
I think a lot of an issue with standing up and.

126
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.500
Using the word which signing up sign it name.

127
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.050
So the account has been signed in all the account as being logged in.

128
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.190
Okay.

129
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.940
So they're going to check out that to confirm this because everybody said you are now logged in on the

130
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.230
bug council.

131
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.740
Okay.

132
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.380
Great.

133
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.580
That is fine.

134
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.020
I did talk on this.

135
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.160
Not about user.

136
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.710
This is the idea of the user.

137
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.090
Right.

138
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.870
And it says.

139
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.700
And I love that.

140
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.050
Great.

141
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.240
So now you have other assignments.

142
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.240
The assignment is what's it going to do?

143
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.310
Email to click.

144
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.480
Email to the user, not me or we, but the user.

145
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.240
That is everybody as a whole that is using the app.

146
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.650
Now, immediately the user clicks on the log in.

147
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.510
We want to clear this fields.

148
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.970
That is the email fields and the password field.

149
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.790
So you're going to pause the video and do this now, whether the user click or log in, they're going

150
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.610
to play the value of this field fields.

151
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.990
That is an email that the PGA Works.

152
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.130
They're going to play both fields.

153
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.100
Okay, so now pause this video and it's like, you guys, see you in the next lecture.
