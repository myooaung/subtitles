00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.859
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.750
In this lecture, we are going to be able to switch from one bottom navigation bar item.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.830
So the order.

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.770
Okay, now in order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VTS code.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.670
Now the first step is to create a variable via.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.850
Which is going to be a number.

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.520
So it is a data type of event and we can call this on the score selected.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.680
Item.

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
Then we're going to need to set it to zero.

11
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.340
We will need to update the UI in order to update the UI.

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.270
We need to use the set state and in order to use the state, we need to use a stateful widget.

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.110
So what we can do, we can alight this and use controller and dots, then convert to stateful widgets.

14
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.010
Okay.

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.730
Now use true and save.

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.740
Now it's in the bottom navigation bar.

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.640
The bottom navigation bar has a property known as current index.

18
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.730
Okay.

19
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:17.650
For the current index we're going to need to say on the score selected item default it zero.

20
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.400
Right.

21
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.880
So this is going to be the first item we have.

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.370
That is the whole assignment we change this to.

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.320
Two one.

24
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.510
One use controls to save.

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.900
And it's going to be the second item.

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.060
We can just halt to studies.

27
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.940
Well, it's restarting and it's going to be the.

28
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.590
The second.

29
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.010
Item check.

30
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.340
Okay.

31
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.460
You can see it now, the second item and so on.

32
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.520
Now within the bottom navigation bar, the bottom navigation bar has the well has a property known as

33
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.380
on tap, which is a function.

34
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.980
And over this parenthesis, we're going to pass in something known as indents, which you can see as

35
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.170
the value of this.

36
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.610
This does this, this.

37
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.050
And.

38
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.960
We need this.

39
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.780
And over here, we are going to set stage in that to update the UI.

40
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.280
And now we just have to cover this to zero.

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.890
Okay.

42
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.320
And now we're going to need to call that on the score selected.

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
Item is going to be equal to this index.

44
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.440
So we are basically saying we want to update the index right now is control to save.

45
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.730
And click on this.

46
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.850
Okay.

47
00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.730
You can see.

48
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.520
Okay.

49
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.530
Now I'm just going to come back to this again.

50
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.750
Now, the first thing we did was to create a variable which we called on the score selected item, and

51
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.830
it is a type of number, so it is a type of int and therefore we are setting it zero, which is going

52
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.900
to be the first bottom navigation bar item that is the home.

53
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.290
And over here we send the bottom navigation bar.

54
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.390
The bottom navigation bar has a property known as current index and we are saying it's going to be set

55
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.900
to zero.

56
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.910
You can just see it as this.

57
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.700
Okay.

58
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.980
So you are saying it's going to be set to zero.

59
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:52.070
And as well, the bottom navigation bar has a property known as on tap, which is a function within

60
00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:00.050
the parentheses we pass in the index, which is referring to each of the bottom navigation bar value.

61
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:08.930
And over here we are set state because in the dates of the DUI, we have to set the state and we're

62
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.110
basically calling this variable called underscore.

63
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.200
Selected item, then we are updating it.

64
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.180
Remember I said you can see this in this as the value of whatever.

65
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.250
That is.

66
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.490
Yeah.

67
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.700
So you can see this as the value that is one zero.

68
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.060
So it basically updates this to whatever value fully understand this.

69
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.490
So that's how easy it is.

70
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.320
Now what we can also do, we can make this bottom navigation bar fixed.

71
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.070
That is, we don't want this animation to.

72
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.120
Let's do this way.

73
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:55.760
What we can do is the bottom navigation bar has a property known as type, and we can then say bottom.

74
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.520
Navigation.

75
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.160
By type.

76
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.580
Dods.

77
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.310
You can see shifting I think the efforts.

78
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.610
We have this often, and that is why you can see it this way.

79
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.310
You can see when you click on this, I think the bottom navigation bar is shifting.

80
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.180
So we don't want this, but you can just go with this design.

81
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.400
But we want the the fist is control and let's save.

82
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.990
And.

83
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.220
Try this out.

84
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.090
Okay.

85
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.220
Not longer shifts.

86
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.580
And right now you can see the color.

87
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.800
And the reason for that is said the selected item color is going to be color and the selected item color

88
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.630
is going to be color black.

89
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.340
So whenever we select any of the item, it's going to have that color.

90
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.190
And then once we did not sell that, it's going to be black.

91
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.840
So you can just have your own design.

92
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.040
Probably yours could be red for the selected item color and for the selected icon.

93
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.340
The selected item color use can be probably purple or pink or whatever.

94
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.130
So you can just go with your own style, okay?

95
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.170
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
