00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.380
Hi, Walker.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.650
In this lecture, they're going to display the product description.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:11.730
Now, to do this, they're gonna need to go back to the code and then the detailed directory and then

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.810
the detail page.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.200
Okay.

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.840
Now we can use control and B to make this right.

7
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.200
Okay.

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.050
Now, we're going to be doing this outside the raw, right?

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.280
Because the raw is for this test widget and this echo widget.

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.490
Right.

11
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.850
Okay.

12
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.470
So what we can then do is we can have a critical area.

13
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.520
Right.

14
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.940
Okay.

15
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.830
Within the column.

16
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.350
We can then.

17
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.170
It says widgets.

18
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.480
Okay.

19
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.360
So we can easily just copy the.

20
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.010
You can.

21
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.610
Sorry.

22
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.330
From here.

23
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.010
And we can use contra AC to copy.

24
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.450
In a way we can use control and veto peace.

25
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.290
So the next ten years we going to bring them to discussion.

26
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.290
This crucial right.

27
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.390
Okay, great.

28
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.040
Now you control an associate.

29
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.349
Okay, great.

30
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.420
So now what we can just do is over here.

31
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.650
But it's cool because they cross us assignments, cross us elements to start.

32
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.580
Cross alignment or static is true.

33
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.330
So the trick in this country is to save.

34
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay.

35
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.930
Now you can see this of a size is not going to the left to this edge because of we already have this

36
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.550
part in of a.

37
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.520
Despite it.

38
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.790
Right.

39
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.000
Okay.

40
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.570
So what we can also do, we can do same for this.

41
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.770
So we can use country and dots and rub this with the pardon.

42
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.390
Okay.

43
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.210
Wrap with.

44
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.650
Pardon.

45
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.340
Okay.

46
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.890
So is it a fall?

47
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.350
We can use a symmetric to say we only want to give for the right and top to bottom.

48
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.630
Okay.

49
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.930
So we're going to use the results here and we can see horizontal is.

50
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.530
It's going to be the same to us 25.

51
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.500
So it becomes it's close to the same size or the same points.

52
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.860
Okay.

53
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.820
So there's going to be a response.

54
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.620
Hard to be 25.

55
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.950
Okay.

56
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.920
Now use culture and excessive.

57
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.720
You're going to see it are the same sports.

58
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.820
Okay, great.

59
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.590
Now, what you can also do is we can have some style of air because this tie so close tie.

60
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.980
Right.

61
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.480
And it's going to be test time.

62
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.380
Okay.

63
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.240
We can first give a call or two.

64
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.670
This is going to be callers to Gray.

65
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.020
Gray.

66
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.590
Okay.

67
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.380
Hopefully I can spell.

68
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.860
Great.

69
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.260
Okay.

70
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.770
Great.

71
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.170
Then we can say that it's capacity of.

72
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.330
Capacity of zero deaths.

73
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.350
Seven.

74
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.170
Okay.

75
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.150
Now we're in this.

76
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.120
Okay.

77
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.890
I think.

78
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.210
We are missing one additional parenthesis and add to trigger coma and additional coma and use control

79
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.990
and this to save.

80
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.730
And go check it out.

81
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.270
Okay.

82
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.670
I think we're just gonna get rid of this.

83
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.730
And probably a height of 1 to 7.

84
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.590
In case we have lots of tests.

85
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.790
She's going give some space.

86
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.170
Okay.

87
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.000
Okay.

88
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.800
Now, what you can also do is you can say fonts.

89
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.080
Fonts.

90
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.500
Weeds.

91
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.670
Fonts, widths.

92
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.240
The words that the Syrian dread say it won't be that boat.

93
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.080
Okay.

94
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.780
I think this is way too weird.

95
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.950
Okay.

96
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.829
Okay.

97
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.459
I think this is okay.

98
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.570
Probably we can just do it like that and change the font size from the it's in us.

99
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.280
See, I going to look like.

100
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.250
Okay.

101
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.080
I think this is okay.

102
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.390
Yeah.

103
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.240
Probably 15 this year is going to look like.

104
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.210
Like.

105
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.970
Okay.

106
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.990
I think this is okay.

107
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.430
Okay.

108
00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.140
So in this lecture, we're going to be able to have the price and as well a bottle of air in it.

109
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.970
That's a hard this item to cost.

110
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.360
Okay.

111
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.150
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
