00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.550
A guy's walk home now successfully created an account, and this folder called Profiles has been created.

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.550
Now I'm going to click on this and you can see this is the image I uploaded and we said is going to

3
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.560
be the UID of the user.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.370
That is the name of the image is going to be the UID of the user.

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.340
And over here in the store we said we are going to upload the image.

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.360
Right?

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.740
And this is the image of it.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.110
We can open this URL.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.950
You can just copy.

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.910
You can use contour and a highlights and we can paste this in a new tab.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.470
And you're going to say it's okay.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.210
You can see.

13
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:53.340
But unfortunately the rest user do not have this image right or do not have a profile image.

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.440
So what we can do is we can just delete the user user's collection and let's have a new word.

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.180
Sir.

16
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.230
Delete.

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.970
Okay.

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.220
So any user, all users now are going to have the profile image.

19
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.690
Okay.

20
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.310
Now we don't have any users collection.

21
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.900
So what we can then do is we can create a new user.

22
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.190
Okay.

23
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210
I'm just going to say, my colleague.

24
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.520
My colleague.

25
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.050
I call the poor and the.

26
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.860
This is going to be mark poor at Gmail.

27
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.410
It's calm and the password is going to be this.

28
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.000
So you can click on sign up.

29
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.540
Okay.

30
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.080
And since we do not have that Jesus collection, it's going to be automatically created.

31
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.150
And over year we're going to have an additional image, right?

32
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.150
So you can just check if it does me.

33
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.870
Okay, this is done and.

34
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.210
Let's check this out.

35
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.280
Go to this.

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.410
And.

37
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.860
Go to this.

38
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.530
Okay.

39
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.150
Now you can see the user.

40
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.900
The email is my port and the full name is Mark.

41
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.240
Sorry, the him is my poor Jimmy.

42
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.830
The scum.

43
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.450
Right.

44
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.380
Then the full name is Mark Poor.

45
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.430
And this is the image.

46
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.060
Right.

47
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.340
I just went ahead with the previous image where you can upload something else.

48
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.000
Okay.

49
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:41.460
And we can check the storage, navigates the roots and head back to this OC This is the dietary.

50
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.310
We are all our users which are going to be stored, right?

51
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.080
So we can then click on this.

52
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.810
And this is a why we basically said the image is going to be the UID of the user.

53
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.110
Okay.

54
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.970
Now, so let's compare this.

55
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.320
So I'm going to open this new tab, this authentication in the new tab.

56
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.580
And.

57
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.440
Mark poor.

58
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.550
And this is to job, you see.

59
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.050
And yet we have to W.C. Right.

60
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.420
Basically said the name of the image is going to be the UID of the user.

61
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.430
Okay, great.

62
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.920
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
