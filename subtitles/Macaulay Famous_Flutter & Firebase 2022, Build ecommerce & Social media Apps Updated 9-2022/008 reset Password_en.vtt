00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.589
Hi, guys, welcome.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.350
That is lecture regular creative functionality to send the password reset linked to the user.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.070
Okay, now to do this, I'm going to go back to our visa code.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.180
Okay.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.340
Now, if for any reason you can still do it, I think is defined, but hopefully if I should do it this

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.650
time, you're going to get the process.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.700
Okay.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.330
So this is where the log in users function and right of are all they.

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.560
Over here.

10
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.580
Okay.

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.300
Yeah.

12
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.950
So there's.

13
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.200
It's.

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.910
Right.

15
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.240
And this was the snack bar we created, whether we did it outside the arts, cultural or class.

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.140
Right.

17
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.050
So you don't see this.

18
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.380
It's up.

19
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.060
Or just what I'm just going to do.

20
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.760
I guess we'll take this to.

21
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.380
So far.

22
00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.830
Okay.

23
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.290
Great.

24
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.500
So this is the.

25
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.550
This is where the log in users function ends.

26
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.950
So they're able to create another function and they're going to call this function forgot.

27
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.840
Password.

28
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.150
Password.

29
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.200
Right.

30
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.620
Okay.

31
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.370
Now we just have one field.

32
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.600
That is the email.

33
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.700
So over the past years, that field of I, it is a test.

34
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
So it is a data type of string.

35
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.320
Okay.

36
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.130
Now I'm going to pass in this sink since I'm going to be using the weights.

37
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.880
Okay.

38
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.140
Great.

39
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.630
Now they're going to use the word the if.

40
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.180
And so before we do that, we can just create a variable to study possible error.

41
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.800
So you can see some.

42
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.120
Error occurred.

43
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.670
Okay.

44
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.760
They can see it wants us to type.

45
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.790
So this is a test.

46
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.450
Right.

47
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.090
So it is a type of string.

48
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.350
Okay.

49
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.780
Now we can use to try and catch.

50
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.330
Okay, great.

51
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.180
Now for the tri regular first check if the MFA is valid or not.

52
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.070
So you're going to use the if statements.

53
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.050
So we're going to see if email.

54
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.770
Yeah.

55
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.750
Is that is not and to make sure you don't type the is empty.

56
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.350
So you're going to face the same issue I was just before.

57
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.510
Okay.

58
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.640
If it is not empty, then we are going to see it.

59
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.210
It's so firebase.

60
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.500
It's right.

61
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.720
Then there's going to be Dodd's.

62
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.270
Said Password reset email server.

63
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.410
The power of the email.

64
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.270
You can see it automatically positive email.

65
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.740
Okay, so this is what I basically asked you to do.

66
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.950
So we can with this.

67
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.530
Right.

68
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.220
Okay.

69
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.630
So this was a task to do.

70
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.260
Okay.

71
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.030
We can also get the river to Sussex.

72
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.100
So we can.

73
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.470
The rest is equal to.

74
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.080
So this is the reset link, as we've said since a visa.

75
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.470
Okay.

76
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.890
Now we can have the spots where they.

77
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.800
So evidence of race is required to.

78
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.830
Emails.

79
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.220
This because of what field you can just specify that this email email failed.

80
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:58.740
If I EOD if I EOD pro leak or it is valid email field was not b and to appear C no grades.

81
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.390
Okay.

82
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.940
Now, if for any reason this is not the issue, we just want to catch the hero.

83
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.470
So we're going to see race is equal to E!

84
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.090
That's just straight.

85
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.980
Right.

86
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.440
Then we can return.

87
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.450
Times.

88
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.400
RAZ.

89
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.980
Okay.

90
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.580
Great.

91
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.730
So this is basically is you can see similar to this.

92
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.930
The other different is we just have one field.

93
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.510
Right.

94
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.260
We just have one field.

95
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.470
So this is the wholly different.

96
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.230
You can also store this results.

97
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.610
So the results.

98
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.210
Sorry not the you can adjust or this results in a variable rate so you can store.

99
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.770
Oh sorry.

100
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.900
This results in a variable.

101
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.510
So as I see you are log in such a similar level, you can just leave it like this.

102
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.030
So this was what I asked you to do.

103
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.860
You can still do it openly.

104
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.360
You can do it now, right?

105
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.440
Because you need to master the process of natural understanding.

106
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.360
You need to try to master it.

107
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.350
Right.

108
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.180
So this basically is.

109
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.220
All right.

110
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.400
Okay.

111
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.800
So now in in this lecture, implement this.

112
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.650
But before we implement this, they really try to do this yourself.

113
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.440
I'm just going to show you what you're going to do if you're going to use control necessary this first.

114
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.170
So we're going to go to our forgot password, right?

115
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.940
Okay.

116
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.630
They know not to have access to this value.

117
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.250
You're going to create a controller for it.

118
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.170
So you're going to create a controller and you're going to buy it to the food, which I was showing

119
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.740
you before.

120
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.500
Then also, you can.

121
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.720
Make the function work you can implement, you can make that function.

122
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.820
We just created work.

123
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.570
So to do that, it's going to be similar to this.

124
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.100
So you can never know what we did there.

125
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.230
This is going to be similar to this log in function or log into user's function.

126
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.720
So just like this.

127
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.400
So try to implement this yourself.

128
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.890
Okay.

129
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.900
Okay, guys.

130
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.700
This big.
