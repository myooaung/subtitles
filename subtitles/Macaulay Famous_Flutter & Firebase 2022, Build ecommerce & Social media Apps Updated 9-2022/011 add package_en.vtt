00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi, guys, welcome.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.800
That is lecture hot.

3
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.310
So packages are going to be needed at our hub.

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.640
Now head up to pump dirt dev.

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.470
Now the first package I'm going to be using is to get this right.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.680
So over here in the search for get.

7
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.030
Okay.

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.190
They click on this over this first order.

9
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.590
We're now going to copy the code over here.

10
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.090
They're going to head up to our VSA code.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.850
Then the prospect will say, okay, now we're going to pass this onto the dependencies.

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.620
So over here, the same line with the flutter of the Lopezes.

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.430
Okay.

14
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.740
We're not going to lose control.

15
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.100
That's the save for now.

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.750
So we're going to go back.

17
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.570
The other package are going to be needed.

18
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.800
Is the cloud faster?

19
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.730
So search for cloud first.

20
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.410
Click on this first one over there.

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.610
Then they're going to copy the code as well.

22
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.790
Has got to go to the court.

23
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.600
They were going to do this after this.

24
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.210
Cupertino icons.

25
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.580
So is this okay?

26
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.220
Great.

27
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.190
Now I'm going to go to this.

28
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.300
Okay.

29
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.240
The package is a firebase call, so I'm going to click on this over here.

30
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.700
Okay.

31
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.730
Is going to wait for my network.

32
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.900
I'm also going to go to this.

33
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.870
The search for fab is art.

34
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.370
Click on this.

35
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.900
Okay.

36
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.780
So that was a copy.

37
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.130
This is cool.

38
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.310
Paste.

39
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.910
This was a.

40
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.330
Okay.

41
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.420
What's going to be needed for this art.

42
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.970
Okay.

43
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.009
Is this over a.

44
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.090
Okay.

45
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.080
Now as close to our human rights.

46
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.850
So, again, we needed to.

47
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.310
Uh, I think a package card.

48
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.580
It's going to head up to the pub that they're okay.

49
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
The cloud.

50
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.280
Sorry.

51
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.860
I think fire up is.

52
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.410
Sturridge Yeah.

53
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.490
Great.

54
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.660
So click on this.

55
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.270
Okay.

56
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.740
Copy this.

57
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.230
Over.

58
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.010
Okay.

59
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.640
Priest as well.

60
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.220
Okay.

61
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.310
Now, also, we're going to be able to pick image either from our gallery or camera so as well.

62
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.410
I'm going to go back to the probe that they've put this link over there.

63
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.260
They're able to search for image recall.

64
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.260
Okay, great.

65
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.170
So I'm going to copy this as well.

66
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.850
Go back to.

67
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.330
Okay.

68
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.860
Okay.

69
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.770
Now, if we need to hide it later.

70
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.210
Okay.

71
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.890
So we had the the cloud fast to the fab is called.

72
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.240
The fab is out.

73
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.080
The Firebase Storage, the image picker.

74
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.570
Now, you're going to see what all this does later.

75
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.440
Okay.

76
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.610
Now we're going to use control on this to save that, to get all the packages.

77
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.980
Now, after you finish getting the packages, it is very needful for you to close your vehicle.

78
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.590
Then we.

79
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.800
It's okay enough for it to grab that recent change.

80
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.160
Okay.

81
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.260
So after my finishes, I'm going to close it.

82
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.460
There is status, so make sure you do.

83
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.010
Same for us.

84
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.270
Okay, guys.

85
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.500
