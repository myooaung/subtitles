00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.290
In this lecture, we're going to have two Chesterfields.

4
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.000
One is going to be for the room ID, the other is going to be for the user name.

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.220
They already know how to walk with their shoes.

6
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.460
Right.

7
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.610
So you can follow this video and see if you can do this yourself.

8
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.060
Okay.

9
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.350
Now, like I said, we're going to have to test fields.

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.810
One is going to be for the ID and the other is going to be for the user, a user.

11
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.460
And they look at both those fields are going to be displayed vertically.

12
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.410
That is from top to bottom.

13
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.770
Now, to do this, they need to go back to the court fully.

14
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.810
Now, outside the app bar, the scaffold, we are going to have the body right on.

15
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.100
Like I said, the two test fields are going to be displayed vertically.

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.370
So they're going to be using Nikola Widgets for this.

17
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.340
And as you know, this column can take multiple widgets.

18
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.320
It tells the to do it.

19
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.920
Therefore the first charge is going to be the first just filter.

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.460
Right.

21
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.090
Okay.

22
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.550
Great.

23
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.050
Now what you're going to do first?

24
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.510
They're going to specify the type of the touch field.

25
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.380
So I'm going to say a keyboard type is going to be a fields.

26
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.880
So it says test appeals.

27
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.190
Time, then there's going to be a number.

28
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.250
Great.

29
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.950
Now we can specify the last line whilst linked to the.

30
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.180
So we're not last names for bass lines to.

31
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.270
She the one.

32
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.870
Okay.

33
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.330
Now we can then have the declaration that is going to be imputes declaration.

34
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.450
Right.

35
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.910
Okay.

36
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:04.000
Now what you're going to first do is the cancer sequel is going to be secondary called Secondary and

37
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.530
Cole.

38
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.850
Great.

39
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.310
Now you can also Field two crew.

40
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.360
Great.

41
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.970
Now it doesn't get rid of the border.

42
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.990
So you can say border.

43
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.940
There's going to be a huge.

44
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.890
If you don't know, he's got around to see if I'm going to check what you've done so far.

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.110
Okay.

46
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.920
Great.

47
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.680
Now we can have an intel, which I said is more like a placeholder.

48
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.110
Right?

49
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.810
So for the interest is just going to say, roll it.

50
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.660
Right.

51
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.550
To recover and go and check.

52
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.860
Okay.

53
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.090
Now, what you can do can take this I.D. test to the center and you have access to that property to

54
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.110
the outside, the Empire Declaration within the test shield.

55
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.670
I just want to say it as a line.

56
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.020
It's going to be test.

57
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.640
Line.

58
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.730
The Arts Center.

59
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.990
Okay, great.

60
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.820
Then go check it out.

61
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.740
Okay.

62
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.430
Great.

63
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.850
Great.

64
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.040
Now we can have unadvertised field rights, so we can simply copy this.

65
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:36.320
Audio trail, ray and controller and v to face is going to be the user name.

66
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.840
Okay.

67
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.300
He's going to turn this to save and go check what he just did.

68
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.960
Okay, great.

69
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.280
I can see there is no space.

70
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.910
So now to give the space to user privacy, we used them before.

71
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.760
That is the size box.

72
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.280
Size works right there.

73
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.980
Give it the space vertically so there's going to be height.

74
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.960
Ides of May.

75
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.870
We often you can just check changes later if there's no great artist.

76
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.040
Okay, great.

77
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.340
Right now, we can give you a pardon to the fall.

78
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.810
So we tend to impute Decoration Day as something or as content fodder.

79
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.700
We can see it in sets.

80
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.750
That's all sides of the the plaintiff and just check to see what it does.

81
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.030
Okay.

82
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.040
I think it made it much.

83
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.660
Bigger.

84
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.530
Right.

85
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.730
Okay.

86
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.130
But really, we're just going to say ten.

87
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.090
Okay.

88
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.190
I'm going to do the same thing for.

89
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.200
So content Prada is going to be it sets.

90
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.010
You wouldn't know what part in those rights is head to toe then.

91
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.820
Ten as well.

92
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.810
Okay.

93
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.260
And go check it out to see what it does immediately.

94
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.760
Okay.

95
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.020
Great.

96
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.890
Great.

97
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.310
Right.

98
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.000
Okay.

99
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.140
Now we have the ID.

100
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.460
We as well.

101
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.510
We're just going to use a copy editor for this room.

102
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.680
I'd like.

103
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.780
Okay.

104
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.680
Great.

105
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.270
Okay, guys.

106
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.740
See you in an ethnic.
