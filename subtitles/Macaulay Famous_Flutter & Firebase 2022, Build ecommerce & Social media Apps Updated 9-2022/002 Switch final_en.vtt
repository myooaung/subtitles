00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.610
Or come in this lecture regular, make this switchable not to do this.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm going to need to go back to verse code, then the video calls screen.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.410
Then I'm going to need to use control and be in order to make this white.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.040
Okay.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.880
Now, instead of creating the functionality over this block in that to make our code more cleaner,

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.150
what you can do is before this last.

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.240
Holly Brackett.

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.970
We can then create dysfunction over here.

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.790
And they're going to call this function on.

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.290
Or do you?

12
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.280
And all you.

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.290
Muted.

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.280
Then be able to pass the parenthesis, then call the brackets over this parentheses, regular pass and

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.180
the ball.

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.230
Then I looked past the available card value.

17
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.860
I'm just going to use the short form of the VAR is referred to the values, referring to what the user

18
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.540
is going to pick.

19
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.040
That is either so off the switch or on the switch.

20
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.640
Okay.

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.130
Now, the next thing we're going to do is we're going to need to update the UI to the correct value.

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.740
That is what used to be the peak.

23
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.150
Okay.

24
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.430
Now, to do that, to update the UI are going to be something known as set state.

25
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.680
Okay.

26
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.570
Now please note the cell states will only work if you are currently using a set widget.

27
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.010
So if for any reason you're not using a state for widget, you can then.

28
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.810
Highlights, then use control and dots and convert it to widgets.

29
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.800
Okay.

30
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.190
Now, all of these states, all we just have to see now is to call their verbal card is all you.

31
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.030
We had said then ruggedness is equal to the value.

32
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.970
That is what these guys will pick.

33
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.870
Now, you can see we can't have access to this is.

34
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.000
That's just we can't use it.

35
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.660
And it's because it is a finer variable.

36
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.530
So in order to get rid of that era, we just have to get rid of this finer.

37
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.730
And for this as well.

38
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.600
This finer.

39
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.370
They use control and se to save this fire.

40
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.660
Then.

41
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.110
Instead of this, you're going to need to get rid of this bill because we already passed it here as

42
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.440
well.

43
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.020
Okay.

44
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.050
So, Dad, they're going to call the.

45
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.180
On you.

46
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.060
You said they're going to get rid of this.

47
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.080
Okay.

48
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.770
There is control and SASE and go check what you just did.

49
00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.840
Okay.

50
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.000
I can see it is now switchable.

51
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.170
Okay.

52
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.270
Now over a year, they're going to create another function caught on video, we said.

53
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.010
As well.

54
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.780
Double the price of the value.

55
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.060
That is what this is going to peak.

56
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.000
That is the type of bull.

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.290
This is a true and false value.

58
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.960
They going to need to update the UI.

59
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.290
So what's the usage?

60
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.140
This says states then is going to be is video.

61
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.810
We had said it's going to be equal to the final version of what user picked.

62
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.640
Okay, great.

63
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.580
Now as well.

64
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.380
They're going to need to get rid of this.

65
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.410
And also, the bowl system already participates in the function and is going to be on.

66
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.220
Video.

67
00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.500
You said, right.

68
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
Okay, they're going to get rid of this.

69
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.220
Okay.

70
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.170
Is this a safe?

71
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.190
And go check it out.

72
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.940
Okay.

73
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.780
You can see.

74
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.020
It is now switch wives.

75
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:22.050
Now, what they're going to do next is instead of the static value to regularly use the is.

76
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.380
Audio VHS is going to be what this is going to switch to.

77
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.880
And this as well is video.

78
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.010
Muted.

79
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.690
Okay.

80
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.030
Right.

81
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.570
Okay.

82
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.960
Now you can go check it out now.

83
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.460
Over here.

84
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.010
I can do this.

85
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.600
And over here I can give her the idea of one to.

86
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.570
I think.

87
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.110
Okay.

88
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.090
Want to.

89
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:15.480
Two, four, five, six, seven, eight and click on join with.

90
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.030
Okay.

91
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.260
You're going to see it works.

92
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.380
Okay.

93
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.530
We're just going to wait a while.

94
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.060
You can see they're telling you to your mitten.

95
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.830
It's just going to take some while.

96
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.550
Okay.

97
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.720
You can see currently right is walk in.

98
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.740
So what you can do can also tell us for the video and.

99
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.760
Okay.

100
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.200
Now we can do this and go check it out.

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.650
We're going to see now video is going to show.

102
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.390
Okay.

103
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.970
You can see.

104
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.680
Great.

105
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.810
Good.

106
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.410
Okay.

107
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.730
So it's good.

108
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.000
Now.

109
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.120
What else we can do?

110
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.920
I think we made a mistake over this.

111
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.690
Function?

112
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.770
Yes.

113
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.700
With Controller.

114
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.100
Over here, we said.

115
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.820
If the username is empty.

116
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.990
That is, if the user wants to go with this.

117
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.890
Dan wants a creative rebel.

118
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.940
So this.

119
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.490
Right.

120
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.640
Else we just want to.

121
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.440
Osoyoos that what we created.

122
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.370
Don't do this.

123
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.210
We won't do it.

124
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.920
Won't is that we will create to store what the user is then.

125
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.570
Going to take.

126
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.580
Right.

127
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.970
Okay.

128
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.620
So what you're going to do is instead of this, they're going to get rid of this.

129
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.550
And passed in the name.

130
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.190
Right.

131
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.920
But still the name is a variable.

132
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.480
Also, then the.

133
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.930
This one is called controller, that user, the display name.

134
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.350
Right.

135
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.690
So it is a choice to go with.

136
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:24.360
We start with the default name, with the default display name where they are, we were able to store

137
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.240
that here as they display name or else.

138
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.500
You're going to just go with the name.

139
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.920
These are choices, right?

140
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.900
This ought to be.

141
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.340
Yeah.

142
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.080
The name are not this on this court control that he's in in this one.

143
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.530
Okay.

144
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.350
So you can use my collar.

145
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.230
Paul.

146
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.610
You will.

147
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.250
Then we check this out.

148
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.080
The to.

149
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.870
Hopefully we did not see we did not see this.

150
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.190
Okay.

151
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.980
You can just try that out yourself.

152
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.620
And I know this will definitely work in.

153
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.710
Okay.

154
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.500
You can see because we turn on our video.

155
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.570
Right.

156
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.030
Okay.

157
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.650
So now what you can't do.

158
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.730
You can't just call this.

159
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.740
Is going to click on this.

160
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.650
Okay.

161
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.260
Great.

162
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.640
Sounds good, right?

163
00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:32.510
Okay.

164
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.700
Sounds good.

165
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.230
Okay.

166
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.559
I just would keep on doing now and see.

167
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.880
You can see it now.

168
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.860
MP Okay, great.

169
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.660
Is this.

170
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.020
Okay.

171
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.940
Sounds good, right?

172
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.330
Okay.

173
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.460
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
