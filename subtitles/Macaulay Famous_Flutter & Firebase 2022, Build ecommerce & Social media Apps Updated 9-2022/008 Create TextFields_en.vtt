00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.690
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.500
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.160
In this lecture, we're going to create two test fields, okay?

4
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.210
One is going to be for the song name, and the other is going to be for the couch.

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.370
Okay, not to do this.

6
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.600
You're going to be doing this.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.250
Would send the single charge.

8
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.700
Screw you.

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.090
Right.

10
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.270
And you know, the reason for the single cheese scroll view is because we want to be able to scroll

11
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.240
this screen page.

12
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.660
Okay.

13
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.420
Now to do this, okay, first of all, this is how to treat a comma over in order to get it.

14
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.340
Very good from that.

15
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.680
Okay.

16
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.300
I think that's very important.

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.690
Okay.

18
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.790
Now what you're going to be doing is the first widgets are going to be isn't is going to be a size.

19
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:48.820
But the reason for this size works is we want to give space between this video and then this widgets

20
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.880
are going to be is and that is going to be the test field for the song name.

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.320
Okay.

22
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.130
So we can give this pairs, give it the space vertically, right?

23
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.410
So this is definitely going to be height.

24
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.380
We can give this piece of techy.

25
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.830
Okay.

26
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.170
Great.

27
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.900
And now that we can have the true comma.

28
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.350
Okay.

29
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.390
And now we can have the tests.

30
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.610
Test fields.

31
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.480
You've seen this before.

32
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.930
Okay.

33
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.580
As you know, the test field has a property known as Worth Decoration, and this is going to be imputes

34
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.080
decoration.

35
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.790
Okay.

36
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.900
And as you know, the decoration has a property.

37
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.610
None that's in the test means test, not a protest.

38
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.180
Okay.

39
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.230
And it can say a song name.

40
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.010
Okay.

41
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.520
Okay.

42
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.030
And now we can now the border and we can say we want border at all sides.

43
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.870
Right.

44
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.570
So to do that, we have this property known as hotline episodes border.

45
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.280
Okay, great.

46
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.510
Okay.

47
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.330
Now, what we can now do is to use contra and this to save what's before dad.

48
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.360
You don't need to have the attorney trying to come over that.

49
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.180
Okay.

50
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.810
And.

51
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.800
Okay.

52
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.360
Nice to see a click on this.

53
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.930
And click on.

54
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.750
Gallery and.

55
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.970
Click on this.

56
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.940
Okay, great.

57
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.940
You can see the view and you can see the videos playing and we have the song name over it.

58
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.510
Okay, now go back.

59
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.320
Okay.

60
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.940
Now you can see the video is still playing and we are no longer in Dad's screen, but still we are still

61
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.610
playing the video.

62
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.930
Not to get rid of that, we're going to be using something known as just suppose that simply means is

63
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.290
going to tail floated out hey we are no longer in that screen so we don't want is we want to stop playing

64
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.770
that video since we are no longer in that screen.

65
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.500
Or probably we have another filter that hey, we have used this and we don't want to in the war.

66
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.710
Okay, so that's what this pause is.

67
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.120
So cue now to do that, you're going to need to tell flow time.

68
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.860
So just pause.

69
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.180
Okay.

70
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
We can then call that variable controller.

71
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.940
Okay.

72
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.070
Controller, start.

73
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.160
Disperse.

74
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.590
Okay.

75
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.620
This simply means we are done with you.

76
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.820
We don't need you anymore.

77
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.300
Okay.

78
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.640
I fully understand what it does now.

79
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.230
Okay.

80
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.750
Now we can use culture and excessive and.

81
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.610
All we can do is to try to had.

82
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.930
If we do again.

83
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.370
Okay.

84
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.520
Hard gallery and.

85
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.960
You can have this and.

86
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.600
Okay.

87
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.260
Okay.

88
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.080
Now go back, goats on that screen.

89
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.650
You can see now the video starts.

90
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.100
Okay.

91
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.010
So that's the use of the disciples.

92
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.560
If you've seen it before, I don't know what it does now.

93
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.910
You know what it does.

94
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.380
So is going to get rid or he's gonna stop the video for playing.

95
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.780
Since we are not longer in the screen.

96
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.190
Okay, great.

97
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.740
So now you're going to create the capture.

98
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.220
Feel it.

99
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.880
So before did we need to try to come away and.

100
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.500
We need this size box right in there as it gives space between this first test field and the capture

101
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.130
test field.

102
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.450
Okay.

103
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.690
For the sake of my strain.

104
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.510
Okay.

105
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.180
Hides of pain.

106
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.630
Okay.

107
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.540
And we can see tests filled.

108
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.130
Okay.

109
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.950
And the commission, as you know, imputes.

110
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.060
The Coalition.

111
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.150
Okay.

112
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.500
Then we can say --.

113
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.950
It says this is going to be what's.

114
00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.030
Cap shut and border weren't border at all.

115
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.670
Side line imputes border.

116
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.230
Okay.

117
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.730
Great.

118
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.850
You know, you know, you're not to get rid of the body, right?

119
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.240
Okay.

120
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.110
We don't.

121
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.770
You can do it.

122
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.290
Let me know.

123
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.730
Okay.

124
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.840
Now is country.

125
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.980
And this was before.

126
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.810
You need to take him away.

127
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.100
Okay.

128
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.050
Now let's check it out.

129
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.770
Okay.

130
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.700
And how the video and gallery and.

131
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.910
Okay.

132
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.050
We can just click on this.

133
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.330
You can see.

134
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.660
And we have the space.

135
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.960
Right.

136
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.490
Okay, great.

137
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.440
Now, the next thing is to have.

138
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.600
A button.

139
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.220
Okay to do that where we can as well have.

140
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.970
A sizeable US sized us.

141
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.050
So.

142
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.040
Sized box.

143
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.270
And hides of probably 15.

144
00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.950
Okay.

145
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.800
Now you're going to be using the bathroom, which you've probably seen before, known as an elevated,

146
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.420
elevated pathway and is going to take the press.

147
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.900
Okay.

148
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.380
And for the child, it's going to be any type of widget or you're going to use the test widget and.

149
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.880
Sorry.

150
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.110
Okay.

151
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.420
And we can say share.

152
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.110
A digital addiction can't ease control in this.

153
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.360
Okay.

154
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.950
This Mexican gallery again.

155
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.370
And.

156
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.510
Okay.

157
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.120
Okay.

158
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.200
You can see the view.

159
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.810
Now, all we can do is we can change the color.

160
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.750
Like, I'm just going to stop this.

161
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.650
We dance, distract you.

162
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.110
Okay.

163
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.550
We can change the color.

164
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.570
So, first of all, we can just see the coma and.

165
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.950
And over a year we can see a star and this is going to be elevated.

166
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.140
But then.

167
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.470
Sorry, elevated both in.

168
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.920
The it's sti from okay, we have the primary which has to do with the color of the background so we

169
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.400
can see colors start.

170
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.050
I think both should be okay.

171
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.570
But you can't just go with any color you need.

172
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.420
You can just go with any type of color all you need.

173
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.340
Right.

174
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.750
Okay.

175
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.520
Gray.

176
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.750
Great.

177
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.380
Okay.

178
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.240
Okay.

179
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:41.160
Now as well, you know, this test field of the property known as What's proof is right.

180
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.450
I think proof is icon.

181
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.070
So within this we can see a pretty face icon and this can be icons.

182
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.970
So it's gonna be on that call.

183
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.460
Widgets and icons.

184
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.900
That's music.

185
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.780
Music.

186
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.780
I think we have something like that music not okay.

187
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.500
Great.

188
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.230
So this is going to be on the left side.

189
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.880
You're going to see the shuttle and.

190
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.390
Over here as well.

191
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.370
We tend to ap decoration.

192
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.830
We can't see your face.

193
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.730
I can't.

194
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.560
It doesn't really matter if it comes first before this test instance, but it was just b which in the

195
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.370
decoration.

196
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:23.770
Okay.

197
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.470
So there's going to be a widget and there's going to be icons.

198
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:28.990
That's.

199
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:38.280
Let's see if we have any culture icon or probably we use the Cupertino who senior icon.

200
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.659
Cool party.

201
00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.230
No, I.

202
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.010
Cause.

203
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.000
Then let's see if we have the capture.

204
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.070
Sure.

205
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.720
Culture bubble.

206
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.640
I think it's going to look very cool.

207
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.610
Okay.

208
00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:57.940
Okay.

209
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.440
Now we can check this out.

210
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.040
Okay.

211
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.920
Okay.

212
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.910
And this.

213
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.440
Okay.

214
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.110
Great.

215
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.450
Okay.

216
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.430
Now all we can do is.

217
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.400
They said, Oh, this, we can't see if we have four.

218
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.520
So this is going to be Cooper scenario.

219
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.520
I cause.

220
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.770
That's music.

221
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.440
Music.

222
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.530
Mike Okay, let's see.

223
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.220
Okay.

224
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.700
Okay.

225
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.190
Okay.

226
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.480
Okay.

227
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.080
Okay.

228
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.650
Okay.

229
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.220
Okay.

230
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.850
Okay.

231
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.570
Okay.

232
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.460
I think that is not okay.

233
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.170
So there's going to be music not.

234
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.880
Okay.

235
00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.330
Okay.

236
00:09:59.330 --> 00:09:59.720
Okay.

237
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.110
Okay.

238
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.470
Okay.

239
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.830
Okay.

240
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.160
Okay.

241
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.640
Okay.

242
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:03.720
Okay.

243
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.380
Okay.

244
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.080

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.580
Okay.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.540
Okay.

249
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:10.990
Great.
