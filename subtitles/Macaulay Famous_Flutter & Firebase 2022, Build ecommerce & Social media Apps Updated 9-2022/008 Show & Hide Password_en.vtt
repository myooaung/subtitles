00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:11.690
And for sure, users can type in test or via typing test or via typing test over a year.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.270
But what we can do in this lecture is over here, we can have an icon.

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.810
And the reason for this icon is so that users can choose to make their password visible or not.

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.050
But before then, the test form field has a property known as of secure test default.

7
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.410
It is set to false and that is why you are able to see whatsoever you are typing in here.

8
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.170
But what we can do is we can change this to true.

9
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.880
Okay.

10
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.330
So by doing this, it's going to make this password or whatsoever is typed in here invisible.

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.280
Och och.

12
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.380
Now whatsoever we type in here is going to be invisible, but we can make this a bit more dynamic or

13
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.550
more professional.

14
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.930
So what we can do is over here, we can have an icon button.

15
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.060
And to do that, we send the inputs, the creation, the input.

16
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.640
The creation has a property known as Sophie's icon.

17
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.600
Surface icon, then the surface icon is going to be an icon widget.

18
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.460
But since we all agreed that we are going to make this icon clickable or we are going to click on the

19
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990
icon, we can go with something known as Icon Button.

20
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.270
The icon button has this on press, which is a function.

21
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.010
And it's as this icon as its property.

22
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.550
For the icon, it's going to be icon widgets.

23
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.440
And now we can say icons dot.

24
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.330
I think we have the V C be the.

25
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.760
Visibility.

26
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.400
Visibility of OC grades.

27
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620
And how did you come out in this country and then save?

28
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.990
You're going to see to via preface is this and suffice is over a previous mobile surface or via OC you

29
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.970
can see OC.

30
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.680
You can basically just change the colour whereby the icon widgets has this colour property so you can

31
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.580
change it towards whoever you desire.

32
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.150
But I think I'm okay with this.

33
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.450
Okay, so now what are we going to need to do is when we click on this, we want to be able to change

34
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.410
this to.

35
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.980
So what?

36
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.810
We want to be able to make this visible.

37
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.420
But to do this, what we can just do is we can create a variable via so we can create a bold variable.

38
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.010
That is, we are trying to say the type of variable is going to be a bull, which is a true or false

39
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.720
value.

40
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.770
So we can call this password.

41
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.870
We can just call this password.

42
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.310
Visible, we say, of the spear visible, and we are going to set it to true the fort.

43
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.400
True default.

44
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.870
Okay.

45
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.350
So what we can just do is instead of statically harden true to this test form field, where do we have

46
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.830
that?

47
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.190
Okay.

48
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.430
I think we have.

49
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.360
It's over here.

50
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.360
So instead of this, we can just say.

51
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.930
Password.

52
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.350
Visible.

53
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.770
Okay.

54
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.690
Sticking with the sentence since it is true.

55
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.890
So that is going to change, right?

56
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.450
Okay.

57
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.830
Nothing is going to change.

58
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.250
So what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to update this UI.

59
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.060
That is what is over here to make it visible.

60
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.370
And in that sort of there's the UI, we are going to be using something known as set state.

61
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.180
But unfortunately, the set state is not available in a stateless widget.

62
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.260
And you can see currently we are listed widgets.

63
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.040
So what we have to do is to migrate to a stateful widget in order for us, in order for us to have access

64
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:26.160
to that stateless widget property so alight and use control and dot then convert to stateful widgets.

65
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.040
Okay.

66
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.790
Great.

67
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.160
This country needs to save it.

68
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.030
Really need that.

69
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.760
Okay.

70
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.910
So now all we can do is.

71
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.120
Within this icon button, right?

72
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.260
We can then say set state.

73
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.250
Says States.

74
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.570
Says states.

75
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.620
And we're going to call this password visible.

76
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.340
Password visible and just want to type this.

77
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.130
Password visible.

78
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.840
And we can then say is equal to not password.

79
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.820
Visible.

80
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.790
Okay.

81
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:19.060
So what this would basically do is whenever if it is currently it is it is currently it is set to true

82
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.530
that it is visible.

83
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.840
So when we click on this, it's going to make it not visible and we click on it, it's going to make

84
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.460
it visible.

85
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.600
So is this is more like a switch to switch between visible and not visible?

86
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.500
Okay.

87
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.900
So this is basically if so, we can give this or to start.

88
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.410
Sorry.

89
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.140
Lastly, what we need to do is.

90
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.210
The icon button say, I think.

91
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.920
Over this, we can add the check and say password.

92
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.030
Visible if password visible is set to true.

93
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.970
If it is true.

94
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.240
We want to show this.

95
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.680
Right.

96
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.970
Else.

97
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.090
Who wants to say, I can't.

98
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.400
And it's going to be icons.

99
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.600
Dodds.

100
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.010
I think we have the.

101
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.030
So.

102
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.610
Okay.

103
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.830
There's going to be icons, dots.

104
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.780
We have something known as.

105
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.050
For some reason, I don't know what's wrong with my bicycle.

106
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.930
Okay, we can just copy.

107
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.280
And paste this copy and paste.

108
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.080
And I think we need additional additional cover.

109
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.000
And if it is true.

110
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.200
Therefore it is certainly true.

111
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:55.220
So we are going to have this icon right when we switch to force or we we make it invisible.

112
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.000
We are going to switch to the icon.

113
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.400
We say visibility on the score of.

114
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.090
Okay.

115
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.390
Hopefully we have that icon that's all surrounded.

116
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.810
I think I'm okay with of what we can do we can also start this.

117
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.410
Okay.

118
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.830
I'm just going to come back to this again.

119
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.030
I think I have a lot of heroes like.

120
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.310
Okay.

121
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.510
We just have to wait for this.

122
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.380
To finish.

123
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.950
Okay.

124
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.170
OC OC is going to start this tap and we can.

125
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.380
Try.

126
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.420
Okay for the password.

127
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.860
You can see the effort.

128
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.480
It is set to this visibility icon because it is set to true.

129
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.020
So what we can do, you can type in Arrow, you can see it is visible.

130
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.700
And now let's click on this.

131
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.180
Okay.

132
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.840
Click.

133
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.010
Okay.

134
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.270
Click on this.

135
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.020
Okay.

136
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.390
You can see since.

137
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.850
Good.

138
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:05.470
So what we are basically doing over here, we have this property known as of secure test default is

139
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.600
set to force.

140
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.930
And by setting it to force you, you're going to see everything you type in the value.

141
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:18.440
But what we did is over here we created a variable called password visible and we said it is a data

142
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.280
type of bool.

143
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.280
Both simply means a true or a force value.

144
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.330
Right.

145
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.560
And we use the variable over here.

146
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.460
If this is true, that is why we are able to see the password.

147
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.840
Right.

148
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.580
Then over here we have the icon button and we called that variable we created.

149
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.840
And what we simply do, we say not password visible.

150
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.460
So by doing this, this line of code, when is visible is going to make it not visible.

151
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.340
And when it not visible, it's going to make it visible.

152
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:55.600
And you can see it's going to update this to whatever value it says it has or it is.

153
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.190
Okay.

154
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.000
And over here we are simply checking if password visible is set to default, it is set to true.

155
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.800
So this is the code that is going to run else it if if it is set to if it is set to false.

156
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.750
We want to display this visibility on the score of.

157
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.350
Okay.

158
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.120
I fully understand.

159
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.960
Okay, guys.
