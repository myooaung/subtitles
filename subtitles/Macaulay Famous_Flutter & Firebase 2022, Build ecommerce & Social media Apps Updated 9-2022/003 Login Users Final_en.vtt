00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.760
In this lecture, we're going to create the login functionality.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.520
Now we're going to do this within the controller territory and then the host controller five and now

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.190
we can use controller and beat to make this right.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.550
And within the class that is the OTS controller class, we are going to create a new function.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.040
Okay.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.930
So over here we can just go ahead and specify it is a type of future.

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.549
And.

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.630
Strange.

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.280
And now we're going to call this function log in user users.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.750
Okay.

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.220
And within the parenthesis we are going to pass the fields we need and it's just going to be the email

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.300
and password.

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.660
And we can just go ahead and say it is a type of string email and it is a type of strange password.

16
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.870
Okay.

17
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.710
It's going to look very similar to that of this sign of users function.

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.420
You can basically just copy most of this stuff there.

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.070
Okay.

20
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.770
And over here, we can create a variable to store the possible error.

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.660
String.

22
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.740
RAZ And we can say some error occurred.

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.880
Okay.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.680
And now we can have a try at the cash block.

25
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.440
Try.

26
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.450
Try and catch.

27
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.110
And within the tribe, look, we can have some validation so we can say if email.

28
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.420
Email dots is not empty.

29
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.370
And the password.

30
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.250
Dart is not empty.

31
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.490
Sorry is not a picture.

32
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.060
It's not.

33
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.090
This is the one you're using.

34
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.170
And if it is not empty, then only we want to be able to log in the user.

35
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.419
And in order to do that, we're going to need the Firebase host.

36
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.070
And you can see we already have it over here.

37
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.490
We have a variable to save the value.

38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.510
Okay.

39
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.880
So we can then say on the score.

40
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.060
Arts.

41
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:34.560
And the sign in user with email, sign in user with email and password.

42
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.540
This is basically it.

43
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.270
And you can see we are passing the email and the password.

44
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.570
So over here we can have the semicolon.

45
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.170
This will take some time in order to log in the user or sign in the user so we can wait this.

46
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.320
And Via.

47
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.760
I was sorry.

48
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.100
Okay.

49
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.940
We need to use the async over here and that's easier.

50
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.490
It.

51
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.440
And here we can update the.

52
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.580
We can see as it's equal to success.

53
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.750
And for now we can also print something to ourself and say.

54
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.550
Log in.

55
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.200
So says Foley.

56
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.860
Okay.

57
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.320
Great.

58
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.550
Else if these fields are not filled in.

59
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.260
So you're going to have the heads of.

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.170
We want to update the rest variable.

61
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.870
To say, please.

62
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.930
Please.

63
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.610
Fields must not be empty.

64
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.240
And if the error is other from this probably network issue, we want to catch the error.

65
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.340
So you're going to need to say as is equal to e dot.

66
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.670
E to string.

67
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.720
And now over here we can then return.

68
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.110
Return address.

69
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.670
You can see now that hair has gone.

70
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.839
Okay, great.

71
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.350
Now you can see it looks similar to that of this.

72
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.070
For this, this is create a user with email and password.

73
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.870
So we're basically creating the user.

74
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.650
And you can see we are also updating the rest variable from this era according to sources, and we are

75
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.270
printing the user email to our democracy.

76
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.500
So and you can see it very similar to that of this.

77
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.990
Okay.

78
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.590
Now we can use control and to save this file and.

79
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.260
We then need to claw.

80
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.790
This function over here called login users.

81
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.010
So I'm going to go to my.

82
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.290
Customer login screen.

83
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:08.210
And really have the horse controller, I guess you already have the controller and restored the results

84
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.440
in a verbal code or the score controller.

85
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.730
Right.

86
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.340
Okay.

87
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.820
So we can just go ahead and create a function over here and let's make it more cleaner.

88
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.450
So you can call this log in users.

89
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.560
And we can then say on the scoreboards.

90
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.220
Ford's controller is going to be sorry.

91
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.270
Controller.

92
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.670
Now we have assets of the class and so we can have access to the login.

93
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.210
Uses OC now you can just I think I've already get rid of the phone controller, so we really do not

94
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.990
need that.

95
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.790
We do not need that full name.

96
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.030
We basically just need the email and the password to log in the user so you can get rid of that if you

97
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.380
still have it in yours.

98
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.130
And this is the controller and this is the password controller and you can see we are already bind it

99
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.610
to the field because we basically copy this code.

100
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.120
Right.

101
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.460
So you can see this is for the.

102
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.720
Email and we have the image controller.

103
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.090
So whatever value we're going to pass over here.

104
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.320
I'm going to pass in this email is going to be stored in this.

105
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.960
In this email controller available.

106
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.260
So currently we have f f stored over here and same as the password.

107
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.420
Whatever is going to be passed over here, it's going to be stored in this password controller.

108
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.350
Okay.

109
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:48.800
So remember in the we remember recently we created two variables called email and password and these

110
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.470
are the two variables.

111
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.720
So these are basically just variables.

112
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.400
We attach values.

113
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.120
You can see we did not say it's equal to something like this.

114
00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.780
Right?

115
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.460
We basically just created the variable without adding any value to it.

116
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:12.680
So since we have just called this login users function, it is expecting us to pass the two values to

117
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.070
it.

118
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.240
So for this.

119
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.680
This is going to be on the score.

120
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.690
Email controller.

121
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:28.520
Then the value of whatever the user is tapping in that should be the F and for the password.

122
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.770
This is going to be on the score password.

123
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.090
Controller.

124
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.390
Dodd says.

125
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.970
You can see this is one of the reasons we have to make this function private.

126
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.370
In the other fight, that is the.

127
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.620
London customer.

128
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.080
Screen.

129
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.860
If we get rid of this.

130
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.970
This on the score.

131
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.830
And over here, we're referring to the image controller.

132
00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:01.990
There is probability of referring to this on the score email instead of the one we have over there.

133
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.470
So you can see sometimes it's going to get we're going to have an error.

134
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:13.580
So that was why we have to make it on the score in order for this email to be unique to just this file.

135
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:22.130
So we are sure of this is the image controller we are referring to and not the other and the customer

136
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.570
screen.

137
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:33.380
And as well we can use the basic of it and the R rate in order to wait for the function because it is

138
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.700
a future.

139
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.169
Okay.

140
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.850
And now we can then call this function.

141
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:41.890
Okay.

142
00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.630
I think this should be it over here.

143
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.330
Okay.

144
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.290
And.

145
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.840
Log in.

146
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.030
Logan uses.

147
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.650
Okay.

148
00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.810
This country.

149
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.360
And new to the.

150
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.040
It puts.

151
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.980
Okay.

152
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.250
And now let's try.

153
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.140
I think I have a user called my colleague.

154
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.510
My colleague, Mark or Mark Poor?

155
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.590
Yeah.

156
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.690
I think I have something like that.

157
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.270
Mac.

158
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.630
Paul, it's Gmail.

159
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.830
That's com.

160
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.000
And the password is b E.J. y e c so you can click on login.

161
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.690
I guess something is going on here.

162
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.340
Okay.

163
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.900
We have successfully logged in.

164
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.690
Right.

165
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.490
Okay.

166
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.560
Now, what you're going to try to do now is this is your assignment.

167
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:56.870
You are going to create a new screen called customer on screen, then email the user logs in.

168
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.900
You're going to take the user to that customer.

169
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.950
On screen.

170
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.650
Okay.

171
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.150
That's what you're going to do then.

172
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.820
I not to do this.

173
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.310
I'm going to give you some little tips and how to do that.

174
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.230
It's going to be similar to which you have over here.

175
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.090
You can see over here.

176
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:21.750
We are basically saying sign up uses function rights and we are setting the stage for this load of spin.

177
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.120
So they will click on the signup button.

178
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:30.840
If the field is filled field and we're going to start this loader spinner and we are going to create

179
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:37.200
the user with the email password and we're going to set stage in order to stop the load spinner after

180
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.600
the account must have been created.

181
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.690
Or if there is any error, we are going to stop the loader spinner.

182
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:49.650
And over here we are basically checking if rest is equal to success is not equal to such a success.

183
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.440
If it is not equal to success, it means there is an error.

184
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.450
And we basically want to.

185
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.410
Show that user the error.

186
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:04.570
Else it means the account was successfully created and we want to navigate to the home screen.

187
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.390
But what we're going to do is we're not going to navigate to the home screen.

188
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.760
Now let's have a more security check.

189
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.460
We are going to navigate to the.

190
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.860
Login screen for the user to.

191
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.240
Login is for our accounts.

192
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.670
So we call this customer log in screen.

193
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.520
Okay, great.

194
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.760
So what you're going to do?

195
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:32.600
You're going to do something similar to this, but instead of log in to the okay, you're going to do

196
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.520
something similar to this and you're going to log in the user to the home screen.

197
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:44.960
So what you have to do is within the views you're going to need to create a new file which you're going

198
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.270
to call customer.

199
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.140
On the score home on the score screen.

200
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:58.260
So you're going to take the user to the screen for the now we can just go with the set list.

201
00:11:59.070 --> 00:11:59.880
With that.

202
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.460
Customer.

203
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.970
Home screen.

204
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.930
So take the user to the screen.

205
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.020
I'm just going to use control dots.

206
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.590
Alights and reports the material to that package so you can take the user to the screen.

207
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:23.010
So do this yourself and see if you can also had the loaded spinner to this.

208
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.160
Okay, this is your assignment.

209
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:25.760
Okay?

210
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.220
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
