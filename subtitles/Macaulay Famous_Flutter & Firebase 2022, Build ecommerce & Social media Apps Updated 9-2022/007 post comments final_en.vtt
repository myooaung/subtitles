00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.950
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome in this lecture, regional test.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.960
What we did in the last lecture.

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.320
Okay, so now I'm going to go to my Android app and I will comment on this video.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.550
So I'm going to click on comment.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.310
And you can see we have this area, but we can basically just go ahead and drop a comment so we can

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.480
say very.

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.650
Very cool.

9
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.840
Okay, click on send.

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.160
Okay.

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.540
And go check our conference store and videos.

12
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.960
Okay.

13
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.990
Like I told you, the comment collection is going to be created and is going to be connected to this.

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.030
Videos collection.

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.270
Right.

16
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.510
Okay.

17
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.550
I think we do not have it yet.

18
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.680
Q I'm just going to make sure.

19
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.200
I did this again.

20
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.110
Hopefully we have new eras.

21
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.540
Okay.

22
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.200
All we can do is we can go to these and then go to the data.

23
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.690
In order to automatically refresh.

24
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.240
This account.

25
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.990
You can see we have this over here.

26
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.840
And you can see we did have the comments collection right away.

27
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.760
So you can see this is what we were basically trying to do when we said the dark dots collection again.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.680
Then we have the comments collection.

29
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.730
So you can see these comments.

30
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.500
Collection is connected to this video's collection based on this.

31
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.460
Okay.

32
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.350
Now we can go into the comments collection.

33
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.150
And you can see again, each comment is going to be connected with something as well.

34
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.600
No.

35
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.670
It's known as Heidi or Heidi.

36
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.680
Okay.

37
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.180
You can see what we're basically trying to do in the last lecture.

38
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.360
Just show you this again, a comment.

39
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.130
Comment.

40
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.220
The key.

41
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.080
And.

42
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.050
So we come in and.

43
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.730
Okay, Hunter and be.

44
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.080
Okay.

45
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.170
You can see it over here.

46
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.650
First of all, over here we are split gets in how many comments we have.

47
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.340
And we are basically getting the legs right.

48
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.970
Okay.

49
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
And that's why you were to see zero.

50
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.450
You can see we have I think I've done this before.

51
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.670
So the first comment is going to be zero.

52
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.350
And the second is going to be one.

53
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.340
And so on and so forth.

54
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.190
Now we just have two comments, right?

55
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.080
That is what we have of our business that gets in the lens of the comments and the way we said.

56
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.470
Who wants to look sorry, not dare.

57
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.510
Like over here.

58
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.080
Right.

59
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.500
Okay.

60
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.760
We said we want to go to the evidence collection.

61
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.120
Right.

62
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.370
Since the video's collection already exists.

63
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.870
So is this going to go into it?

64
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.930
And once the content is coming out with the.

65
00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.540
Land of many lands we have for I'm in the videos we have, so that's why we are posting this post I.D.

66
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.210
You can see over here in the comment screen.

67
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.430
We have to post it over here.

68
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.810
Right.

69
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.450
We have the ideal buyer, right?

70
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.210
And we pass it onto the constructor.

71
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.970
There is a we'll pass it on to the constructor.

72
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.280
So anyway, we call this command screen.

73
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.500
Revenue needs to pass in the value.

74
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.040
Okay.

75
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.980
You can see over here the video screen.

76
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.650
We have the commercial screen of our year.

77
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.740
If you come in screen.

78
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.470
Okay.

79
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.800
Comment screen, a comment screen, and now we are passing the value to it.

80
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.770
And we said the value to it is going to be the data, the length of the video that is in the video we

81
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.070
have.

82
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.030
And you can see we are doing it away.

83
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.300
Okay.

84
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.010
Upload video.

85
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.300
You can see over here we as well, we got the lens of the video.

86
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.410
Right.

87
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.230
We said behind this is going to be the light of the video.

88
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.990
So that's what we're basically doing or fully understand.

89
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.730
Okay.

90
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.510
But if you just look back and watch the lectures, it beats.

91
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.390
Now the photographs you can see now is comment is connected to this.

92
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.370
Again, this is the first comment I made.

93
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.510
Okay.

94
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.010
I think I did it twice.

95
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.459
Okay.

96
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.250
Very, very cool.

97
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.530
And we can as well say very.

98
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.650
Okay.

99
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.090
We're going to see quite bad video.

100
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.620
Video are you going to see their.

101
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.950
Okay.

102
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.450
What we can do is we can go to this and come back to this.

103
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.040
Okay.

104
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.750
Videos.

105
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.450
And you can see we have comments collection.

106
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.320
And as well, we did have the two.

107
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.490
And check it out.

108
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.570
You can see by the video and automatically we have the date published.

109
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.990
You can see is June eight, 2022.

110
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.300
I'm currently recording this video engine eight.

111
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.140
That is today.

112
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.090
Okay.

113
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.970
And the ID is comments two and the likes is zero.

114
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.720
Profile photo of the user.

115
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.070
You can basically just open this in the new tab and see the idea of the user and the user.

116
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.990
Name me at the end of the car.

117
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.410
Okay.

118
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.690
Now what we can do to get rid of this era?

119
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.250
The reason for this era is because we wrote the comment screen.

120
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.220
We arrived to this view with something not as obvious, and because of this, it does not longer know

121
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.930
how many lengths we have.

122
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:45.970
Okay, now to do this, we need to give the length of how many comments we have in.

123
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.910
The database.

124
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.050
Okay, so now all we have to do is we have to use this, which should send before, like over the command

125
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.620
controller.

126
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.420
We need to have access to this, this variable value.

127
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.940
So how many comments we have in the database?

128
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.300
Okay.

129
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.270
But the problem is currently this is a private function, sorry is a private variable.

130
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.160
So because of that we cannot have access to this variable outside this class.

131
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.470
So all we can do is use this.

132
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.520
We should send before.

133
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.910
Okay.

134
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.100
So we can basically just copy this.

135
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.940
Right.

136
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.750
And.

137
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.140
His is over a year, he said of the video.

138
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.340
So.

139
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.900
Instead of the video models.

140
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.570
This is going to be from the comment models.

141
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.160
And we can call this.

142
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.830
Comments list.

143
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.340
Right.

144
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.850
And this.

145
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.560
Okay, great.

146
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.440
Okay.

147
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.670
Now, over here.

148
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.830
So the command screen.

149
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.830
Hopefully in the start of this.

150
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.780
But if you don't, you can also let me know.

151
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.140
So I'm going to try my best to make a video that's explained a bit more to you.

152
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.250
Okay, so now we can then call that comment controller.

153
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:11.090
Controller and we can then say dot com at least then dot length.

154
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.200
Okay, great.

155
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.670
Now we know we are no longer going to have any error is going to go off.

156
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.390
Okay, great.

157
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.680
Okay.

158
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.610
Now, the issue now is to display those comments.

159
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.720
You can see currently we have the comments in the database.

160
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.080
Right.

161
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.970
And we have two comments.

162
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.420
Okay.

163
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.680
And over here.

164
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.750
We are basically saying we have to convert, right.

165
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.080
We are basically gets in the comments we have in our database.

166
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.430
Right.

167
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.650
Okay.

168
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.370
This is cleared.

169
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.180
Okay.

170
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.130
Now the next thing you're going to need to try to do is to try to display the comments.

171
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.520
Okay.

172
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.200
So try to do this yourself.

173
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.040
Then in the next lecture, we are going to do this together.

174
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.240
Okay, guys, see you in the next step.
