00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.350
I guys work.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.740
In this lecture, we're going to create the castle model.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.510
Okay, now, over this model star tree, we are going to create a new PHI.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.450
And we are going to call this fi cut afterwards where we can just see cuts on this car, a city arrow

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.820
that is pictured Dodge Dart.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.890
And know they're going to need to create a class and as well they're going to call this.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.290
Katz, 80.

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.890
Arrow.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.930
Okay, now, the first field we need is going to be the height of the products.

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.790
So you can say find a sister that says it is a type of string.

11
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.720
Nidhi.

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.670
Okay.

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.370
The order we need is the name of the product.

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.020
So this going to be fine?

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.360
We can just call this tie to.

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.970
Right.

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.350
And detailed we need is the quantity of the product.

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.450
That's how many products we have available.

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630
So it is going to be finer.

20
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.080
And.

21
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.530
String Quartet.

22
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.910
T.

23
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.130
Hopefully I can spell.

24
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.060
Okay.

25
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.210
The other field we need we're just going to need to add is so we call on the other field we need is

26
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.560
the price or the product and the image of the product is going to be finer.

27
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.040
It's going to be a type of double sense.

28
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.150
It's going to take the test war symbol.

29
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.580
Okay, we can call this price and finally find a string.

30
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.010
Image.

31
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.360
Yarrow okay.

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.400
Right.

33
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.760
It was Earl tied to it.

34
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.390
Okay.

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.310
Now the next thing to do is to pass it on to the constructor.

36
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.170
Now, for us in our life, what you can just do is to highlight this and use control and dots like Windows

37
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.270
to create a constructor for right now Fields.

38
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.540
Okay, now we're going to make this a named constructor.

39
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.970
So to do that, we had this.

40
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.360
In over a year.

41
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.910
This as well.

42
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.560
And then we can make this not required by hard then this.

43
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.270
Right.

44
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100
Well, we actually need this to be required.

45
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.860
So what we're going to do is we can see.

46
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.520
Required.

47
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.000
Required.

48
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.190
Required.

49
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.470
And.

50
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.700
Required.

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.570
Okay.

52
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.020
Great.

53
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.670
And now.

54
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.570
Okay as well.

55
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.910
We need to acquire this.

56
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.680
Quiet.

57
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.850
And then we can use culture and save.

58
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.650
Okay.

59
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.190
Great.

60
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.160
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
