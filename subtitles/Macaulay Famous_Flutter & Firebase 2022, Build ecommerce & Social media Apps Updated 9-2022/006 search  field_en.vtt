00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.500
In this lecture, we're going to create this edge field.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.280
Okay not to do this, but I need to go back to our vesicles.

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.400
Now over this widget, you're going to create a new fly and we're going to codify search on this call

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.510
in fields.

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.240
Then the section which is the that.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.040
Now we're going to use culture and beat to make this right.

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.440
And then we can use this the less we get.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.040
Okay.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.650
We can also call this search if it's okay over here.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.420
We're going to need to highlight then use controller and does not support the material that that package.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.840
Okay.

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.570
Now over here, you can see we have two widgets.

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.400
That is the test field and this filter icon.

16
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.370
Both are being displayed horizontally.

17
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.420
That is from left to right.

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.690
So for this reason, what's a role widget?

19
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.860
Okay.

20
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.070
For the child is going to be what's appropriate.

21
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.860
Now, this rule can take in multiple widgets.

22
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.570
It asks this to do it.

23
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.150
Okay.

24
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.230
Now for the first child is going to be a test field.

25
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.280
But what you can do before then we can use if this was because we want the test field to fill the available

26
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.790
space.

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.310
Okay.

28
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.240
For the child.

29
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.470
He's going to be a text.

30
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.870
Field.

31
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.250
Take.

32
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.840
Okay.

33
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.830
Okay.

34
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.420
Now we can give you flex.

35
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.630
So.

36
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.720
If flecks of white oak.

37
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.290
Now how to treat a.

38
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.740
Right.

39
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.180
Okay.

40
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.340
Now, the first thing you're going to have in this test shield is something known as decoration.

41
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.770
And this is going to be box decoration.

42
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.290
Right.

43
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.030
Sorry.

44
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.979
Not books the creation but imputes.

45
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.780
If it's decoration.

46
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.520
Okay, great.

47
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.050
Now what we can do is we can sell a few caller to call us.

48
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.280
That's white.

49
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.510
That's Wanda Chesterfield, TV of Color of White.

50
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.910
Or we can just leave it at red for now.

51
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.120
They're both going to set the field to.

52
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.520
True.

53
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.430
This is going to give some greenish color.

54
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.020
Okay.

55
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.430
Now what's we can do?

56
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.220
Well, first of all, they just want these contribute anesthesia first, then use control B to make

57
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.820
this well.

58
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.520
Then they're going to go to the home screen, then where they're going to have positive air.

59
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.340
So that is the switch.

60
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.290
Right.

61
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.670
Okay.

62
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.770
So this is the way that can a digital coma control this to save?

63
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.780
Good shape.

64
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.040
You do it and it's in the Earth's.

65
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.510
Okay.

66
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.620
They can see this, right?

67
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.060
Okay.

68
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.640
Now what you can do is you can see that it has filled the available space.

69
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.090
Right, because of this level, which are reason to wrap it up.

70
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.020
Okay.

71
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.580
Now we will continue for we will stop.

72
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.780
Okay.

73
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.030
Now the most in we are going to have is the border.

74
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.530
We're going to say better than this is going to be hard line of line if border.

75
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.730
Okay.

76
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.170
Now what we can as well do this.

77
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.950
We can make it a bit crowded so you can see a border with us.

78
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.370
Whether we use that circular, that circle of shifts in the K with labor check it out to see what it

79
00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.790
does.

80
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.700
Okay.

81
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.270
Great.

82
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.290
They can see the weather.

83
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.050
The train, the coma.

84
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.770
Right.

85
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.910
Okay.

86
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.900
Now we can get rid of the body.

87
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.320
Right.

88
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.010
To do that.

89
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:22.330
Oh, we just have to do is we tend to align if it were to be just going to sit by the side is going

90
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.240
to vote the side that not.

91
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.770
Okay.

92
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.330
Go check it out and see what it does.

93
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.460
Okay.

94
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.320
You can see does get rid of the border.

95
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.520
Okay.

96
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.120
Great.

97
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.410
Now what we can do is we can have the earnings test, which is more like the place or the sorry outside

98
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.550
the line.

99
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.100
If you've order within the declaration because of the interest, which is more like the place order

100
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.930
in your estate though.

101
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.540
So this is just going to say search.

102
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.520
Search for products.

103
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:11.700
Right so you can it in today you want to we can give this side to this plays into its into tie so for

104
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.610
this tied is going to be a tie so he's going to be test.

105
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.740
This tie.

106
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.020
They could just give you a color to call a loss of career.

107
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.440
Okay.

108
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.330
I'm trying to save in.

109
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.100
Go check this out to see what it does.

110
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.750
Okay.

111
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.680
You can see to where.

112
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.960
Now, what you can do is you can add an icon, right?

113
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.600
So you say, how did you cover?

114
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.210
We turned it into decoration.

115
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.350
You can have.

116
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.510
And they co-writes.

117
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.880
So I would just have to say is.

118
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.340
Preface.

119
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.210
So within in the future crucial because the proof is icon that you can just use a container so able

120
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.010
to have access to the port in the okay so for the child is going to be icon.

121
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.440
Echo Jets is going to be.

122
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.160
So it is.

123
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.210
And they used to try to be immediate assets.

124
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.570
Image that assets.

125
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.330
The key assets are the location.

126
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.110
So.

127
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.740
Okay.

128
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.120
Yeah.

129
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.180
So they can see we have these assets, right.

130
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.370
Assets then.

131
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.100
Icons.

132
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.260
Right.

133
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.660
Okay.

134
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.290
Down, down.

135
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.890
Filter.

136
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.880
Okay.

137
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.980
So there's going to be assets slash icons.

138
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.200
This lush filter.

139
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.700
Right.

140
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.770
I think the name is.

141
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.890
He'll hopefully then make mistakes.

142
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.590
Really mistake future thoughts.

143
00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.860
That changes.

144
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.600
Okay.

145
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.050
That is going to be very big.

146
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.520
So we can give you a size to this.

147
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.190
So with 15, I think we need some additions.

148
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.150
Okay.

149
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.170
I'm trying to save.

150
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.100
Right and go check it out.

151
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.030
Okay.

152
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.810
Great.

153
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.230
So that should not be theater.

154
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.680
But.

155
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.750
Situates.

156
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.180
Okay.

157
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.410
I try this to save.

158
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.910
Okay, great.

159
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.810
Now we can give you a pardon for this.

160
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.690
You can see that was the reason for this container.

161
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.600
So the other side is the part that is an edge and sets.

162
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.530
That's all.

163
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.520
You can't just give a pardon of 50.

164
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.170
Right.

165
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.550
Okay.

166
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.020
You had enough to do.

167
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.240
It's inside, right?

168
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.830
So there's going to be kids.

169
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.160
It's.

170
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.850
It's similar.

171
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.960
Okay, great.

172
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.880
Great.

173
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.270
Right.

174
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.660
Okay.

175
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.900
Now what you can do.

176
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.620
You can give some bits of space between those edges.

177
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.320
Not to do that, but we just have to.

178
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:14.800
Okay.

179
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.350
Well, there.

180
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.700
Maybe they have a part in that just goes to the head and sets.

181
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.080
That's all of maybe 24 now.

182
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.010
Okay, use caution.

183
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.670
This is TV.

184
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.360
Check it out.

185
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.030
Okay.

186
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.590
Great.

187
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.309
Right.

188
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:34.960
Okay.

189
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.080
So we can get rid of this red and just use white.

190
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.740
Hopefully we can't see this.

191
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:44.960
Okay.

192
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.530
Great.

193
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.270
I think it's too.

194
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.780
It's in, right.

195
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.220
Okay.

196
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.400
Grids.

197
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.190
Okay.

198
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.840
Okay, guys.

199
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.730
See you in the next lecture.
