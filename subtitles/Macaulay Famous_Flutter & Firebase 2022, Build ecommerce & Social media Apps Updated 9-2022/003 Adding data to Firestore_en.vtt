00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.270
Now, this lecture had awarded us to the faster database.

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.830
Okay, now, to do this, we're going to go to our visa code.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.230
Then we're going to go to the controllers for the dead.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.000
The hearts of the controller.

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.480
Okay.

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.060
Now, what I'm going to do first is really is control and be enough to make this very big.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.620
Okay, great.

10
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.540
Now, over here, we are simply saying if the who name the user, name the email, the password, if

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
they are not empty, then only serve for that.

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
If they are not empty, then only we want to create the user.

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.930
Okay, now over here we create an invisible called create.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.980
Right.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.830
Which has access to all the details of that user.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.240
Okay.

17
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.170
Now, what we are also going to do is we don't only just want to create the user, but as well we are

18
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.290
going to save that user to the faster database.

19
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.290
Now we can easily just after a year we can.

20
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.610
We can still fire this fire.

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.830
So we shall show you before Families First, that is, does that coalition.

22
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.290
Right.

23
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.360
So what are we going to do?

24
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.010
We can just see if that's where we as fast or in the variable circle go to our our cost.

25
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.410
The dodge by that I'm gonna use control and V to make this white.

26
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.570
And over here, we can create a variable.

27
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.620
And we can call this.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.790
Player base store.

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.570
Okay, then this is going to be required to firebase for us to.

30
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.640
For us to do that is tense.

31
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.410
Okay, great.

32
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.830
Now you're going to go back to the site of.

33
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.080
The sound of.

34
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.330
Okay.

35
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.130
So the arts curricula.

36
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.530
Okay.

37
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.150
Like we said, we don't only want to create these, but as well what are we are going to save all this

38
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.860
data is to the.

39
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.250
Class two database.

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.860
Okay, great.

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.180
Now, what you're going to do now is to call that the variable we created.

42
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.860
Okay, so it's going to be five days.

43
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.790
So.

44
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.050
Then they're going to set dot collection.

45
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240
Now, I just showed you this on.

46
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.940
I guess you do an example of you write when you created a collection.

47
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.670
So like I said, we're not going to create this collection manually.

48
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.630
Okay.

49
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.200
So this is going to be we're going to call this collection uses.

50
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.620
Okay.

51
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:59.650
Now, the next thing we did after creating the user's collection, which was to connect that user with

52
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.280
an idea.

53
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.850
Right.

54
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.050
So as well, what we're going to do is not to get the.

55
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.170
Idea of.

56
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.370
Now to get the idea of the user, you're going to say dot.

57
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.660
The dog I know as well told you dog is referring to the user.

58
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.320
Okay.

59
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.160
So now to get the idea of the user, what they're going to do is this very concrete they're going to

60
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.730
secrete.

61
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.300
That's.

62
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.350
Create the user standards you ID.

63
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.600
So this is going to give us the idea of the user.

64
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.000
We can just love to see it come in.

65
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.570
Okay.

66
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.780
So now over here we have created.

67
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.960
A coalition called Uses.

68
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.480
Then we said Doc, which is referring to the user.

69
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.000
That is a single user that I said you to connect that.

70
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.500
User to the coalition using words.

71
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.580
And Heidi, so over here we got the idea of the user base into the variable could create this rainbow

72
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.140
called create as access to all the users data.

73
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.520
Right.

74
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.360
Okay.

75
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.810
So they are creating it.

76
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.220
They're giving the recreating the idea based on the.

77
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.140
Right.

78
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.540
Okay.

79
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.540
So now what they're going to do it is they're going to set those set.

80
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.350
Okay.

81
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.710
Great.

82
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.020
Okay.

83
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.520
Now, so what you're going to do is to pass all those fields the first.

84
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.040
Fields.

85
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.850
Vineyard is the full name.

86
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.030
Just make it like this.

87
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.840
Okay.

88
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.290
So this is going to be full on the second name, right?

89
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.370
Sorry.

90
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.330
This should be comma.

91
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.150
We also need to use a name.

92
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.840
Okay.

93
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.160
So it is going to be.

94
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.190
Use a name.

95
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.580
Right.

96
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.030
Okay.

97
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.700
We also need to email.

98
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.520
And this is going to be.

99
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.470
In their eyes.

100
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.870
Okay.

101
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.190
I think these are the two fields we need.

102
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.040
We can't actually store the password.

103
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.840
Okay, great.

104
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.300
Great.

105
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.140
Now, currently we don't have the users coalition rights.

106
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.810
What automatically is going to get created when we around us?

107
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.250
Okay, great.

108
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.990
So what you're basically saying if all these fields are not empty, we want to create these.

109
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.740
We don't want to create the user also wants to store the data's in or it's faster.

110
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.180
Okay.

111
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.110
Great.

112
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.660
So now we're going to try this out well before then in our target in order to avoid areas such as the

113
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.080
heart.

114
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.470
For now, we're just going to get rid of this place that will crush our heart because we have a ton

115
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.160
of that.

116
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.150
Okay, so what you can just do over this task, you can just convert.

117
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.240
This image, though.

118
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.730
You see it later in comments.

119
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.150
Okay.

120
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.780
Great.

121
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.910
Artsy start this.

122
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.330
Okay.

123
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.300
Or to start.

124
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.910
Ack ack ack ack ack ack.

125
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.940
I think this has taken longer than expected.

126
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.330
Okay.

127
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.630
Sorry for the delay.

128
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.710
Okay.

129
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.140
Now you're going to.

130
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.690
Okay.

131
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.690
I think we need to go to this side up.

132
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.590
All right.

133
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.850
Currently, we don't have that.

134
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.850
Okay, now for the phone.

135
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.850
We can.

136
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.310
We can we can sell.

137
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.250
I think a lot of the problem.

138
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.860
Okay.

139
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.720
So on.

140
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.450
There we can see Macaulay.

141
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.710
Luckily she was okay.

142
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.680
So the email is going to be sorry.

143
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.290
The user name is going to be my call.

144
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.090
Lay in wait is going to be called the.

145
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.760
It was.

146
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.970
She will come.

147
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.160
Then the password is going to be a Y and AC.

148
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.650
Okay.

149
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.370
Now we're going to click on words.

150
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.150
Register now as of see what is going on.

151
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.130
We can just go to our.

152
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.800
So.

153
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.410
I mean, are.

154
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.730
Then the book also.

155
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.220
Okay.

156
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.760
Great.

157
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.110
It's created the college campus.

158
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.510
Okay.

159
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.050
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to check our way.

160
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.030
Just going to go to this ruse.

161
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.010
Then navigate, get back to DHS automatically to refresh that page.

162
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.550
Okay.

163
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.830
Now you can see we are the users collection.

164
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.820
Okay, great.

165
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.450
We have our users coalition now in how to connect this user to this.

166
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.210
Users.

167
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:13.380
We are using the height we we created an ID and the user's ID to connect this user to the user's condition.

168
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:13.780
Okay.

169
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.970
So this is the connection between.

170
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:16.870
Okay.

171
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.910
I don't really know if you can understand this, but I believe as the process goes, you didn't understand

172
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.440
everything works.

173
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:23.830
Okay?

174
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.590
So what we can do as well, we can't just create another user because it should be.

175
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.070
I mean.

176
00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.740
And this should be.

177
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.720
I mean.

178
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:51.980
Then this should be the main -- that called it the password us, B.J. Mark.

179
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.570
Okay, you can click on register again and go check what is happening here.

180
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.090
I think we're having some.

181
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.280
The Turkish is a small network.

182
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.000
Okay.

183
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.490
Great.

184
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.350
You can see it over here.

185
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.960
I mean, which means we have created that user.

186
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.420
Okay, now you can see it over here.

187
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.240
Now we have some documents.

188
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.260
So you can see we have two documents or we have words.

189
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.280
So users.

190
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.350
So you can refer to this to.

191
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.200
This too.

192
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.340
It is a way to document or to use, as the rabbi said.

193
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.220
But users of both documents are connected.

194
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.070
So this use escalation by words and it.

195
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.170
Okay, great.

196
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.780
So now you're going to start now.

197
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.630
Savor the image as well to our database.

198
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.060
Right.

199
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.590
Okay.

200
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.120
But for now, I think they're just going to start over here.

201
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.300
So you can check the process.

202
00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.530
It's not really that much.

203
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.260
Right.

204
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:08.590
We are basically saying if other cities are not empty wants to create the user then attractive to the

205
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.010
user.

206
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.010
We want to store the data as to the first store.

207
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.760
So that is always going to say, okay, we stored the variable, stored the created users values in

208
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.780
the original called Create, which also has the height of the user.

209
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.740
And over you said doc, which is referring to the user to create its user.

210
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.500
That's your idea.

211
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.520
We should get the user.

212
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.290
You are the user, Heidi, for us.

213
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:38.230
The recognition needs to this user, just as you said, you can see this is more like a rules or then

214
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.590
both.

215
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:44.020
Together you can see the connection on this area over here and this are all connected both together.

216
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:44.440
Okay.

217
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.230
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
