Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.140
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.150
In this lecture, we're going to have the content for each tab.

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.810
Okay.

5
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.550
Now, in order to do this, we have to go back to our via code and we send the scaffold.

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.910
The scaffold has a property which you've said before, known as body.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.070
For the body.

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.710
It's going to be this wish you've not seen before.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.660
It is known as Tab.

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.350
Tab.

11
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.800
Bar beer.

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.810
This tab bar view can take multiple tabs widgets so it has sorry can multiple tabs content so it has

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:53.490
this children property and what we can do we can then have the first tab content that is the content

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.740
for this first step and we can easily just have a center widget for now center.

15
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.180
Child.

16
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.830
Sorry.

17
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.210
He is going to break this and center.

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.240
Right and child test.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.630
We can't say, man.

20
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.790
Category.

21
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.110
Okay.

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.210
How did she come over there?

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.520
And we can copy this.

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.960
To read more.

25
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.150
Copy and paste this.

26
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.820
Okay.

27
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.170
We need another case controller and s save.

28
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.940
And this should be women and this should be worth keeps issues.

29
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.380
Kids.

30
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.930
And shoes.

31
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.440
How do you train a car in this country?

32
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.250
So I think I'm getting used to hard commerce.

33
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.520
Okay.

34
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.400
And this is it.

35
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.440
We are currently in the women top and this is the top content for this.

36
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.540
And kids can see and shoes and men seems good, right?

37
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.750
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
