00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.330
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.180
Welcome.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lecture, we're going to solve a bug.

4
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.800
Okay, now I'm going to show you this box.

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.480
They want me to show you this bug.

6
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.880
We need to go to our control as their tree.

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.410
And then the upload on this car product, on this car controllers.

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.170
And now we can use Concha and Beets to make this white.

9
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.880
Okay, now you can see over here we created a function card upload image to storage and we are simply

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.110
uploading the image to this storage top over.

11
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.420
Yeah.

12
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.870
Okay.

13
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:42.170
And over here we created a folder and we call this the product and we said the name of the uploaded

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.980
image is going to be the current logged in user ID and this is where the problem is, right?

15
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.340
Okay.

16
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.460
Now whenever a user creates an account, a unit is automatically generated for that user, right?

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.690
A user ID is automatically going to be generated for that user.

18
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.020
Right.

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.610
And we are simply saying.

20
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.330
That's it.

21
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.680
It's going to be in there is going to be the name of the uploaded product.

22
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.470
Hi.

23
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.980
Okay.

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.680
And now this is where the error is.

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.030
Like I said, now, whenever we upload a new product, the name of that file is still going to be the

26
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.370
same because it is not the same user who is uploading that product.

27
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.030
So the current logged in guys, your ID is taking them to the same for all the products that specific

28
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.650
user is uploaded.

29
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.230
That is why is going to keep updating that image since the name of the fight is going to be the same

30
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.120
and Firebase is not going to know if that image is a new word or not.

31
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.580
So these are the fi are still going to be the current logged in UI user I.D..

32
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.030
Okay.

33
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.340
Now, does this solve this bug?

34
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.340
What we have to do is to make this unique.

35
00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.240
So whenever we upload a new image is automatically going to generate a unique uid for us.

36
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.750
Okay.

37
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.130
Now to do this, all we just have to do is we can simply copy this culture and see and paste this within

38
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.060
the async.

39
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.250
And over here we can copy.

40
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.800
And instead of using this current logged in user ID as the name of the file, we can use this.

41
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.790
Okay.

42
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.420
So whenever we upload a new product is automatically going to generate a unique number as the name of

43
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.990
the file.

44
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.440
Okay.

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.850
Now what we can do is we can hot restart this and while export restarts in, we can get rid of this

46
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.790
paradox collection and just had a new word.

47
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.120
Okay.

48
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.430
Did it?

49
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.040
Collection and products.

50
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.510
Okay.

51
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.140
Delete.

52
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.490
Okay.

53
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.940
Okay.

54
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.410
Okay.

55
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.870
Okay.

56
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.040
Okay, great.

57
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.720
Now, let's try to upload a new product back over here.

58
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.720
Okay.

59
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.040
Gallery and Gucci.

60
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.870
I think she's very cast.

61
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.460
Okay.

62
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.730
Gucci and citizens.

63
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.910
Ready?

64
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.260
Cause we can just see one person, and the category is claws.

65
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.460
And we can just see a best selling.

66
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.760
And this is very cars.

67
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.390
We just have one of this product and now we can upload.

68
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.650
Okay, now let's go check our seminar to see if anything is going on there.

69
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.070
Like you can see, I think is Dawn and we can basically go to this and go back to this to see if we

70
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.790
have that product.

71
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.950
You can see we have this product.

72
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.630
Okay.

73
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.710
Now let's try it.

74
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.340
So you can see is automatically as well generating towards a unique ID for us because we have this.

75
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.970
Over.

76
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.330
Yeah.

77
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.410
Okay.

78
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.860
If you've forgotten what this EU ID does, you can basically just go back to that lecture.

79
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.030
Okay.

80
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.780
As well.

81
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.920
We can't try to.

82
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.670
Okay.

83
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.070
Applaud in your word is going to do it from here and there's going to be this.

84
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.550
And instead of Gucci, we can't say jackets.

85
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:20.010
And jacket is not really that cause we can't just say $50 and as well clothes will sell best selling

86
00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.209
jacket.

87
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.200
And so this is very cheap.

88
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.010
We have five of this.

89
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.030
We can applaud.

90
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.250
Okay.

91
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.740
Go to this and check it.

92
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.760
Okay.

93
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.630
Okay.

94
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.470
Now on.

95
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.790
Okay.

96
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.600
I think.

97
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.620
Okay, you can see.

98
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.900
Let's check if the image is the same thing.

99
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.280
Okay.

100
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.910
You can see the image is not there, Fred.

101
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.660
Before what we are simply doing is we are using the current logged in user ID as the name of the PHI.

102
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.970
Right.

103
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.570
And this is the name of the Phi.

104
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.470
Whenever we upload a new product that's current, look, the new Yazidi does not change for that user

105
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.060
is still going to be the name of that PHI as is is still the name of that Phi.

106
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.910
What I is going to think of, I basically noting that image is still the same since this is the same

107
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.210
name.

108
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.840
Okay.

109
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.160
But not currently.

110
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.850
We are using the UID package to generate a unique ID whenever we automatically whenever we will not

111
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.450
automatically.

112
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.840
Sorry.

113
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.980
Whenever we upload a new product, we are automatically generating a unique ID for the modify.

114
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.860
Okay.

115
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.420
So via the first image we applaud might be 00012456478.

116
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.070
And the second image.

117
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.750
It's going to be 6125, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

118
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.980
The same thing, right?

119
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.490
Sorry.

120
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.940
Different.

121
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.270
Right.

122
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.880
Okay, so we that way flat ifab is going to know this is a different image of that.

123
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.280
Before our unity might be 881568 is 156.

124
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.580
Right.

125
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.160
And whenever we upload a new image is still going to be 88156.

126
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.490
Right.

127
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.350
And because of that Firebase is going to take that image is still the same ten.

128
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.200
So what it's just going to do is it's going to beat that image from that previous word.

129
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.250
So the new word.

130
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:27.000
Okay, but now currently we are simply using the unity package in order to automatically generate a

131
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.570
new.

132
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.620
Find them for that image.

133
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.950
Okay.

134
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.570
This is what we are basically doing.

135
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.330
If for any reason you don't understand or if there's any other issue you can do well, so let me know.

136
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.740
Okay.

137
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.640
Apart from that.

138
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.280
Okay, guys, see you in the nest next year.
