00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.710
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.320
Walker.

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.030
In this lecture, we're gonna call President Piggy video before, so we need to do firebase iterate.

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.080
Okay, now what we can do is over here, we're going to create a function.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.440
Before that, we can just give it a comment and say, function.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.670
To compress video.

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.600
Okay, now that we can create a function and are going to make this function private, which means we

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.270
don't want to view it as has this function outside this file.

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.100
So you can just call this so on underscore compress.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.610
Compress.

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.610
Okay.

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.740
Compress video.

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.150
Okay.

14
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.410
Now, over here, you're going to pass in the video parts, right?

15
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.160
Because that's what we want to compress.

16
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.710
Okay.

17
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.840
So what we can do is we can just go to the specify.

18
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
It is a type of string and now we can see video plots.

19
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.020
Okay.

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.220
That is a video, right?

21
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.660
Okay, great.

22
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.210
Now, this is going to take some time.

23
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.580
We're going to be using the weights.

24
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410
Definitely we need to use equal there.

25
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.080
Okay.

26
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.190
And now we can just go ahead and create a variable to store the compressed version of the video so we

27
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.540
can then see compressed.

28
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.570
Compressed.

29
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.480
Video.

30
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.880
Okay.

31
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.980
There's going to be courts you.

32
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.330
The rebel we installed, which we called.

33
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.420
I think it is quite so though.

34
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.090
Which record is not our package?

35
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.490
Okay.

36
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.810
Video.

37
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.440
Compress and then we can assess a mental or a function which is known as compressed video.

38
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.040
Okay.

39
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.660
As asking for the video parts.

40
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.790
The video part is going to be the video.

41
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.770
Video.

42
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.270
Okay, so video parts.

43
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.950
Okay.

44
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.130
It also has another field.

45
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.920
Which is known as the quality for the quality.

46
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.320
We can just see the video quality at medium.

47
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.710
Okay.

48
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.250
You can use on the there you can see I think we have the Laura, but I think the medium should be better.

49
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.770
That is not so bad and not too high.

50
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.160
Okay.

51
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.160
So this is basically it as well.

52
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.560
We need to await this because it takes some time.

53
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.160
Okay.

54
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.300
Now, this is basically all you need in order to compress.

55
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.460
A video.

56
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.820
Okay.

57
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.980
Now, all we need to do lastly is.

58
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.210
To return.

59
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.950
Return this variable card conquest.

60
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.200
Compressed, compressed video.

61
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.520
Okay, great.

62
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.340
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

63
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.780
I'm just gonna check.

64
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.510
Hopefully we don't have any errors.

65
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.160
Okay, fine.

66
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.510
A compressed video.

67
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.170
How we video compress that compressed video, and we are passing the parts of the video which we want

68
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.920
to compress.

69
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.730
Right.

70
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.610
And we are saying quality should be what, video quality.

71
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.000
Good.

72
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.800
Medium quality.

73
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.220
Right.

74
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.640
Okay.

75
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.440
Great.

76
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.360
And now what we can do is we're going to need to upload the.

77
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.900
Compressed version.

78
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.950
See our.

79
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.680
Firebase Storage.

80
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.940
Right.

81
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.280
Okay.

82
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.730
So to do this, I think you've seen this before, right?

83
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.120
Okay.

84
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.310
All we just have to do is to.

85
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.480
They won't commanders is to say read.

86
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.270
Okay, Rev.

87
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.370
Dodds.

88
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.520
I think Ralph adored.

89
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.840
This is going to be Ralph.

90
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.050
Court put.

91
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.020
Fi okay.

92
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.100
They were able to call that, first of all, we need to with this and then we're going to need to call

93
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.580
this.

94
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.690
That what we have.

95
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.410
Okay.

96
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.090
We also need to use the sink so we deal with all of our dysfunction.

97
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.200
And we can call.

98
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.400
You can just copy.

99
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.500
And here's this.

100
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.850
And then pass in the video part.

101
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.220
Right.

102
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.910
Okay.

103
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.520
Okay, great.

104
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.209
Now we can store the results in the variable you sent us before.

105
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.550
This is going to be something known as words upload task.

106
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.420
Okay.

107
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.660
Upload task.

108
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.330
Then applaud task.

109
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.020
There's going to be a core to this and.

110
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.000
Okay.

111
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.010
And now we can then say task and think you've seen all this task.

112
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.070
The tax snapshot.

113
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.120
And this is going to be we can call this snap and it's going to be equal to.

114
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.600
I wait once I wait for the applauding AIDS applaud.

115
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.270
I applaud Tusk.

116
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.130
Okay, great.

117
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.640
And.

118
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.940
Lastly, we're going to need to get the you are all of the uploaded video right away so you can just

119
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.280
drink and download.

120
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.940
Download Jarrell is going to be equal to the words just good and the way it is and is going to be the

121
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.410
snap described via.

122
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.300
It's not.

123
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.310
That's what's the truth.

124
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.090
Ten dots get download Yarrow.

125
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.930
Okay.

126
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.120
And lastly, we can return.

127
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.340
Return to Dollar Lord.

128
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.610
I think you've seen this before.

129
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.340
If you have not.

130
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.300
I think you can just try to make sure you've forgotten.

131
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.160
You can just try to go back to it again.

132
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.160
Definitely.

133
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.870
You're going to forget.

134
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.290
Okay.

135
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.570
So we can just go ahead and make this a future.

136
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.230
Future is going to take some time to process.

137
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.420
All the details are going to be strength.

138
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.090
All the everything we have always is strength.

139
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.270
That's why we are parsing yet passing over this string here.

140
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.650
Okay.

141
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.800
Now.

142
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.820
This is basically it.

143
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.500
This is all we need over here is a function to confirm.

144
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.340
The video over here is to upload the video to discourage.

145
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.710
Then this is the main function.

146
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.910
You can see every function we have over here is tied to this.

147
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.730
You can see the.

148
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.220
The quality of what we did, the turned away.

149
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.450
Right.

150
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.870
Okay.

151
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.550
This is basically it.

152
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.010
Okay.

153
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.780
Whenever we call this upload function, you can see we are not making it private.

154
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.940
And the reason for this is.

155
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.380
So we are going to be able to call it in the, I think, the screen file.

156
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.830
Right.

157
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.960
Then I thought we call.

158
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.320
When we call, we will call this function we need to pass in the value that is the song name the value

159
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.160
to song name the value to the caption and the value.

160
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.610
That is the video pot's value for now, all this are just dynamic variable.

161
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:07.180
So whenever we call this function, they're going to need to pass in all this values to this verbose

162
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.660
we have.

163
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.200
And over here, you can see we don't have the value yet.

164
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.980
So whenever we call it so, as in this end wants in in the future, the video is going to be that is

165
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.500
the review.

166
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.270
The video is going to be right.

167
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.420
So we are going to compress it and then uploaded to the storage.

168
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.900
Okay.

169
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:33.820
You can see over here we created a variable called compressed video in another get the the the compressed

170
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.740
video file.

171
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.640
So I think over here.

172
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.300
We need to see dots.

173
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.400
Fine.

174
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.910
Okay.

175
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.990
I almost forgot this.

176
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.650
Okay.

177
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.370
Sorry.

178
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.910
Okay.

179
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.360
Okay.

180
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.340
That's basically it.

181
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.060
Okay.

182
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.610
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
