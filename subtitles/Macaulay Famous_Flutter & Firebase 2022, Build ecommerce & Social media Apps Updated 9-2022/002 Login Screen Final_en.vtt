00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.300
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.050
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.820
Sorry.

4
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.130
This should be neat.

5
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.020
Need an account.

6
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.770
Okay.

7
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.480
I need an account.

8
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.410
Then there is a link to take them to the sign up page.

9
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.440
Okay.

10
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.260
Now we can use control to save.

11
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
And now we can go to the London customer screen.

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.040
Land of customers screen.

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.770
Okay.

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.230
And if they already have an account, then there should be a link to take them to the login screen.

15
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.320
They already have.

16
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.880
Already have an account.

17
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.440
And over here we can then say Navigator.

18
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.060
Darts.

19
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.070
Of.

20
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.030
Contest.

21
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.480
Dirt push.

22
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.160
And for the roots, this is going to be something known as Matt Syria.

23
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.870
Age roots.

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.180
And as you know, this is going to take in the context and we can specify it is a type of build.

25
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.510
Build.

26
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.660
This.

27
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.140
Okay.

28
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.890
Great.

29
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.160
And now we can just go out and had a semicolon over here.

30
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.750
Then within a year we can return the customer.

31
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.990
Of course, Summer.

32
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.750
Hello again.

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.470
Logon screen.

34
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.010
Okay.

35
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.470
All right.

36
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.160
This.

37
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.790
Okay.

38
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.170
This contract is safe.

39
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.750
But before that, you can see we.

40
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.590
We can.

41
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.050
Okay.

42
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
We just have to restart this.

43
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.790
Well to start this or to start this.

44
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.550
And we're going to be able to navigate within those two pages.

45
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.010
I don't know why it's taken longer this time around.

46
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.600
Okay.

47
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.920
This is going to take us back to the.

48
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.850
The customer log in screen.

49
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.390
Okay.

50
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.120
And now I can click on this.

51
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.100
If I do have an account or sorry, if I need an account, I can click on the sign up.

52
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.780
Okay.

53
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
And if I already have an account, I can click on this login.

54
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.300
Okay.

55
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.120
Sounds good.

56
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.570
Okay, guys.

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.300
See you in the next lecture.
