Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.370
Welcome.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.610
In this lecture, we're going to store the package we need in order to compress the video.

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.200
Okay, not to do this.

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.910
Head up to your pop dot dev.

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.620
Then over here, you're going to search for video compress.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.330
Okay.

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.430
And you can see what it does.

9
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.610
Light Library for video manipulation of water compress video, remove audio.

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.220
Get video thumbnail.

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.580
From that code.

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.980
You can see what it does.

13
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.250
Okay, we can just click on this.

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.140
And now we can copy the code and then head up to our visa code.

15
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.220
And then.

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.050
Paul.

17
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.900
The dev.

18
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.600
So I think was vague that that.

19
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.380
Yeah, I.

20
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.960
Okay.

21
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.900
And we're gonna need to paste this right after the video player.

22
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.360
Okay.

23
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.690
So you can see this package.

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.020
You.

25
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.720
We don't only use it for compressing the video as well.

26
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.450
We can use it to get some nails from.

27
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.130
A video.

28
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.540
Okay.

29
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.070
So what we can do is to use control.

30
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.630
Okay, Control.

31
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.550
And you see this fight or click on this in order to get the package.

32
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.360
The key case is getting the package.

33
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.720
Okay.

34
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.180
The system is.

35
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130
Restart your vehicle in order to make that change.

36
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.590
Okay.

37
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.290
Or make sure it picks the change.

38
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.740
Okay?

39
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.710
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
