00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.450
Welcome in this lecture are going to be able to click on this in order to delete the order.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.900
Okay.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.930
Now to do this, you're going to need to go back to our VSP code and then the design for each other.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.620
Okay.

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.370
Now we're going to look for that console delete button.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.640
Okay, I think this is it or via the competition icons dot delete underscore left.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.369
We can just changes to blue to make sure that's the delete icon.

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.940
Okay.

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.080
Okay.

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.700
We can use contra and this to save.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.230
Sorry.

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.140
Contrariness.

14
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.950
And check if he's going to sound too blue.

15
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.190
Okay, you can see it.

16
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.690
There's the eye.

17
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.430
Okay, so right here.

18
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.190
All, what we just have to do is score the fan base.

19
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.690
I think we have it in the cards directory already.

20
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.130
Sorry.

21
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.530
The CROSSFIRE.

22
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.570
No, I keep calling the directory like it caused.

23
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.170
Sorry.

24
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.030
Firebase Store.

25
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.030
Then Dodge Collection.

26
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
Then you're going to need to go into the others collection.

27
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.510
Then we're going to have access to these documents.

28
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.380
Okay.

29
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.010
Now, remember, each document is connected to this address by the other Heidi.

30
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.820
Right.

31
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.460
So what we can say is we can call this.

32
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.750
People have over here.

33
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.410
That's a tall order, at least.

34
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.670
Other.

35
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.110
Other least.

36
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.820
Then the court order ID.

37
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.080
Okay, then over here.

38
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.170
All what we just have to say is not.

39
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.820
Delete.

40
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.810
Okay.

41
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.790
Great, nice country.

42
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.780
And that's the scene.

43
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.130
And.

44
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.300
And true.

45
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.240
And this and click on this.

46
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.360
Okay.

47
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.850
Let's just try to click on every of those.

48
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.640
And check.

49
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.780
Okay.

50
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.990
You can see it's been deleted by a.

51
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.890
Okay.

52
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.240
Now, I think.

53
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.810
Let's go back and.

54
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.030
Come to the game and see.

55
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.310
Okay.

56
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.930
One, two, two, four.

57
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.910
Okay, I think.

58
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.590
Okay.

59
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.430
What we can do is to start this and see.

60
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.330
What was that thing?

61
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.530
Okay.

62
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.980
Okay.

63
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.470
Okay.

64
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.850
Now.

65
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.390
Dan, let's go back to.

66
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.480
The.

67
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.670
Okay.

68
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.490
My orders.

69
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.160
As you can see, it has been deleted and currently we have just okay, we have just two orders.

70
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.000
Okay.

71
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.200
Now the issue is.

72
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.470
It is not just playing with time on the screen.

73
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.130
That's Mays.

74
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.620
We have to refresh, you know, that to see that we have deleted the audio.

75
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.420
So what we can do is.

76
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.580
You can see it's been deleted re time will that but we are not having any changes in the UI.

77
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.140
Okay.

78
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.460
Now.

79
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.000
Hard to start this again.

80
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.320
And you're going to see we don't have any other anymore.

81
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.720
Okay.

82
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.860
I was going to check this again for you quickly.

83
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.670
Okay.

84
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.540
Okay, okay.

85
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.350
Okay, okay.

86
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.770
Okay.

87
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.250
I can see currently we don't have any other and.

88
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.440
Now let's go back to the apple and.

89
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.910
My orders.

90
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.780
Okay.

91
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.730
You can see the black screen.

92
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.000
We don't have any others like it.

93
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.690
What we can do is just try to identify products.

94
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.530
You can marvel at some small network and.

95
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.920
Checkouts.

96
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.110
Okay.

97
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.240
You can see the view now.

98
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:20.690
Okay.

99
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.250
And.

100
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.050
Okay.

101
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.890
It has not been displayed.

102
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.800
What we can do is also discharges.

103
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.050
Audrey starts in again and.

104
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.840
Now.

105
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.710
Let's go check it out.

106
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.930
And you can see some of the books we have.

107
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.980
Okay.

108
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.870
We're going to freeze that shortly.

109
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.260
Okay.

110
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.740
So now let's go back to.

111
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.480
My others.

112
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.090
Okay, you can see that means we have.

113
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.380
So refresh.

114
00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.740
Okay.

115
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.300
Seen in this lecture.

116
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.950
Ready to solve this book?

117
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.400
Okay.
