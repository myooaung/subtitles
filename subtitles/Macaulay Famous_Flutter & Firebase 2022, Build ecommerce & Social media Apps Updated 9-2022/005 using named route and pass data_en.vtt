00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.370
Hi worker.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.970
In the last lecture, we created this method in order to get the products ID.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.690
And the reason for this is whenever a user clicks on any of the products, we then want to take the

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.320
user to the user page of that product.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.720
Right.

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.110
Okay.

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
So now the next step problem that need to take is we're going to go to the Fields products.

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.530
Okay.

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.800
Or Via.

10
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.670
And now we can use control and be in order to make this white.

11
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.110
Okay.

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.210
Now, the next thing we're going to need to do is we're gonna make this clickable in order to make this

13
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.840
clickable.

14
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.960
They're going to wrap all this with a button, right?

15
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.800
Probably where you have it in your life records.

16
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.550
All you just have to do is over here.

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.400
You're going to need to highlight and use control and dots.

18
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.470
And since we don't have the type of widget, we want to have a little click on wrap with widget.

19
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.470
And we're going to wrap this with the gesture detector where you can as well wrap this with an equal

20
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.910
button.

21
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.170
Okay, gesture detector.

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.840
And as you know, the gesture detector and the inkwell has a property known as on tap.

23
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.860
Okay.

24
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.390
Great.

25
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.050
Now, the next step or the next approach you need to take is to pass this productive table, whereby

26
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.080
this productive table has access to all our product data, such as the product image.

27
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.860
You are well.

28
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.660
You put out the tie to your product prize and so on.

29
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.530
So the next thing you need to do is to pass this product verbal.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.160
So the detail page, then, then that's a positive product variable.

31
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.020
It is fixed in navigation.

32
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
So we're never out navigation, which is also, you know, that type of navigating.

33
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.350
We've seen pages.

34
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.740
Okay.

35
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.460
So not to do that, all we just have to do first is to use control and the.

36
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.530
Okay.

37
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.990
Then we're going to need to go to the detail page.

38
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.360
Okay, and we can use control and B so we are going to create in them root navigation, which I said

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.430
is another way of navigating within pages.

40
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.780
Okay.

41
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.350
So if they are going to say static said, become global, accessible, and it's going to be a type of

42
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.100
cause and a type of string and we're going to call this ID, we can also call this name.

43
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.470
Okay.

44
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.660
This is going to be equal to the roots is going to be required to yield.

45
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.510
Just going to call this detail page.

46
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.950
Okay.

47
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.690
And over here, rebels need to have this semicolon.

48
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.070
Okay.

49
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.480
And.

50
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.360
We can then use contra and S to save that nest if they're going to take is going to go to the main door.

51
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.280
That's why in order to declare this route.

52
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.980
So control B and.

53
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.540
They thought that's my.

54
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.280
So all they.

55
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.750
Within the Matsuri I have first of all, I just all very, very difficult as culture sorry how to try

56
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.770
to convert and use control and to save.

57
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.850
Okay.

58
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.380
Great.

59
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.950
Now we take the matter up.

60
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.670
The material has a property known as roots.

61
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.920
Okay, roots.

62
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.220
And now we can declare that drought we just created.

63
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.040
So this is going to be a detail page in order to assess the name, which we also called.

64
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.960
It's a page I need to say it.

65
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.830
Okay.

66
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.870
It's going to take in contests which is referring to the comrades page we are currently and no function.

67
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.460
Okay.

68
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.990
And.

69
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.280
Detail page.

70
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.140
Okay, great.

71
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.350
Now you can see with the other close details.

72
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.300
So we just have to do is to go back to the.

73
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.020
Fields.

74
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.450
So a digital trade rights detail page.

75
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.760
And we can't just get rid of all this.

76
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.180
Okay.

77
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.130
For now, we're just going to go with this.

78
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.720
Okay.

79
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.190
Go with this error for now.

80
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.580
Okay.

81
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.380
What you can see it is no longer.

82
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.760
Okay.

83
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.160
So we need to get rid of this.

84
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.300
Okay, great.

85
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.990
Okay.

86
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.720
Now this culture and society is fine, or we just need to either take over as well.

87
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.870
Okay, now we're going to go back to the fields of products.

88
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.340
Fields products.

89
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.880
Okay.

90
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.350
Is it over here?

91
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.910
Not the fifth screen, but.

92
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.579
Okay.

93
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.930
I think.

94
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.800
Is it a widget?

95
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.780
Okay.

96
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.400
Fields products.

97
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.970
Okay.

98
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.040
Now Voice Recognition.

99
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.060
Navigator.

100
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.950
Navigator.

101
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.510
Dirt of contest then is going to be dirt.

102
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.920
Push name is asking for the roots name.

103
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.940
The roots name is going to be the detail.

104
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.650
Page.

105
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.330
Got it.

106
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.710
Okay, great.

107
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.220
Now, this basically it's not the nest egg you need to check is to not pass this printouts variable

108
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.360
to the detail page.

109
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.810
Not to simply do that or we just have to do is to hide the true cover.

110
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.060
And I'm going to need to say arguments.

111
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.960
Right.

112
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.950
Argument it is going to be this variable called products.

113
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.060
Then you, Heidi, of the projects.

114
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.150
Okay, great.

115
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.260
Now you can see you're beginning to see the reason for this.

116
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.180
Right.

117
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.570
But hopefully you're going to see this fully in the next lecture.

118
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.170
So first of all, what I'm just going to do is to get rid of this error so I know what I'm going to

119
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.290
be.

120
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.170
Isn't this we can just get rid of this and just add.

121
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.050
Is this one now?

122
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.880
Okay.

123
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.830
Get rid of this as well.

124
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.090
Add this.

125
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.740
Look at your trailer, comma.

126
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.880
Okay.

127
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.620
He has contributed to save or is going to need to restart this.

128
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.800
So it's save those of saved face.

129
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.390
Right.

130
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.750
Okay.

131
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.080
So in investiture, you're fully going to see why we created this little site to get the product to

132
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.380
it.

133
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.360
Okay.

134
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.240
Now, what we simply have done is we have simply passed this product.

135
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.230
Okay.

136
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.620
We've simply passed this.

137
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.770
Okay.

138
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.220
If it's true that we simply of course, the product to digital page.

139
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.920
Right.

140
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.320
Okay.

141
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.850
Okay.

142
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.090
You can see currently we don't have any water rights.

143
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.440
Okay so in in this lecture regular display that products.

144
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.820
Okay.

145
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.910
Okay, guys, see you in in this lecture.
