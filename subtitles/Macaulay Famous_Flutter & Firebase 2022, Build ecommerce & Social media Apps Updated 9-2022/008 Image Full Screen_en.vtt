00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.650
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.570
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.550
In this lecture, we are going to be able to see the full screen of the image.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.040
Not to do this, we have to head back to our via code and over this image widget.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.360
That is the size box we are going to highlight and use control and dots.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.830
We are going to wrap it with a button and it's going to be a type of gesture detector.

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.120
And as well, we can wrap this with an equal gesture.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.210
The architecture.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.530
And as you know, the jester detector has a property known as on tap.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.990
Okay.

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.780
And on top, what we want to do is we want to go to the full screen.

12
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.740
So what we have to do is to create a new screen.

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.490
And we are going to create this new screen in this widget directory, new file and.

14
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.190
They're going to call this five full.

15
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.180
On this score he made on the score screen and the section is the darts.

16
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.580
Okay.

17
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.000
And we're going to be using the stateful widget.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the reason for this is because in the future we are going to be able to update the UI.

19
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.570
Okay.

20
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.310
So we have to use a stateful widget and as well we can call this full image screen.

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.900
And what we have to do now is to highlight and use control and dots in order to import the material

22
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.160
that that package.

23
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.790
And for now, we can get rid of this.

24
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.810
Okay.

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.470
And in order to have access to a lot of property, what we can do is we can get rid of this container

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.610
and then use a scaffold, widgets, scaffold.

27
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.120
Okay.

28
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.690
And as you know, the scaffold has a property known as Upper Harbour.

29
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.070
Okay.

30
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.639
And as you know, the harbor has a property known as background color.

31
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.940
And we're going to set it to colors those white.

32
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.420
Also we can get rid of the elevation by saying elevation is going to be zero.

33
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.670
Okay.

34
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.100
All right.

35
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.330
We need a semicolon and use an essay in.

36
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.990
Back to the details screen.

37
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.690
Okay.

38
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.310
Products detail.

39
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.170
And what we want to do is to push to that screen.

40
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.890
To do that, we have to say navigator.

41
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.880
Dot push.

42
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.150
You can see it automatically past the contest as well.

43
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.000
And.

44
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.840
This is going to be much severe.

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.320
Material.

46
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.070
Page.

47
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.850
Page.

48
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.810
And.

49
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.320
Context.

50
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.920
Context is basically referring to the current stage that is the screen.

51
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.420
And what we have to do is to return.

52
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.060
Return what?

53
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.730
Return the full.

54
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.320
Full image.

55
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.370
Full image screen.

56
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.920
And obviously we need this and as well we need this.

57
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.330
Okay.

58
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.610
And now we start this.

59
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.080
Okay.

60
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.010
We just have to wait for this a bit, but hopefully everything is going to work as expected.

61
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.150
Okay.

62
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.590
Performing all three starts.

63
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.920
It's going to take us back to the cellar login screen and we have to then log in again.

64
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.540
OC OC for the iMac is famous.

65
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.440
In my store.

66
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:53.540
Jameel did come and the password is b e G-A-Y and a C and log in.

67
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.680
Okay.

68
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.310
It's going to take some time to.

69
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.440
Log in the accounts based on your network connection.

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.040
I think I made a mistake.

71
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.080
Okay.

72
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.960
Missing.

73
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.700
And he.

74
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.390
Okay.

75
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.650
Okay.

76
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.000
Okay, great.

77
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.500
Let's click on this.

78
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.720
It's going to take us to the product detail.

79
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.100
And when we click on this, yeah, it should take us to the image full screen.

80
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.670
Okay.

81
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.710
Now we are going to start putting that.

82
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.300
Okay, back to the widget directory and then the full image screen.

83
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.820
You know why?

84
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.680
Harder to recover.

85
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.990
And what we also want is we want an HIA over here, but there is already an air of just that.

86
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.780
The opera has a colour of white and that is why you can't see that.

87
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.430
So what we have to do is why we can then say icon same and this is going to be icon.

88
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.540
I can't seem.

89
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.170
Data.

90
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.050
And we're going to say color.

91
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.400
This is going to be colors that black.

92
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.860
Okay.

93
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.430
You can try and save.

94
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.860
So.

95
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.080
Okay.

96
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.170
You can see it.

97
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.680
All right.

98
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.830
Okay.

99
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.290
And now we're going to continue.

100
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.230
And we send the body.

101
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.650
We tend to body.

102
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.140
We can then have a column with that and a column containing multiple widgets which are going to be displayed

103
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.250
horizontally.

104
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.080
And the first chart is going to be a test widget.

105
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.460
Test.

106
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.170
And for now, I'm just going to say one divide, maybe two, three.

107
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.860
Okay.

108
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.520
We can start this and test tie.

109
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.110
To start.

110
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.190
We can increase the font size to 24.

111
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.730
Or 27 and font sweet.

112
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.670
Fonts, which.

113
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.650
The Board and we need this and use control necessary.

114
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.820
Look, you're going to see the here now.

115
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.710
Okay.

116
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.770
And what we can then do is we can wrap this test with that with a center, rapid center to take it to

117
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.640
the center.

118
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.320
Okay.

119
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm just going to use Contra and B to make this wide.

120
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.460
Okay.

121
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.220
Okay, great.

122
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.270
And now the next charge is going to be for the image.

123
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.940
And what we can do is we can have a size box.

124
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:47.060
Size box, and we can give this a sizable, say, height and what we can do in order to make this responsive,

125
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.910
we can get the height of our screen by same media query.

126
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.390
Lot of context.

127
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.740
Dot size, dot wheat, sorry, dot height.

128
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:05.290
And what we basically want to do is to time it by 0.5, depending on the screen.

129
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.790
Okay.

130
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.800
And now we can have a child.

131
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.800
And this is going to be a page for you.

132
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.080
And the reason for the page is because we are going to be able to scroll our images this way.

133
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.860
So to do that, we have to use what a page view.

134
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.610
And I think you said this before page view or probably you saw the page view the view, the.

135
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.430
Okay.

136
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.350
And as you know, the page, you can take multiple widgets as well, children.

137
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.870
And what we can do, we can get rid of this.

138
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.540
And we're going to say list dot.

139
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.800
Generate.

140
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.350
Okay, is asking for the length of the image.

141
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.720
So what we have to do is to pass our image from the detail page to the screen.

142
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.000
To do that over here.

143
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.150
We are just going to create a divider.

144
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.440
Okay.

145
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.200
Well, yeah, we can say finer and dynamic.

146
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:13.470
And we're going to call this image list and we have to pass it on to the constructor a light and use

147
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.930
constraint that creates constructor for final fields, and you can see it automatically passed the required

148
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.410
keyword.

149
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.050
So anyway, we are calling this image full screen.

150
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.060
We then have to pass the value to this variable and you can see we are calling it over here.

151
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:28.940
Okay.

152
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:37.880
So this is going to be image image list and we have to pass this image images via.

153
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.460
Okay.

154
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.049
Images.

155
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:45.690
Okay.

156
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.530
That's basically it.

157
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.710
Okay, now we have it over here.

158
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.090
So for the length, this is going to be the image he made list.

159
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.560
Okay.

160
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.180
We have that.

161
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.370
That is a top level variable.

162
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.880
You can see why it is a top level variable because it is outside this state.

163
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.450
Right.

164
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.460
So what we have to do is in order to assess that, we have to say widgets.

165
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.210
We judge then those images.

166
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.600
Okay.

167
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.340
And we then have to say.

168
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:20.800
Okay.

169
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:27.350
What we could also do is to tell that that this is at list of images.

170
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.910
What we can do is have a list of why and have this and others.

171
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.250
Okay.

172
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.380
So by that, it's going to know this rainbow is a list.

173
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:37.660
Okay.

174
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.050
And now we can have access to the DOD lens.

175
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.740
Okay.

176
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.900
And for this, what we have to do is to get rid of this.

177
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.220
And we are going to return an image.

178
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.140
He made.

179
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.090
Dot.

180
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.650
Network.

181
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.130
And this is going to be image list.

182
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.920
And we just have to pass the.

183
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.720
In dance.

184
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.250
So assess ish images.

185
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:10.780
Okay.

186
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.550
Sorry.

187
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.380
It is a top level variable.

188
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.170
And in order to assess that, we have to say we widget.

189
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.630
Which ads does what image list and intends to assess each image.

190
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.290
And also, we can just convert this to a string.

191
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:34.960
If if maybe we are converting to a string in case is not saying it as a string and this is basically

192
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.300
it is trying to save or maybe we would need an auto restart.

193
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.280
Okay.

194
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.430
No.

195
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.030
Okay.

196
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.710
With merchant agreement declared.

197
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.120
Okay.

198
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.290
We just have to use the to start.

199
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:58.400
To all three start it and hopefully is going to work as expected for sure.

200
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.300
Okay.

201
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.480
We have to know how to start this.

202
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.900
And we have to.

203
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.200
If it was.

204
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.220
Store.

205
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.220
Okay.

206
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.980
Log in.

207
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.340
Okay.

208
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.520
Click on this and click on this.

209
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.150
Okay?

210
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.990
Sims Cool.

211
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.510
And it's working as expected.

212
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.250
And this is a network image.

213
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.530
You can see some school, right?

214
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.170
Okay.

215
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:47.950
Okay.

216
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.670
Back.

217
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.070
Okay.

218
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.110
Click on this.

219
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.350
Cisco, right.

220
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.360
Okay.

221
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:04.810
And now what we can also do over here, we can have a back harder to do that we have to head back to

222
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.530
the product detail, screen product detail.

223
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:14.980
And all we just have to do is to wrap this gesture detector, which is stack.

224
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.400
With that, you basically you start to place widget onto a widget.

225
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.530
We can just wrap this first with a row.

226
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.330
So it's a row.

227
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.990
Then we're going to rename this to say stock.

228
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.440
Stack.

229
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.080
Okay.

230
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.160
Okay.

231
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.330
And within the stock, you can see this is the first chart.

232
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.950
Right for the image and we want to place that on top of that image.

233
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.550
So what we basically did was to wrap it with this stack.

234
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.330
And remember I said you basically you start to place widget on top widget.

235
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:55.720
So for that and after this, we're going to have something known as position, which has to do with

236
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.520
how we are going to place that widget.

237
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.070
And for the chart, it's going to be icon.

238
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.280
Icon widget.

239
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.450
Okay.

240
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.190
Okay.

241
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.720
I can't button.

242
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.510
And it would take the press and this and this and also the child.

243
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.300
Sorry.

244
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.380
Child.

245
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.080
Is going to do this again and with water protection icon button.

246
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.670
Okay.

247
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.400
This.

248
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.330
This.

249
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.660
Okay.

250
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.930
And for the icon.

251
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.190
This is going to be icons icon, right?

252
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.510
And icons Dot Harrell.

253
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.200
I wrote.

254
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.770
So.

255
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.960
I call that horror.

256
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.220
I think we have the underscore.

257
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.930
Back.

258
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.410
How is okay.

259
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.090
This and how this.

260
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:05.840
Okay.

261
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.130
Is control necessary?

262
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.950
She said via.

263
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.800
Okay.

264
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.830
You can see it over there.

265
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.910
Now what we can do?

266
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.700
We can sit top.

267
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.280
So maybe 15.

268
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.720
Right.

269
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.660
That was why we have to use this position.

270
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.270
It's going to calm down a bit.

271
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.090
Okay.

272
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.770
Or we can just say 20.

273
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.650
And left.

274
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:34.600
So.

275
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.290
I see.

276
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:37.440
Okay.

277
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.790
It's unnecessary.

278
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.880
And we check it out.

279
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.990
Okay.

280
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.070
I think I'm just going to say top maybe 30.

281
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.780
Okay.

282
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.250
And all we just have to do now is why we can then say Navigator.

283
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.110
Navigator.

284
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.140
Navigator.

285
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.210
Okay.

286
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.420
Navigator Dot Pop.

287
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.590
What we do is it you pop this current screen and basically just take us back.

288
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.180
We are basically saying we want to remove this current screen and go back.

289
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:17.790
Okay.

290
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.230
You can sit over there and you can click on it.

291
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.350
I think we just have to say maybe top.

292
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:31.120
50 or a foot is okay and left is going to be 15.

293
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.090
Okay.

294
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.350
Okay.

295
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.170
I think it's cool.

296
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.680
Yeah.

297
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.540
Okay.

298
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.700
Or maybe just ten.

299
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:44.860
Okay.

300
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.860
She's sitting right now.

301
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.390
Okay.

302
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.290
Click on this.

303
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.970
Okay.

304
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.240
Sims.

305
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.700
Cool.

306
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.620
Cisco.

307
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.580
And you could also style this, maybe wrap it with a container and have a color through it.

308
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.730
I believe you already know how to do that.

309
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.870
Okay.

310
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.900
Everything is working as planned.

311
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.470
Okay.

312
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.530
Okay.

313
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.010
The contest we have just won.

314
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.520
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
