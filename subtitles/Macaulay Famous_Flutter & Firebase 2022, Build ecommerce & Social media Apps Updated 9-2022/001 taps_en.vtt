00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.580
In this lecture, we are going to talk about tabs.

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.130
Now, what we are going to do in this lecture is we're going to have four tabs over here, which is

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.170
going to serve as the category.

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:22.380
That is the main categories, the women categories, the kids categories and the shoes categories.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.270
Okay, nine, let's do this.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:33.060
We have to go back to our basic code and then the home screen and what we can do, we can use control

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.830
and B to make this wide.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:42.900
And in order to use tabs, we are going to wrap this covered with something known as default tab controllers.

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:53.760
So we have to highlight and use control wrap with widgets and it is called default tab controller.

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.590
Okay.

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.090
And now we have to specify how many tabs we need to do that.

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.190
The default tab controller has a property known as length.

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.460
And for the now we can go with for.

16
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.970
Okay.

17
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.730
And now within the harbor, the harbor has a property known as Bertram.

18
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:28.370
The key for the property is going to be something known as Tab Bar and this can take multiple tabs.

19
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.890
So it adds this tabs property.

20
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.060
Okay.

21
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.580
And now the first is going to be it is going to say tabs.

22
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.040
And this tab has the child property, which is going to be a test widget.

23
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.680
And this is going to say men.

24
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.630
Then we can then copy these tops.

25
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.490
Intense.

26
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.900
Tennessee writes, We can just break this to the nurse line if we should save.

27
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.820
Now, we are going to have an error because we said we want TV tabs, we want four tabs, and currently

28
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.680
we just have one.

29
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.250
Okay, so now we have to.

30
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.340
Sorry, not there, but over here.

31
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.770
Hydrogen newcomer and paste.

32
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.940
Look how they're trying to out and pins this.

33
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.880
It should be a.

34
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.410
I'm just going to look after it here.

35
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.370
Okay.

36
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.080
I use controller and save.

37
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.680
And currently we have just two tabs.

38
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.290
Had.

39
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.570
You train and use control and say, okay, now we have three tabs.

40
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.010
You can see it is expecting.

41
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.340
See.

42
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.250
Can we?

43
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.500
It is expecting four tops and currently we have just three.

44
00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.700
So we have to have the chilled cover and paste this use control and has to save and this area is going

45
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.180
to be gone and default.

46
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.890
This test is going to take the colour of whites and that is why we are unable to see this.

47
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.310
So what we have to do is to add a start to this test tie.

48
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.010
And over a year we definitely need to turn the corner.

49
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.990
And for the color we can see colors, dark, gray, and probably with my heart, its heart.

50
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.060
Some shade of 600.

51
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.400
Okay.

52
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.600
What we can just do is we can copy this.

53
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.660
Copy this from this Thai.

54
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.870
It is over a year.

55
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.950
Had your trainer coma and his this.

56
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:55.010
Had your career and PCs had your career and paced this and use control and that's a safe and definitely

57
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.180
you're going to see it now.

58
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.290
Okay.

59
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.400
Sounds good.

60
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.930
Right.

61
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.050
And now we have to change the top name like it is.

62
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.950
It's going to be man.

63
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.990
And this is going to be.

64
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.240
Blue.

65
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.610
Men, all men, women and.

66
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.410
This is going to be for maybe the kids categories.

67
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.420
And this is going to be for the shoes categories.

68
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.380
Okay.

69
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.430
Go check it out.

70
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.950
You can see 911 in the next lecture, we're going to have content for each categories.

71
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.940
So whenever we go to when we go to, when we navigate to the main, we are going to have a test over

72
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.680
here which is going to say men.

73
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.180
And when we navigate to the women, we are going to have the test and so hard.

74
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.920
Okay.

75
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.820
Okay, guys.

76
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.680
See you in the next day.
