Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.050
In this lecture, we're going to do a record of what we did in the previous lecture, but before then

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.680
you can see the account has been successfully been created and you can see we have now the users collection

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.160
and now we have the user and each user is being connected to this user's collection.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.570
And for now we have just one user or we have just one documents or we have just one file.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.450
In other words, you can refer to each user as a document or a file.

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
So for the now, we have just one file.

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.190
Okay?

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.980
Now we are going to do a record of what we did in the previous lecture.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.750
First of all, over here we had an E statement and we are basically saying if the fields are not empty,

12
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.360
that is if the fields are filled.

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.590
And then only we want to create a user.

14
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.370
And over here we are simply storing or saving the result in a variable called creed.

15
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.830
And remember, this creed has access to all the user's property, such as the UID of the user and even

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.600
the email address of the user.

17
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.930
Over here we can as well say prints.

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.010
Creed.

19
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.510
Dot.

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.160
User dots.

21
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.620
Email.

22
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.580
You can see.

23
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.750
So we also do have access to the email address of the user.

24
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.280
And over here we then want to create the user ID faster.

25
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.260
First of all, we're first we created a collection called Users and we are saying we want to create

26
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.550
a document or we want to create a user that has this fields that is the full name, the email.

27
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.690
Right.

28
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.780
And remember I said this user are going to be connected.

29
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.140
So this is a collection based on something known as UID.

30
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.640
So we are using the auto generated id uid of the user or via and that is what you're basically saying

31
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.480
over here.

32
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.449
Now let's compare this and once we have.

33
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.700
Yeah.

34
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.020
You can see why.

35
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.340
For l.

36
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.150
Y4 sl.

37
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.950
So basically using this ID.

38
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.350
Over.

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.460
Yeah.

40
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.630
Okay.

41
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.810
So last time.

42
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.690
We said if the streets are not empty, we want to create a user with the email password, restored the

43
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.290
results and a variable called Create, which is the type of user credential.

44
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.330
And this is basically the short form of credential, but we just called it screed and over here we created

45
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.210
a collection called The Users and we are saying we want to create.

46
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.110
A user.

47
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.990
Remember the doc is referring to the user or is referring to the fae.

48
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.110
Right.

49
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.690
Okay.

50
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.290
So we are saying we want to create a user that has the full name and the email field as well.

51
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.030
You can have more users, so you can just change the email address to something else and click on sign

52
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.330
up.

53
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.940
Okay.

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.270
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
