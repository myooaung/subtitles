00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.060
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.640
Worker In this lecture, we're getting people to generate a unique order ID number.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.060
Okay.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.490
Now, the first step to take is to create a variable to store that you ID.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.500
We just as store gases.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.690
You're going to need to first initialize it.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.010
Okay.

8
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.420
Now, to do this, we can basically go to the cause phi in order to initialize it.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
But since this is just if y you're going to be using, it's really there's no need of going to that

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.910
directory or that's fine.

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.380
Okay.

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.770
Now your first step you're going to take, like I said, is so initialize it.

13
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.070
Okay?

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
So we can just go to the top over here.

15
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.000
We can just do this within the contest.

16
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.230
Well, as well.

17
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.360
You can do this outside.

18
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.700
Okay.

19
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.010
So you can't say Var and we can call this you, you ID and it's going to be equal to the package that

20
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.260
is the you ID.

21
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.980
Okay.

22
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.540
And.

23
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.180
Okay, great.

24
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.690
Then then this step.

25
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.860
I think we need to import a light and then use control.

26
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.560
And that's okay for us.

27
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.180
Okay, great.

28
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.410
Now, the next step is to now generate a unique I.D. number.

29
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.860
Okay.

30
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.120
Cell.

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.670
We're going to do this over here.

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.210
We're going to create a finite variable and you're going to quads variable order ID is going to be equal

33
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.630
to that variable called you you ID then.

34
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.610
To generate a unique number.

35
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.760
We are just going to say dot the four.

36
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670
Okay, so you know this.

37
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.590
We're going to get rid sorry, not that stuff.

38
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.140
This is going to get rid of this and then say or the ID.

39
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.230
Okay.

40
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.460
Is it of this?

41
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.880
Right then going to say order the I'd.

42
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.800
Okay.

43
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.460
Great.

44
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.080
Okay.

45
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.530
Now, this is not gonna be data by date.

46
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.180
Okay, we can just.

47
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.410
We start this.

48
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.900
Okay.

49
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.980
It's going to take some time and we can now try it out.

50
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.900
Okay.

51
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.350
Okay.

52
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.770
Okay.

53
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.160
Okay.

54
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.580
Okay.

55
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.000
Okay.

56
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.390
Okay.

57
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.810
Okay.

58
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.170
Okay.

59
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.590
Okay.

60
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.980
Okay.

61
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.370
Okay.

62
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.730
Okay.

63
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.180
Okay.

64
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.600
Okay.

65
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.040
It's done.

66
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.370
Okay.

67
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.300
And now we can change is going to give a hard to start to this up and we are going to go just check

68
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.620
it out and click on this add to cart and then.

69
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.790
Cats create.

70
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.090
And.

71
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.920
Now we can.

72
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.920
Either you can click or check out.

73
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.100
Okay, now let's go check it out.

74
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.580
Okay.

75
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.630
What I simply did was to delete my other collection.

76
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.700
I think you're going to see something like that over here.

77
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.420
Then you're going to need to tap the collection you want to delete.

78
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.140
Okay.

79
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.510
I think you can just do that.

80
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.800
Okay.

81
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.130
So I'm going to go to this.

82
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.420
You don't really need to delete it, though.

83
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.910
You can just come to the doorway.

84
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.170
Okay.

85
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.360
Again, you can see the wire and you can see the unique or the number of you can see it.

86
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.770
Okay.

87
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.960
And we just need to order just one product.

88
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.310
Okay.

89
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.550
Now, let's try to order multiple item.

90
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.120
Okay.

91
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.050
We have this.

92
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.940
Now let's try to add.

93
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.010
On the products cards and see.

94
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.750
Okay.

95
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.670
And now click on click.

96
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.230
Check out and see.

97
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.920
Okay.

98
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.700
Now, you can see we are just having just one product.

99
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.270
Okay.

100
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.610
And that one product I think is going to be the last product we just added.

101
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.430
That is this product and it's not really hard to look at it just to get rid of all this.

102
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.190
And over you click on Delete Collection and all this.

103
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.990
So you see this to the fullest and we can then try this again.

104
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.810
Okay.

105
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.290
It's two cards.

106
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.850
Two cards.

107
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.040
And cuts screen check out.

108
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.610
Okay.

109
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.360
Now click on this clip this and see.

110
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.690
Okay.

111
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.400
You can see we asked The Avengers one.

112
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.020
Product.

113
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.790
And this is going to be the last product you can see.

114
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.840
You can confirm it here.

115
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.600
You can see the item price.

116
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.450
So what is simply doing is it is updating override in this first product.

117
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.840
And the reason for this is what we simply did over here was just.

118
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.690
To create.

119
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.260
What we did is we created a unique single order number.

120
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.800
Okay.

121
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.570
I didn't know if you understand it that way.

122
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.340
We created a single unique or the idea number.

123
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.070
So we are just having just one idea number and that is what we are basically using for all the projects.

124
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.910
Right.

125
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.920
So, you know, that's just solve this error.

126
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.750
We need to get rid of this.

127
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.250
Get rid of this that is just this country and see to copy and then causes.

128
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.510
Then you're going to place this just within the loop.

129
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:32.770
So it also needs Iran a loop over it, or did they generate that or the idea number for each product?

130
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.250
Okay.

131
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.260
Now I'll just start this.

132
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.060
Okay.

133
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:47.540
What we did before is we created a rainbow and we are just having just one unique or the idea number.

134
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.630
Okay, so that was what we were doing before, but now we're going to run a loop in order to have more

135
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.560
than one unique ID number.

136
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.930
Okay.

137
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.850
Or fully understand it that way.

138
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.120
And we can now see if it's gonna work out now and add two cards and.

139
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.480
Add to cart and.

140
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.350
This is a card screen and you can just get rid of this.

141
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.310
Okay.

142
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.420
I think we just have one.

143
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.970
So we're going to be picked in two more.

144
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.980
So not just the walk in and we can click on check out.

145
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.810
Okay, great.

146
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.400
You can see we have two products.

147
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.870
Okay.

148
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.170
Okay.

149
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.400
Sounds good, right?

150
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.080
Okay.

151
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.090
Hopefully in this town by free dance, you can do well to let me know.

152
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.510
Okay?

153
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.100
Okay, guys.

154
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.920
See you in the next lecture.
