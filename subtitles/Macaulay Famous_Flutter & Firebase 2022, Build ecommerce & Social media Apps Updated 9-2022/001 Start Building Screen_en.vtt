00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.589
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.620
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.180
In this lecture, we're going to start building the product detail screen.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.970
Now let's make this cleaner.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:20.160
What we can do is we can create a new folder for this and we're going to create this folder in the views

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.000
directory.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.740
Okay, new folder.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.950
And we're going to call this folder detail.

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:35.060
And within the detail folder, we are then going to create a new file and we're going to call this file

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.010
products on the score detail, on the score screen, and then the section is dot dot.

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.180
And now we can just go with the stateless widget for now.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.390
And since we can upgrade it to the stateful widget, if there is a need, let's widget and product.

13
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.990
Product detail screen.

14
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:10.300
So this screen and over here, we need to highlight and use control dots to import the material that

15
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.350
that's package.

16
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.190
Okay.

17
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:22.810
And we can get rid of this sorry, this container and use a scaffold in order to have access to a lot

18
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.880
of property scaffold.

19
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.720
And for now we can have a body and a centre with jets.

20
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.990
Then inside and it says We jets.

21
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.540
For now it's just going to say detail.

22
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.840
And we need this over there is control needs to save.

23
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.190
And now we have to head back to the product model.

24
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.210
Right.

25
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.890
Because basically we have the design for this over here.

26
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.810
So when we click on this, we want to go to that product detail screen.

27
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.950
To do that, we have to wrap this part in with a button.

28
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.790
Right.

29
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.060
Okay.

30
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.030
A light and use control dots.

31
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.700
Sorry.

32
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:15.590
A light is not wrapped with jets and we can drop this with an inkwell or we can just wrap this with

33
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.780
a gesture detector.

34
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.880
Gesture detector.

35
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.920
And as you know, the gesture detector has a property known as on tap.

36
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.050
And for the on tap, we can then say navigator, dot push.

37
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.480
This will automatically pass the contest and it's asking for the route name.

38
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.800
For the route name.

39
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.790
This is going to be material page route.

40
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.820
Drought.

41
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.990
Paid roots and.

42
00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:00.010
Over here, we have to pass the contest and then we just have to return the product detail.

43
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.980
Sorry.

44
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.280
Details, screen.

45
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.910
And over here, we need a semicolon on here as well.

46
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.350
Okay.

47
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.430
Hover in this to see what we are missing.

48
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.070
And we're missing one additional parenthesis.

49
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.560
To start this now.

50
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.830
Okay.

51
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.670
It's going to take some time to restart and.

52
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.610
It's going to work just fine as expected.

53
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.790
Okay.

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.750
Sorry.

55
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.910
It's taking longer than expected.

56
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.630
Or I'm just going to do this behind the scenes.

57
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.180
See taking longer.

58
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.810
Okay.

59
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.320
So what you just have to do is after you, you log in, you just have to click on this and it's going

60
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.390
to take you to that new screen.

61
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.120
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
