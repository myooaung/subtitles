00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.370
Worker M in the last lecture.

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.330
We created this widget called Circle Animation.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.540
Okay, so now this lecture, we're going to use this widget.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.570
Okay, now to do this, we're going to need to go back to the video screen and now we can use control

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.530
and B to make this work.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.950
Okay.

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.900
Regular reason this right after this column widget, you can see, okay, this column widget and is

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.460
basically for this suit that is the share and this test of here.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.370
Okay.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.630
So right after AIDS, we are going to have the circle.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.880
Circle.

13
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.300
On the mission.

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
You can see now it was just a positive value to that child we have over there.

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.500
Okay.

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.670
So now what we can do is we can have is size books.

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.870
Okay.

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.460
But rather than do it doing it here.

19
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.760
What we can do is we can commit this for now.

20
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.980
So we are going to be able to format our code.

21
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.340
Okay.

22
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.240
We can commit this.

23
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.070
And over here.

24
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.090
Okay.

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.099
Before the override, they're going to have they're going to create a function.

26
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.660
Yes.

27
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.290
And we can call this function build music.

28
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Music album album.

29
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.490
You can basically call this anything you desire, and over year you're going to pass in the five foot

30
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.940
two away efforts and we can specify the guitar type.

31
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.220
It is a type of string and now we can return.

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.650
We can return what is sized books.

33
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.860
You can see the size books or something similar like that of the container this size books.

34
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.900
And we're going to give the size bus a hard so you can see we as we'll have the height property we can

35
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.850
give it CC and weight of 60 as well.

36
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.290
Okay.

37
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.870
And now we can then have inside.

38
00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.770
Okay.

39
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.520
I think we need a semicolon since this is the hand of this code.

40
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.850
Okay.

41
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.410
And the child is going to be a column which is.

42
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.020
Hello Widgets.

43
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.470
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets as this.

44
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.240
Okay.

45
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.130
Now the first chart can also be a size box.

46
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.980
Since we still need to have access to the height and width.

47
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.570
And as you know, the height and width is also available in the size box.

48
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.420
So we can as well use a size box.

49
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.930
But the problem is we need to tie.

50
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.260
Like have some rounded shape around the image.

51
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.140
I know that to have that we need to style it.

52
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.470
Right.

53
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.830
Okay.

54
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.200
And the problem is the size box does not have any property like decoration.

55
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.940
Okay, so for this purpose, we're gonna need what's a container?

56
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.310
So you can see there's a major difference between a size box and a container.

57
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.430
The containers also have the height property and as well the width property, but the container has

58
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.540
the decoration and which the size box does not have.

59
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.080
Okay, so now you're going to be given the width of the image that says we're going to have an image,

60
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.700
then we want some roundish shape around that image.

61
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.100
Okay.

62
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.050
So we're going to say 50 and.

63
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.180
Heights of 50 as well.

64
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.170
Okay.

65
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.280
And like I said, we can then have the decoration.

66
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.400
And that's the reason we have to use the container.

67
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.100
It's just not available in this size box.

68
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.600
If not, we can just as well use it has most of the case size like embossed decoration.

69
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.280
And now what we can do is we can have sucralose within the image.

70
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.690
Okay.

71
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.010
So now that we have multiple colors, again, going to is something known as gradients.

72
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.690
And this is the way linea.

73
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.450
Linea gradient.

74
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.650
Okay.

75
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.900
This is going to take some list of colors that we have in the list of our as we can now be true comma

76
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.190
and is constraint necessary.

77
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.360
Okay.

78
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.670
Now different color is going to be colors.

79
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.560
That's grey.

80
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.140
Hopefully now against big gray.

81
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.339
And the second colors because that's whites.

82
00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.510
Okay, great.

83
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.330
And what we can do is we can add it our via so we know where it ends.

84
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.580
Okay.

85
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.700
Now it's in the box.

86
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.680
Decoration.

87
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.070
We can give this container.

88
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.010
If we can make it a bit rounded.

89
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.460
So we tend to buzz decoration outside this.

90
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.080
Okay, we can then have the butter but a videos and this is going to put a reduced.

91
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.810
The circle are for all sides.

92
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.030
We can say 24 and added Shaniqua out of my youth contract SSA.

93
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.540
Okay.

94
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.320
And now we can within the sorry, outside the box decoration within the container, we can then have

95
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.830
a child.

96
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.470
And you can even do it over here.

97
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.070
You can also have the child over here, like I said, must be within the container.

98
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.610
Okay.

99
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.210
Okay.

100
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.420
You can see we can't save because we have this error, and that's the reason we have to commit this

101
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.290
house.

102
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.710
Okay.

103
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.240
Okay.

104
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.330
And over here we can have the child and the child is going to be something known as clip.

105
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.090
All right.

106
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:43.450
What is with the is it we give some roundish shape around our image clip our it's arrow double arrows

107
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.450
to take note of that and we can as we have the border radius to make sure it is clipped.

108
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.390
To make sure it is clipped around and whether it is a secular.

109
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.930
Of 24 as well.

110
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.100
So it's a four and a value added trachoma.

111
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:09.230
And within the clip it it has a property known as child and the child is going to be image.

112
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.980
We can just basically say image, that's network.

113
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.580
You can see this the short form and pass in that dynamic Facebook profile.

114
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.710
For two.

115
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.380
Right.

116
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.840
The key.

117
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.710
Okay.

118
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.340
Provide for this.

119
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.800
Okay.

120
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.830
Profi.

121
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.390
Rule five foot two.

122
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.860
Okay.

123
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.830
None of the long courts is to say image.

124
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.180
So image.

125
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.280
You can see that it was the property image and you can see network.

126
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.890
Image.

127
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.270
Okay, it is the long form.

128
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.050
AK So any tank, is we just going to go with that?

129
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.900
Image.

130
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.490
That's what network.

131
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.010
Okay.

132
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.560
Now for the source within the past in the profile footer.

133
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.530
Later when we call called that's.

134
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.240
Function going to need to pass on the value to.

135
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.810
Okay.

136
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.410
Now what we can do is add a useful finesse to save.

137
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.250
Okay.

138
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.950
Okay.

139
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.120
Now, this image, that network as a property in the last few years, you're going to see BuzzFeed's.

140
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.890
BuzzFeed's that cover.

141
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:34.320
What this would do is it will make the image covers the entire container.

142
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.820
Okay.

143
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.050
Okay.

144
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.580
Great.

145
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.280
And.

146
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.860
Now we can then or.

147
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.960
That's.

148
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.530
Okay.

149
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.140
So all we can do now is uncomment this.

150
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.440
And for the child is going to be now the dude.

151
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.550
Music.

152
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.330
Hopefully this is a spelling album and it was an easy tip.

153
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.320
Image rights.

154
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.600
Or it was a network image.

155
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.380
We can see.

156
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.140
It was a network image.

157
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.400
You can see the image of the network.

158
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.940
So we need to pass in something to Zippy and so on.

159
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.560
But what we can do, since we don't have it now, we can just type four five footer.

160
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.690
So we know later we're going to need to parse that.

161
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.080
Okay.

162
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.660
How did you know you're going to get an error and this error is going to crash.

163
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.450
You'll have no notice of that from crashing.

164
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.309
You'll have all you can do is go to this and you're going to see something like this.

165
00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.260
Make sure you check this.

166
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.680
All the sessions are called exceptions.

167
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.840
Just make sure you check everything away.

168
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.580
But you're still going to get that error.

169
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:56.870
But this time around is going to get thrown at your the book to read off from crashing you'll have okay

170
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.090
so this is basically it.

171
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.410
And now we can haaz we start this.

172
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.850
Or to start this.

173
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.020
Or to start this.

174
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.070
Or three stages.

175
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.440
Or two stages and.

176
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.170
And.

177
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.620
And.

178
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.150
And.

179
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.630
And.

180
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.080
And.

181
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.500
And.

182
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.900
And and okay that's going to take some time to reload the have.

183
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.670
Okay.

184
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.640
Okay, okay.

185
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:26.660
It's not.

186
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.260
Take us now.

187
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.060
It's okay.

188
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.760
You can sit.

189
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.490
You can see it over here.

190
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.830
Okay.

191
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.860
Now all we can do is.

192
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.380
Okay.

193
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.520
Now, what's the key?

194
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.640
You can see over here is going to explain this for you again.

195
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.380
Over here we have.

196
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.490
The size box.

197
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.090
The size box is generally for this of a year.

198
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.820
And we're giving the heart to 60 and we to 60.

199
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.770
And this is basically what you're saying over and over.

200
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:07.930
We have a concern that as well, given the container width of 50 and the height of 50, this 50, we

201
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:08.620
are offensive.

202
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:16.600
But with this 50, my friend, about this, the 54, the image, the key, more like we are happy on

203
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.660
the six again inside this top circle.

204
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.000
I don't know if you understand this, but later on I think you can understand this.

205
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.050
Okay, now you can visibly get rid of all this and just do it.

206
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.550
Copy of it in the way.

207
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.050
And it ends here, and you just.

208
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.480
Get rid of this.

209
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.810
Gets rid of this, right?

210
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.580
Get rid of this.

211
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.790
And his state is still going to be the same thing.

212
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.440
But there's sort of this.

213
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.640
We can just go ahead and.

214
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:59.350
Tell the network in marriage and dramatic food and see the dissenting voice just to make our code more

215
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.670
concise so we don't feel this created with loss of quotes.

216
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.950
That's why we needed to create its.

217
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.610
Over.

218
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:15.910
Over a year right now, in case you see this and other causes, you should then be able to understand.

219
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.380
Okay.

220
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.170
Okay, guys, I think this is basically it seems good, right?

221
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.600
Okay.

222
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.980
Okay.

223
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.110
See the structure?
