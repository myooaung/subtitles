00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.780
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.350
Walker In this lecture, we are going to start working on a new section for the category section.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.540
We are going to do that later in the course.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.140
Okay.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.570
Now, to start working on the new IRA section, the first thing you are going to need to do is to go

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.710
back to the good.

7
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.450
Now it's obvious much more clinical.

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.210
We are also going to create a new fly over this.

9
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.590
We get territory.

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.960
And you're gonna call this fi category on the score list then dot that.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.920
Okay.

12
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.580
Now you're going to need to use go through and we to make this wide.

13
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.800
This business is not going to change.

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.760
We can use a stateless widget as well.

15
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.310
You can call this category list that over you.

16
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.450
We need to highlight and use control and ods in order to import the material that that's why.

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.380
Okay.

18
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.590
Now, although I've finished up, you can see we have to remain.

19
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.430
We jet over here.

20
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.900
That is the test we get.

21
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.360
The test we get and the icon widget and these two widgets have been displayed horizontally.

22
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.110
That is from left to right.

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.160
So I see no record abusing the widget court rule.

24
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.290
Okay, so now what?

25
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.840
Each side of the container is going to be a row widgets, right.

26
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.830
And as you know, a Roman that can take multiple widgets.

27
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.510
So it's as this to it.

28
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.060
Okay.

29
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.360
Now, the first child we are going to need is a test widget, right?

30
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.970
The first test is just going to say, New River, you can give his thigh to this.

31
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.770
Just I.

32
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.310
We can give a font size that is our bigger is going to be a font size of 22.

33
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.120
Then we can give you fonts with this.

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.000
That is fonts with.

35
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.360
Dodds Bert.

36
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.289
Okay.

37
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.990
Now you can then use control and associate.

38
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.790
Then.

39
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.880
We can then go to our own.

40
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.100
For the.

41
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.720
So you're not unaffordable, Phi Phi then that we can import the category.

42
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.640
List.

43
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.110
Right.

44
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.530
Okay.

45
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.160
This area then is controlled as a safe and good check what you just did.

46
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.810
Okay.

47
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.980
You going to sit here now?

48
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.550
Right.

49
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.450
Okay.

50
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.470
You're going to see the.

51
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.210
Okay.

52
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.780
Great.

53
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.590
Now the second thing that we need is a test we get right is also a test widget that is this view of.

54
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.680
Of you.

55
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.900
We can just call her as city your.

56
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.730
Okay.

57
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.320
So we're going to go back to the category list.

58
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.810
Okay.

59
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.170
Then we're going to need to have another test we get.

60
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.860
So sorry.

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.160
You can see this is the first test we get and it's yet that is why I always need to go to all this other

62
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.490
training.

63
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.040
Okay, I've tried this.

64
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.710
Okay.

65
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.120
Then.

66
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.080
Now we can have another test.

67
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.740
Right.

68
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.130
Which is just going to say you.

69
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.100
Okay.

70
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.840
I'm trying to save a good check.

71
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.200
Okay.

72
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.390
Now the next widget we're going to need is this Harrow, right?

73
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.050
Okay.

74
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.890
So after this test, we did as well.

75
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.830
We're going to need the chain of command.

76
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.460
Then we're just going to use a container so we have access to more properties.

77
00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:03.990
Then the child is going to be, as I call widgets for the icon is going to be icons dot arrow or this

78
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.010
go forward.

79
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.690
I think for what it's called, I always think great concern is going save and go check it out.

80
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.340
Okay.

81
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.270
Is that right?

82
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.100
Now we can use.

83
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.570
Is going to break this down.

84
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.880
You can use Maine as I meant.

85
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.710
Maine, us I alignment.

86
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.130
Made us this alignment.

87
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.140
The space between.

88
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.370
Okay, are the change.

89
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.440
Come and go see what it does.

90
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.190
Okay.

91
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.300
Now, you can see it is way too far from issue there.

92
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.690
Right.

93
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.530
Okay.

94
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.280
So what we can do is instead of this.

95
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.810
We can get rid of this too, just with that.

96
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.990
Okay.

97
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.330
Okay.

98
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.860
The first one is you're right.

99
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.030
Get rid of it.

100
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.620
And the second.

101
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.330
And you're right.

102
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.410
Okay.

103
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.370
Get rid of it.

104
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.970
Okay.

105
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.150
I'm just going to give.

106
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.070
Sorry, is country and.

107
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.380
Okay, I'm just gonna do this.

108
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.310
So if I said, well, are you going to get rid of this?

109
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.880
Tests.

110
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.980
We get the second and this.

111
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.330
Okay.

112
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.740
So it is.

113
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.740
It's right.

114
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.520
So now what we can do within the RO widgets, we can add another rule.

115
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.620
Okay.

116
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.390
Another rule.

117
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.390
We just duke it out.

118
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.990
The children.

119
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.160
Right.

120
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.450
Okay, great.

121
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.520
And over a year we can then have the first we get.

122
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.110
Which is just going to say you are.

123
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.130
View.

124
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.700
Okay.

125
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.930
Good.

126
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.050
Then we're going to have the second widget, which is going to be an icon widget, like I said.

127
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.880
That's our system of privacy.

128
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.560
We're going to need a container.

129
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.580
Container.

130
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.220
Okay, then the child.

131
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.730
Then we're going to have the High Court, which adds.

132
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.660
Then it's going to be I cause.

133
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.610
I cause arrow.

134
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.800
Arrow on this car forward.

135
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.620
This guy is controlling this the save.

136
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.240
And you're going to see this.

137
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.940
Okay.

138
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.760
You can see it is now very close compared to before.

139
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.890
So we are in a role.

140
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.830
If I start raising their role inside the role.

141
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:47.840
So then this is just going to start from the last widget instead of giving such huge space.

142
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.020
Right.

143
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.030
Okay, great.

144
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.390
Now, what you're going to do is you're going to try to tie this arrow to look.

145
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.830
So for that, going to try to style this area safe to look exactly like this.

146
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.390
You've seen this before.

147
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.530
I think he can do this.

148
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.510
So try.

149
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.610
It is similar to decide to try to do.

150
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.200
Yes.

151
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.300
Right.

152
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.730
So try to make this arrow.

153
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.820
That is your assignment.

154
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.670
Try to make this arrow.

155
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.100
This are where I think you.

156
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.630
They look just exactly like this.

157
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.070
Well, before then, they're going to give some students a space between the edges.

158
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.580
Okay.

159
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.660
Let's do that.

160
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.810
Where they are, they concerned is right.

161
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.190
So we can have a project.

162
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.300
It's going to be edge.

163
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.530
Edge inserts darts hall.

164
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.160
Okay.

165
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.330
All we can say is that the symmetric.

166
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.020
Okay.

167
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.950
Then what you're going to say first is or isn't the eurozone to us to do with the left or right?

168
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.720
That is, we are just trying to say we want to give space between the left and the right.

169
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:07.020
So, once again, space between the left and the right of 25 that we can see Vertica.

170
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.900
The Vertica out to do it top to bottom.

171
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.140
That is once again a space from this top.

172
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.880
So the bottom is going to go 25 from the top.

173
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.720
Okay.

174
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:26.170
So for the Vertica, because as I'll say, 25 year contract, this is safe and good.

175
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:26.760
Check it out.

176
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.640
Is going to come down and we will be in that space.

177
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.110
Okay, great.

178
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.400
So now the segment is trying to make this icon look similar to this.

179
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.090
Okay.

180
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.409
Okay, guys.

181
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.190
See you.
