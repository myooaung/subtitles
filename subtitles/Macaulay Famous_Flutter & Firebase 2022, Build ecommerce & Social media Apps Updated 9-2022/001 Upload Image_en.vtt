00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.470
In this lecture, we are going to be able to store the picked image in the Firebase Storage.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.970
Okay?

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.580
And I know that to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VTS code and then the auto controller

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.330
file.

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.750
Okay.

8
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.400
Now, what we can do is we can use control and bits and make this wide.

9
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.860
Now, over here, you can see we basically have four major fields.

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.380
That is the image field, the full name field, the email field and the password field.

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.850
So we send the sign up.

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.570
Users function over this parenthesis.

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.940
We can have the trailer comma and then pass.

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.840
The image field.

15
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.630
And definitely we are going to have this error.

16
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.960
And the reason for this error, you can see over here we are calling the sign up user function and over

17
00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.080
here we passed in four variables and we are only able to pass in serial values to it.

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.350
So that is why we are having that error because it's basically looking for that additional value.

19
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.670
Okay.

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.810
So.

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.300
Yeah.

22
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190
We can specify the type.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.370
This is a type of something that's you and.

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.990
Eight.

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.790
Least.

26
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.370
And we can say it can be nor.

27
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.960
And within the statement, we can as well have some check.

28
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.640
But before then we are basically saying if the field, if the full name is not empty and the email is

29
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.730
not empty and the password is not empty, then only we want to create the user with the email and password

30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.830
and we also want to store the details of the user to the cloud for a store database.

31
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.170
Okay.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.830
Great.

33
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.850
And we can also have some check over for the emails so we can then say and.

34
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.250
Image.

35
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.910
Is not equal to nor.

36
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.660
Okay.

37
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.220
So now we're basically saying if the funding is not empty, the image is not empty, the passport is

38
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.030
not empty and the image is not equal to that is if the user picked the image then only wants to create

39
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.110
this user.

40
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.680
But as well we are not just only going to be able to store the full name and email, but we are also

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.020
going to be able to store the pics image.

42
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.530
Right?

43
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.830
So over here before we store the image, we're going to first need to upload it to the storage.

44
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.300
So we can create a functional barrier and we can make this function private because we don't want to

45
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.360
be able to assess this function as this file.

46
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.870
So you can see on this core upload image to storage.

47
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.420
And we have to pass the image line to make this code a bit more cleaner.

48
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.740
We are not going to create the functional barrier so we can copy this.

49
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.060
We can copy this.

50
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.400
I think we need a semicolon.

51
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.950
And over here we can just add a comment.

52
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.310
And we can say function.

53
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.780
Function to.

54
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.100
Upload.

55
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.750
Pics.

56
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.590
Image to the.

57
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.560
Sturridge.

58
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.300
Okay.

59
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.520
In our business function via.

60
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.460
Okay.

61
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.320
And as well we can specify this is a type of but most of the time we don't really need to specify.

62
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.120
You ain't.

63
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.250
Aides list.

64
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.570
At least, and we can say it can be now.

65
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.810
Okay.

66
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.830
And now we're going to need access to the storage rights.

67
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.120
And we are the store that's package that is the.

68
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.920
The Firebase Storage.

69
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.000
So we're going to need to import this.

70
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.970
So back to the old controller file.

71
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.300
Back over a year.

72
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.430
We can then say finer.

73
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.130
Phoner and we can just go ahead and specify the type of variable.

74
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.740
This is a type of Firebase Storage, and we can call this underscore Firebase Storage.

75
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.050
It's going to be equal to Firebase.

76
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.040
Sturridge.

77
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.730
Storage, for instance.

78
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.840
Okay, great.

79
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.880
And now the first step is to upload.

80
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.610
Sorry.

81
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.510
The first step is to create a folder where all our profile images are going to be stored.

82
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.920
In order to do this, we're going to key to this variable.

83
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.850
We have a.

84
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.280
So over here we can say on the score, firebase.

85
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.110
Firebase Storage Dots Ref.

86
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.020
The child.

87
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.230
And this first child is referring to the name of the father for the name of the father.

88
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.150
We are going to call this profile.

89
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.920
We can just say profiles.

90
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.520
Okay.

91
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.040
And now we can say that child again.

92
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.760
Now, this child is basically referring to what the name of the image should be.

93
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.250
Now the name of the image is going to be the user uid.

94
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.080
So in order to do that, you can see we have the screen over here.

95
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.270
But we basically can't use the screen since the variable is.

96
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.820
Below.

97
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.880
What we have is we can't we can't call this viable.

98
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.250
So what we can do, we can use the.

99
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.990
Firebase.

100
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.540
What's available so we can say on the score art.

101
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:12.750
Dodds wants to get the current user ID which is currently creating the accounts and Dot's UID and had

102
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.850
a no check via.

103
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.770
So the name of the folder where all our images are going to be stored is going to be called profiles.

104
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:28.200
Then each user image is going to be the UID like this over here and we can store the results in a variable

105
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.270
called ref.

106
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.620
And this is a type of something known as reference.

107
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.780
We fair?

108
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.930
We fear for the conspiracy referrals.

109
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.080
Okay.

110
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.780
Referrals.

111
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.410
Okay.

112
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.250
We need to import it.

113
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.080
Concur and.

114
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.240
No code.

115
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.880
That's incredible.

116
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.050
It's important.

117
00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.980
I'm sure.

118
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.560
And.

119
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:02.010
Okay.

120
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.450
We're just going to continue.

121
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.300
I think I'm going to be able to keep watch.

122
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.910
Sorry.

123
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:07.500
Okay.

124
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.060
Ref.

125
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.990
Okay.

126
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.770
Great.

127
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.850
And now the next step is to upload this.

128
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.780
Profile image that is the perfect image to the cloud.

129
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.850
So not to the cloud faster, but to the storage.

130
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.810
Okay.

131
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.540
So now in order to do that, we are going to call this rainbow graph and we're going to need to say

132
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.680
dot put.

133
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.170
Puts data.

134
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.650
And we're going to need to pass in the image.

135
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.210
And over here, we need another check.

136
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.990
So.

137
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.260
Great.

138
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:52.440
And we can store the results of the uploaded image in a variable called upload.

139
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.790
Upload task.

140
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.650
And this is a type of most of the time you just have to memorize all this process.

141
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.380
But definitely there are different way to do this.

142
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.480
But I think this would be the best way.

143
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.550
Okay, great.

144
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.020
And what we have to do is we're going to need to wait for the uploading.

145
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.840
And in order to use the weight, we need to use the single via.

146
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.230
So we can then say our weight is going to be upload.

147
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.560
Upload task.

148
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.370
This dribble we have.

149
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:37.539
And finally, we can store the final results in the rainbow called Task.

150
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.110
Tax short.

151
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.030
Thaksin I'm short and you can say snap.

152
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.270
Okay.

153
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.960
Great.

154
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.540
So we started to rebel in the West, basically starting the resort.

155
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.490
So in the rebel cold snap and this is a type of stock snapshot.

156
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.070
Like I said, most of the time you just have to memorize the process.

157
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:11.400
Okay, now this is basically all we need in order to upload an image to the storage.

158
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.820
But as well, we are not just going to be able to upload this image and the storage, but we are also

159
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:24.750
going to be able to retrieve this image from the storage and then upload it over here as a field.

160
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.410
So we're going to have the image field and we're going to upload it over here.

161
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.960
Now, in order to do this, we're going to need to retrieve the image, right?

162
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.010
And to do that, all we just have to say is I wait.

163
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:39.940
And.

164
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.970
There's going to be snap this rainbow over there.

165
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:51.410
Snap the ref dot gets the load URL.

166
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.160
Okay, and we can store the downloaded URL.

167
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.100
That is the image you have to.

168
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.930
A verbal wish we can cor download.

169
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.430
So.

170
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:16.840
Download URL, and since this is a URL, this is definitely going to be a type of string.

171
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.800
And finally we can return.

172
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.110
Return.

173
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.950
Return.

174
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.660
Hopefully I can spare return.

175
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.560
Download the URL.

176
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.460
Okay.

177
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.120
This is basically all we need.

178
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.050
Great.

179
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.810
And now we can then store that image as a field of view.

180
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.450
To do that over here, what we have to do.

181
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:53.830
We have to stop this inevitable dysfunction in the V.A. So we're going to say it's equal to that load.

182
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.290
The URL.

183
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.770
And this is the type of string.

184
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.660
And we can just await this because it will definitely take some time.

185
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.220
And now we can then say image.

186
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.760
Sorry.

187
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.330
Image and.

188
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.260
That load.

189
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.790
You are well.

190
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.750
Okay.

191
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.060
Okay, great.

192
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.220
Now, this is basically it.

193
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.990
And now we can use that function.

194
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.250
Sorry, we can use.

195
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.170
We can pass the value to it.

196
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.510
Therefore the value.

197
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:44.670
Okay, so we can have the semicolon and for the value, it's going to be the global variable which we

198
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:50.520
had over here, whereby the global variable basically had us have access to the pigs image.

199
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.090
Right.

200
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.020
So this is going to be on the score.

201
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.840
Image.

202
00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.400
And I think we have.

203
00:11:59.460 --> 00:11:59.970
Okay.

204
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.870
That's all.

205
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.150
Okay.

206
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:10.630
Now, if you've forgotten what this image is, you can just go back to the previous lecture.

207
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.550
Okay.

208
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.650
And this is basically all we need so we can give this an all street start.

209
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.240
And we're going to try to come back to this again.

210
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.520
Now we have the fossil fuels which we have via.

211
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.080
So.

212
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.660
The image, the full name, the email and the password.

213
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.200
You can see we all have those four fields over here.

214
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:45.000
You can see we have the forces over here and basically we are.

215
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.630
Passing the value to it.

216
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.980
For the full name.

217
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.250
It's going to be the full name controller test.

218
00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.480
That is, whatever the user pays into this is going to be assigned to that full name variable we had

219
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.140
over there.

220
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.930
And same as the email.

221
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.340
The email.

222
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.040
Field and as well as the password.

223
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.030
Field for the image field, it's going to be whatever that is for this image field.

224
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.480
We have a.

225
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.210
We have a buyer.

226
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.260
It's going to be whatever the user picks.

227
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.820
Okay.

228
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.510
Great.

229
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.550
And now we can just try this out.

230
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.650
I think I've spent a lot of time.

231
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.820
I'm just going to leave you to try this out yourself.

232
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.920
Then after you do, you're going to need to check your storage and.

233
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:43.860
You're going to see it over here.

234
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.160
And as well, you're going to need to refresh this and you're going to see over here.

235
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.900
Okay.

236
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.990
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
