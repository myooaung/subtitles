1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.250
Just to widgets horizontally, that is from left to right.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.320
So within the column we can then have a row widget and as we know, a row can take multiple widgets

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.900
which are going to be displayed horizontally.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.680
Okay, sorry.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.730
I think we need this.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.220
And now we can have it as widgets.

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.920
This is going to be order.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.800
And I think we have a field known as other prize and it is a number.

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.350
So we have to convert this to a string and maybe ask us first.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.320
Most of the time you don't get what's a prediction.

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.750
You can just do this yourself.

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.260
Okay?

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.730
You should see it right over here.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.820
Double has nominated a string.

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.800
It's a string.

16
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.260
The string.

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.670
US fist.

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.180
We're just going to do this.

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.340
Okay.

20
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.790
Sorry, we have to pass the to to tell how many zero we basically want.

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.200
Sorry for that.

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.720
Okay.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.370
Okay.

24
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.120
Sims Cool.

25
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
And within the column, we can then say cross assessment.

26
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.140
Cross assessment.

27
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.430
The start.

28
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.850
Okay.

29
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.910
And also we tend to grow.

30
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.990
We can say main assess element mean us.

31
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.810
Meet us at the space between.

32
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.020
Okay.

33
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.490
And we can format this by having a trained camera.

34
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.460
And I as well.

35
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.040
And that's why.

36
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.980
Okay.

37
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.550
Cisco.

38
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.700
And also, we can tie this.

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.720
So we can have a test.

40
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.540
Style.

41
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.240
Color.

42
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.550
Kohler's third sign.

43
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.280
Okay.

44
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.040
Okay.

45
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.750
Most of the time you do not really need to follow me.

46
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.650
You can just go with your own style.

47
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.710
Some school.

48
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.780
And.

49
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.900
And lastly, we can display the quantity so we can have on that test.

50
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.700
I think we have.

51
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.390
I think we call this other quantity.

52
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.580
Make sure you don't have any spell.

53
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.300
Mistake.

54
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.010
Quantity.

55
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.750
Quantity.

56
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.550
Okay.

57
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.390
And also we have to convert this to a string because it is a number.

58
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.560
Okay.

59
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.980
Where do you have that space between?

60
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.540
Okay, consider where and what we can, just as we can get rid of this and use this.

61
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.260
Right.

62
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.190
Basically, the reason for this is because we want to use a test and a variable.

63
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.790
So we have to use this.

64
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.710
We can say this, okay, and this is going to be order.

65
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.050
So in order to assess the variable, we need to use a dollar sign order.

66
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.790
And other.

67
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.050
Quantity.

68
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.110
And also, we have to convert this.

69
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.080
So where does the string add your cover?

70
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.960
How do you cover?

71
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.360
Okay.

72
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.410
By state.

73
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.140
I think we made this mistake.

74
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.690
One.

75
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.800
I'm just going to check this.

76
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.580
Q.

77
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.430
U.

78
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.350
N.

79
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.930
Q.

80
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.410
Q.

81
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.550
Q.

82
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.410
Q.

83
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.670
And make sure we don't.

84
00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.510
Q.

85
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.400
Q.

86
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.160
Q.

87
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.380
Q.

88
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.810
Q.

89
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960
And this should be correct.

90
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.670
Okay.

91
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay.

92
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.690
Sounds cool.

93
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.320
And you can just add your own style to display the best products.

94
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.940
In the next lecture, we are going to continue.

95
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.650
Okay, guys.

96
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.760
In this lecture.
