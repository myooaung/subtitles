00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.920
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.210
In this lecture, regular displayed the products for each categories.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.510
Okay, then know that to do this, we're going to need to go to the design for each category.

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.260
That is the category item five.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.720
Okay.

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.770
Now we can then use control and be in that to make this slide.

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.160
Okay.

9
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.680
Now the first step we are going to need to take is they're going to make all this clickable.

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.100
Okay.

11
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.690
Now to do that over this container, we can add lights and then use control and dots and wrap with widgets.

12
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.740
Are going to rob this with the gesture detector.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.170
And as you know, the gesture detector has a privacy card on tap.

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.800
Okay, we can just create this function.

15
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.270
Okay, great.

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.530
Now the next step is when a user clicks on this host category.

17
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.330
We are going to take that user.

18
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.810
So in your screen, where just falls are going to be displayed.

19
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.200
Okay.

20
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.250
Now, to do this, they're going to need to create a new fee for this.

21
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.890
So over the screens dietary, we are going to create a new PHI and we can simply just call this FY fields.

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.830
This car.

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.510
Category then.

24
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.730
That's.

25
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.500
That's okay.

26
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.900
And we can just use our fields.

27
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.070
Okay.

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.460
So.

29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.210
We can just use our film screen design so we can use contrast.

30
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.270
So I light in control and see to copy.

31
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.200
And then there is this.

32
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.810
And we can change the name to.

33
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.280
He feels.

34
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.600
Category.

35
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.360
Can just call this fierce category.

36
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.410
Great.

37
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.780
Okay, great.

38
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.200
Now let's go back to the cards.

39
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.740
Item designs, cred.

40
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.480
So the category.

41
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.710
Okay.

42
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.400
The category item that is designed for each category.

43
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.790
Okay.

44
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.100
Now, the next step we are going to need to take is we're going to pass.

45
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.380
This category name.

46
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.460
So the nest roots, that is the roots you are going to be navigating that's user to.

47
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.900
Okay.

48
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.510
Now to do this so pass this data this category name data.

49
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.890
It has sped the navigation, so be it type of push name.

50
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.280
Okay.

51
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.760
So now what I to do is we're going to do this, which you've seen before.

52
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.380
I think we did it for detail, right.

53
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.720
Because we're going to do the same thing.

54
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.670
So we're going to go back to the.

55
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.150
The first category.

56
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.880
Then over a year you're going to say static.

57
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.480
Costs shrink.

58
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.970
And we can give this idea, we can give this idea and we can give this roots a name.

59
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.110
We can call this.

60
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.310
Fields he Jussie Smollett are fields.

61
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.790
Category screen.

62
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.100
Okay.

63
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.580
Great.

64
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.960
Nice country.

65
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.660
Necessary.

66
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.100
Okay.

67
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.900
Now you're going to need us to define this in the main, the dat fi.

68
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.500
Okay.

69
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.890
We're not going to do The Simpsons movie Fields.

70
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.700
Skills category screen.

71
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.620
I'd.

72
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.560
Dan?

73
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.700
He's going to take the contest and then.

74
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.930
The fields.

75
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.900
Fields category screen.

76
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.810
Okay, great.

77
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.690
Great.

78
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.600
Now we're going to need to go back to the design for each category.

79
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.570
That's the category item.

80
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.620
Okay.

81
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.440
There's the wire.

82
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.880
And now we can then use control and be like, Yeah, we can now say, Nah, the kids are.

83
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.040
Dad's push name you have.

84
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.650
You can still use that off contest the same ten.

85
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.660
Or we can just say that push them.

86
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.970
You can see it as well as the contest.

87
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.589
Okay.

88
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.579
Then just gonna be.

89
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.630
Fields.

90
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.170
Screen.

91
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.210
That's it.

92
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.870
Okay.

93
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.050
This culture and this are just let's just take this.

94
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.030
Okay.

95
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.170
Okay.

96
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.530
Okay.

97
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.920
Okay.

98
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.280
Okay.

99
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.670
Okay.

100
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.110
Okay.

101
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.580
Okay.

102
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.540
Now click on this.

103
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.210
Okay, I think.

104
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.940
Okay.

105
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.430
Cassie.

106
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.360
Sorry.

107
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.510
This have to go back on this.

108
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.830
Okay.

109
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.550
You can see now what you're going to need to do is when when the user clicks on this, only the false

110
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.480
ability of this fade.

111
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.840
Okay.

112
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.800
Now, to do this, they're going to need to send data to this.

113
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.060
Screen over year.

114
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.360
So this screen.

115
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.710
Okay.

116
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.320
So in order to do that, this push name has a property known as documents.

117
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.710
Okay.

118
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.230
Now we can simply just pass in that category.

119
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.460
This over here.

120
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.350
Copy this.

121
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.720
And.

122
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.950
So sorry.

123
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.420
Not Dad's.

124
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.570
This applies to the category name.

125
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.950
Okay.

126
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.470
Okay.

127
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.000
Sorry.

128
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.990
Culture and see.

129
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.490
And.

130
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.310
You can then pass this.

131
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.230
I take?

132
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.880
Okay.

133
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.180
As well.

134
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.510
We need this.

135
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.380
Okay, great.

136
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.760
Now, if you've forgotten what this does, you can as well just go to the design.

137
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.270
We did design part for each category.

138
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.360
Right.

139
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.410
So you can just go to the lecture board.

140
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.160
You are simply doing it.

141
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.040
We are passing.

142
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.360
The category name, too.

143
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.340
That's Korean, right?

144
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.690
And over here you can see we have passed the index.

145
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.950
The dance is different to each item, right?

146
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.920
That is the watch is the shoes.

147
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.700
That is what you visit.

148
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.270
The passive.

149
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.690
Okay.

150
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.320
Now the necessary to do this is to save.

151
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.720
And you're going to need to go to.

152
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.950
The.

153
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.340
The details.

154
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.720
Sorry.

155
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.500
The fields.

156
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880
The I think we call this.

157
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.020
Fields category, everything to come to this fly in order to accept those data.

158
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.500
Okay, now to accept it, all we just have to do is.

159
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.110
Within a year, you're going to create a finite variable.

160
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.250
And as we're going to call this, I'm going to call this category name.

161
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.610
We're going to equites you.

162
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.510
Model.

163
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.250
Model.

164
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.030
Model results.

165
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.430
Sorry.

166
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.350
Dots of contests.

167
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.490
Dots.

168
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.920
Settings then dot arguments that it's all just steps that value and are going to say as.

169
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.420
US shrink.

170
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.730
Okay.

171
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.810
Shrank.

172
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.280
Okay.

173
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.940
So what we can then do is we can add this way.

174
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.560
Okay, great.

175
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.970
So we are simply accepting that data we just passed.

176
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.480
Okay.

177
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.360
Okay, I think.

178
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.300
Category item.

179
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.230
This data.

180
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.150
So the data can be the phones, the shoes and others.

181
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.420
Okay.

182
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:26.780
Right.

183
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.160
Okay.

184
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.750
So you're going to go back to this.

185
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.159
His category.

186
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.470
In Watts, you can just then do what you can just do is we can cut this off from yeah let's see and

187
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.049
delete then paste this so.

188
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.390
Then, Piers, this.

189
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.130
After.

190
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:50.960
Okay.

191
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.580
Now we can get rid of this and.

192
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.170
Make it finer.

193
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.490
Okay.

194
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.300
Then instead of this, you can then see.

195
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.160
The dots.

196
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.300
Fine by category and past in the category name.

197
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:09.900
Okay.

198
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.500
You can see.

199
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.770
Get rid of this in this country.

200
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.450
Unnecessary.

201
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.080
So this category name is simply words.

202
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.930
We are using this model roots to assets, this data we just passed.

203
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.470
So I think.

204
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.640
The fields are ten.

205
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.350
Right.

206
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.880
So I isn't that model name.

207
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.330
So I suppose this data which could be phones, shoes and other.

208
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.980
Okay, well, I'm just gonna show you distressed.

209
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.880
So all we can do is we can print it out first.

210
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.280
Okay?

211
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.820
So.

212
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.630
Okay, we're going to go back to the first category.

213
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:05.650
So instead of this all we can just say parents category name.

214
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.720
Okay.

215
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.850
The case culture and this.

216
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.960
And new seminar.

217
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:19.790
Okay.

218
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.470
I think.

219
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.290
Via.

220
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.310
String is.

221
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.480
Okay, let's see.

222
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.310
So it's start again.

223
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.460
Okay.

224
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.040
Okay.

225
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:48.430
Okay.

226
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.960
Now click on this.

227
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.400
Okay.

228
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.970
You can see.

229
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.320
You can see.

230
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.900
Right.

231
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.700
And.

232
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.510
Right.

233
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:03.930
Okay.

234
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.110
Great.

235
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.010
So you can see your phones gonna be displayed.

236
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.580
Okay, so all you can do, I think.

237
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.590
Okay.

238
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.420
Yeah.

239
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:19.850
Okay.

240
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.040
Yeah.

241
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.470
So we can get rid of this and use control and save.

242
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:28.970
Right.

243
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.320
Okay.

244
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.040
Okay.

245
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.970
I think we have the phones category.

246
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.330
Right.

247
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:35.660
Okay.

248
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.730
Let's go to the design for each category.

249
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.970
Category item.

250
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.520
Sorry.

251
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.310
Yeah.

252
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.540
We do have the funds.

253
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.390
But for some reasons we are not seeing the data via.

254
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.640
Okay.

255
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.490
Okay.

256
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.330
Click on this.

257
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.040
Okay.

258
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.430
You can see all the clothes, the split.

259
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.900
Wow, that's nice.

260
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.450
Okay, click on this.

261
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:23.860
Okay.

262
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.440
For some reasons, I think we don't have the fonts.

263
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.090
I think we do the click on laptop.

264
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:29.840
Okay.

265
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.280
We don't have the laptop yet.

266
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.480
So all we can just do to make sure this is walk in.

267
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.750
You can change this to.

268
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.690
Look here, we don't have any phones.

269
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.850
That's why it is not displayed.

270
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.270
Right?

271
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.990
We all need to have clothes we don't have any products on.

272
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.040
That's a category.

273
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.110
Right.

274
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.350
Okay.

275
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.330
So you can just had two dads.

276
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.640
You can just had products to that category.

277
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.130
Okay.

278
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.350
So I'm just going to come back to this again.

279
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:09.610
So what we are simply saying is over here, we have the design for of other category item.

280
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.630
We have the designs for each category.

281
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.090
Right.

282
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.610
And we are making this clickable by wrapping this with a gesture detector.

283
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.120
Right.

284
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:25.510
And in order to pass value, it is better navigation to be a type of push name.

285
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.290
Right.

286
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.710
So it takes the arguments.

287
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:37.000
And now what you are simply doing is we are passing the category name to the first category screen.

288
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.440
Right.

289
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.780
And raising the intensity.

290
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.040
Let's assess each category.

291
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:42.670
Right.

292
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.950
Then in the category, in the first category, we are simply using something known as sorry in the fields.

293
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.280
In the first category.

294
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:03.610
We are simply using something known as the model roots to accept that data we passed in the argument.

295
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.000
Right.

296
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:10.030
That is that in these categories, in this category, in the right way is in its assets those data.

297
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:17.500
Now, by accepting those data, we have it away and we store the data in the variable called category

298
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.770
name.
