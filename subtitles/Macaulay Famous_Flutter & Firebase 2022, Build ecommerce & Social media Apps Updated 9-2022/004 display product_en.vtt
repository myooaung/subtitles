00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.580
I woke up in the last lecture.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.890
We created this two products.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.689
Now, in this lecture.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
Your goal is not to display this products, not to do this.

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.970
We are going to go to the views directory of other than the screens.

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.610
Then over this widget folder or directory, we can then create a new high and be able to call this fi

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.570
products.

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.830
The reason for this is sort of calling it close is because we are just not only going to display close

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.030
related products, but regular displays displayed varieties of that.

10
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.330
Right?

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.560
So probably you can rename use this model class to products or we can just leave it like this for now.

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.950
Okay.

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.450
So it is going to be called products dots, the section of the sheet or dots.

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.390
And now we can use this to set list widgets.

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.780
Before then you're going to need to scroll through and be okay.

16
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.310
Now we can use less widgets and since we can change it later if the need arises.

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.480
Okay.

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.430
And we can call this products.

19
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.370
So your class expects the first data to be copied.

20
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940
You can just call this project I-10.

21
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.970
Okay.

22
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.120
They will see the reason for this.

23
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.900
Now, you can use control and dogs in order to enforce the material that that package if when there

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.680
is a new kind of key.

25
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.070
And so this you can just type without okay they're going to leave it in container since we want to have

26
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.270
access to part in property weeds and orders so I just going to read saw the container and then are which

27
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.760
side is going to be called widgets.

28
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.970
The reason for this is because once you have some rounded shape or rounded elevation around each product.

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.160
Okay.

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.650
Now, like I said, you're going to have to ship property.

31
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.490
The ship property.

32
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.370
Ship is going to be around that rectangle.

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.840
Rectangle border.

34
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.640
They were going to give me what I would use to.

35
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.500
This is what I would use.

36
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.400
That's all.

37
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.270
We're all just going to be whether we start school or.

38
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.170
Probably 15.

39
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.340
Or maybe we can change it later if it does monetize fictitious.

40
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.800
Now outside the rounded rectangle within the card.

41
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.760
We can then have a chart which is going to be a cola widget.

42
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.110
Right?

43
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.590
Because you can see.

44
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.860
The image and for that are being displayed vertically.

45
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.430
Right.

46
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.830
Okay.

47
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.930
So the child is going to be a collegiate.

48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.800
Ecologist.

49
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.400
Hello.

50
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.180
Okay.

51
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.420
The kidnapped children.

52
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.450
Now the first child is going to be a stock are the reason is you can see we have this new driver on

53
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.410
top of this image.

54
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.100
Right.

55
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.200
So you basically use stock to place widget.

56
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.980
And so it's widget.

57
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.000
So.

58
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.530
We're going to have a stock widget stock.

59
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.970
Which it then is stuck on.

60
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.810
What if we did?

61
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.590
That is you can place gloss over the image so you can have which address.

62
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.340
Right.

63
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.710
Okay.

64
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.320
To.

65
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.270
The first sight is going to be a container.

66
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.420
That is the image for the container.

67
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.080
For the image.

68
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000
Now you can give a weight in height to this first along.

69
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.070
We want the continent to be.

70
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.600
We want it to be able to last a long day.

71
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.980
We can give it weeks to this.

72
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.490
That's how wide it's going to be of.

73
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.030
Probably we can see 200, right?

74
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.770
I think 200 will do fine.

75
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.590
And then we can have a declaration of class.

76
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.110
This will be box decoration.

77
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.180
Right.

78
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.600
Okay.

79
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.770
Then we can give you a better idea as to the image that this will want the image to be.

80
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.310
So I have several that ship so we can say whatever videos, whatever videos.

81
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.140
What I would use the takeover of 15 as well.

82
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.530
Okay.

83
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.610
I did change color.

84
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.380
Okay, great.

85
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.060
Now it's in the first declaration.

86
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.260
Right.

87
00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.030
We can then have something known as image is going to be declaration.

88
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.380
Decoration.

89
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.430
Image.

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.160
There are varieties of these images, right?

91
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.930
So this are the way.

92
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.820
So we can have the image.

93
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.970
You can see the hero is gone because it was this image property as is required fields.

94
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.050
Okay.

95
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.680
Now, what we're going to do now is they're going to use the assets.

96
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.790
Assets.

97
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.430
Image.

98
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.220
Assess image.

99
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.410
Okay, great.

100
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.810
Now we're going to need to have access to.

101
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.920
This close.

102
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.940
Moderates.

103
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.400
Okay.

104
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.040
So to do that, so obsessed with it.

105
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.820
What you're going to need to do is.

106
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.590
Whether you are going to create a fine, agreeable court.

107
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.130
Close.

108
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.780
We're just going to specify the type.

109
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.030
It is a type of clause.

110
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.490
Okay.

111
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.460
There's a way that we can call this clause.

112
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.820
Okay.

113
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.060
Not in essence, to do this, to pass it on to the constructor.

114
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.320
So any time we call this product item in in another fly, we can simply also have access to that property.

115
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.500
So what you can do is use control and then you're going to go to create construct of a final fields

116
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.540
that we can make this required.

117
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.580
Required.

118
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.170
Okay, great.

119
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.480
So now over there we can then see close.

120
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.080
Close.

121
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.760
So it's.

122
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.440
Images.

123
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.320
Well, you can see we have access to the property there.

124
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.510
We can also call that it is string dots to string.

125
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.750
Okay, great.

126
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.540
So we can then add the critical to the coma is consciousness to see.

127
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.160
Okay.

128
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:23.670
Now this decoration as it's known, as I think I cited the assets in which it as a property known as

129
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.860
fields is going to be suites.

130
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.230
Well, I'm just gonna get rid of this for now.

131
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.690
So you see what it does yourself, so that we can use this to see not to see this in action.

132
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.570
You're going to need to use control and be to make this smaller.

133
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.600
Then we're going to go to the home screen.

134
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.020
Okay.

135
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.470
So for now, we can just use the close.

136
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.810
So we called it.

137
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.550
So that's.

138
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.760
Item.

139
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.640
Okay.

140
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.960
Like I see districts.

141
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.700
So.

142
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.200
Values rights.

143
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.110
So what you can't do that is going to be then.

144
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.520
We can for now.

145
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.570
We can use control again.

146
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:17.300
They're able to copy just one item for an hour of positive control and see to copy the control.

147
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.900
And B, then you can need to go back to this.

148
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.240
And over here, we can just face this.

149
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.080
Okay.

150
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.500
Then I can use control, and it's not important.

151
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.120
It's okay.

152
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.130
We can use controls to save.

153
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.830
Okay.

154
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.750
And.

155
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.660
Okay.

156
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.620
Okay.

157
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.190
Okay.

158
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.710
Okay.

159
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.100
Okay.

160
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.810
Now go check what he just did.

161
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.900
Okay.

162
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.800
You can sit over here.

163
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.220
Right.

164
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.470
Looking great.

165
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.870
Now, what we can do is.

166
00:07:59.230 --> 00:07:59.950
We can.

167
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:04.940
Well there.

168
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.050
Okay.

169
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.080
I think in the product item.

170
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.020
So that item.

171
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.030
Okay.

172
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.220
Okay.

173
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.510
We'll cut this further to that.

174
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:19.890
Okay.

175
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.770
Now, we can also you can see in the finished product, we have all our tests at the middle.

176
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.040
Right.

177
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.280
So what you can do is over this column widget.

178
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.520
The core of the can say cross artists elements.

179
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.000
Cross artists elements.

180
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.400
Cross asks amendments to censor.

181
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.780
Okay.

182
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.440
Now.

183
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.780
There's nothing to hide.

184
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.500
Okay.

185
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.520
Now, Iraq is not going to have any effect, actually.

186
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.880
So what you can do now is a.

187
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.060
We can then have the fields.

188
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.890
So within the Declaration, you can see fields is going to be fields.

189
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.080
Fits with.

190
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.230
Most fields.

191
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:21.350
So it was fields that fits with the way you're going to use the office, which is that that height.

192
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.550
Okay.

193
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.590
In a good deal of time to see what it does.

194
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.100
Okay.

195
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.110
Really no effect.

196
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.130
You can also use the cover.

197
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.180
Okay.

198
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.090
Let's go see what it does.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.530
Okay.

You know what you fed?

203
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.100
What about the container?

204
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.800
Okay.

205
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.040
Okay, then watch your head as well.

206
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.610
Okay, guys, I'm just going to stop here.
