00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.380
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.390
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.810
In this lecture, we are going to limit the card's quantity.

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.130
And the reason for this is because you can see currently users are able to reduce their cards item to

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.720
less than one.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.290
Now I think this is a very bad design.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.300
So what we can do is immediately it is below one.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.430
We want to disable this minus button to do this.

9
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.150
Alright.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.080
Yeah right after the press we can say cuts provider.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.640
Card provider.

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.650
Don't get items right.

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.200
And we want to assess each item based on just the quantity.

14
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.170
And we can then say if it is equal to one, then we want to disable it by saying no else if it is not

15
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.780
equal to one, we.

16
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.720
Everybody wants to be able to do.

17
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.370
Right.

18
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.150
Okay.

19
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.410
Great.

20
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.600
And let's go try this out.

21
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.530
Okay.

22
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm just going to go do it again.

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.350
And you can see currently it is disabled because it is equal to one and.

24
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.280
Okay.

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.230
We can no longer document.

26
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.980
Now, what we are also going to do is you can see currently for this product, which is going to show

27
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.940
you this quickly.

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.190
For this products, you can see we have just four pieces that is for heights and available.

29
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.470
That is for a high force available.

30
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.460
So what we want to do is we do not want users to be able to hold more more products than what we have.

31
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.960
Okay.

32
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.590
To do this over here.

33
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.900
We are also going to disable the button.

34
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.030
We are going to say card provider.

35
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.180
To get items and we want to assess them by their index and quantity.

36
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.190
Is equal to.

37
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.650
Kat's provider.

38
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.220
Card provider that was get items and we want to assess them they are intense then those talk.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.780
In stock.

40
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.400
Sorry about the stock is basically referring to how many products we have.

41
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.660
If it is equal to what we have in database, we then want to say no else.

42
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.620
We want to be able to increment.

43
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.250
This is basically it.

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.010
Use control and save and go check this out.

45
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.860
Okay.

46
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.320
You can see currently we have four iPhones available.

47
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.860
Right.

48
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.220
So let's go check.

49
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.200
And currently we have heard that we have heard that maybe three or we are incrementing our cards quantity

50
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.170
to say we need three of this product and let's go to four.

51
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.120
And you can see currently it is disabled because we have just four available.

52
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.580
Okay.

53
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.930
Working as expected.

54
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.840
Okay.

55
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.430
I'm just going to implement this again.

56
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.880
Goo goo goo goo.

57
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.480
Goo goo.

58
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.490
Okay.

59
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.700
And now we can segment Cisco.

60
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.400
Okay.

61
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.900
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
