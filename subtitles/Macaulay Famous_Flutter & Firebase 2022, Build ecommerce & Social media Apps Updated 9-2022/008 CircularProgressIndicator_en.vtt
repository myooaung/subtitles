00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.570
Hey.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.560
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.560
Now, after all these fields are filled in and immediately the user clicks on, sign up, what are we

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.500
going to do is we're going to show a circle of progress indicator to tell the user that, hey, your

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.330
account has been created and you have to wait till it finishes.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.910
Okay, then in order to do this, we are going to need to go back to our VC code and then the landing

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.070
customer screen and now we can use controller and B to make the switch.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.910
Now the first step is we're going to create a variable which is going to be a type of boo.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.560
And the reason is because the variable is going to be the true or false value.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.890
So in order to do that over here, we can just go ahead and specify this variable is going to be a type

11
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.810
of boo and we can call this variable is loading and defaults.

12
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.960
We're going to set it to false.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.430
You're going to see why shortly.

14
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.970
Okay.

15
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.520
And what we can also do is we can make our code a bit more cleaner.

16
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.140
So over here.

17
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.360
Where we have this, you can alight and use control and see to copy.

18
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.760
And now we can get rid of it.

19
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.230
And.

20
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.710
Over here, we can then create a function which we are going to call sign up.

21
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.300
And we can then place this.

22
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.740
And what we can as well do.

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.910
We can wait for it by using the async via.

24
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.010
And I wait.

25
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.780
Great.

26
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.910
And now we can then create the load spinner.

27
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.810
Immediately the user clicks on the sign up.

28
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.200
We are going to test it because we basically want to update the UI to something else.

29
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.080
So over here we can test that states.

30
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.340
Said states.

31
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.010
And we're going to set a slowdown.

32
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.700
That is its variable, its load is going to be equal to two.

33
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.560
So we want to start loading.

34
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.210
Okay.

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.230
And after the account has been created or if there is any error, we are also going to set states because

36
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.510
we are going to stop the load spinner.

37
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.000
So over here we can say set state.

38
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.560
And we're going to set a slowdown.

39
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.130
Back to forest.

40
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.620
That is, we want to stop loading.

41
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.210
For us.

42
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.540
Okay, great.

43
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.430
And now we can do some check.

44
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.670
Over this test.

45
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.650
We jets where we have the sign up.

46
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.090
Okay, this is it.

47
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.340
But before then, we can just call this function.

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.880
So over here we can call the sign up function.

49
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.110
Sign up, and now we can have some check.

50
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.970
So over here, this test.

51
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.750
It's going to scroll down a bit and over here we can say if it's loaded, that is slow loading.

52
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.590
It's equal to true.

53
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.610
Then we want to display something known as circular.

54
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.470
Secular.

55
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.860
Progress.

56
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.950
Indicates a cycle of progress.

57
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.790
And the kids are.

58
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.000
So I just think we have to call this.

59
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.620
If it is law, then we want to display a circular progress indicator.

60
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.880
Else if it is not loading, then we want to display the test.

61
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.230
Okay, great.

62
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.620
Now, this is basically it is control and let's say.

63
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.360
So over here.

64
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.200
We created a rainbow card.

65
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.900
It's slow then, and it is a type of bull because it is a type of true or false value.

66
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.390
And that's what make our code more cleaner.

67
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.150
We created a function and we basically just pasted this and over a minute the user clicks on sign up.

68
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:17.600
We want to start loading and after the account has been created, or if there is no error or if there

69
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.779
is an error, we want to basically stop the load spinner.

70
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.780
You're going to see this in practice.

71
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.430
Okay.

72
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.550
So first of all, we just have to go to our experts and now we can click on Sign Up.

73
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.120
If you can see, please fill must not be empty.

74
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.080
And that is because these fields are not yet filled.

75
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.830
Okay, so we can just create an account.

76
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.420
My colleague.

77
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.950
Going to use McCauley and G.M..

78
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.380
That's calm.

79
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.420
Sorry.

80
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.200
This should be the full name.

81
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.030
So for the full name, I'm just going to use my colleague famous.

82
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.990
And we're just going to use my colleague.

83
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.240
So for that.

84
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.950
My colleague at.

85
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.180
Right.

86
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.620
So we had.

87
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.120
It's become a bit crazy.

88
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.980
That's calm.

89
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.640
And the password is B, Y and ESI.

90
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.560
Now click on signup like you can see the loading spinner and after the account has been created, it's

91
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.340
going to start.

92
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.930
You can see the accounts of this currently going on.

93
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.080
The account has been created and it has stopped loading OC.

94
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.300
You can see why I think we printed the email in the last lecture.

95
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.890
So this is the email.

96
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.080
Seems good, right?

97
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.500
Okay.

98
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.250
So you can see we're basically printing the email.

99
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.280
After the accounts.

100
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.890
You can see over here, we said once the account has been created, we basically want to print the email

101
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.140
to the consumer.

102
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.930
And that is why you send it via.

103
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.890
So you can see the value and accounts created.

104
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.040
Okay, great.

105
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.440
So what we can do is.

106
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.280
We can.

107
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.660
Have some style.

108
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.810
Okay.

109
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.380
We tend to circle our progress indicator.

110
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.810
There we have this progress indicator.

111
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.980
I'm just going to look for it.

112
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.260
Okay.

113
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.520
This is the way we can see color that is going to change that little spinner.

114
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.490
You can see color that's going to be colors that.

115
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.010
Whites.

116
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.090
Okay.

117
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.570
And this conference is safe.

118
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.390
And upon your seminar.

119
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.260
They're going to have an error because the account is already existing.

120
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.090
But we're just going to track click on sign up.

121
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.830
You can see clearly something's going on and there is an error because.

122
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.890
That account as we created in our database.

123
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.540
But you can see currently is white.

124
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.050
Okay, so let's change the email to something else.

125
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.390
So I can see my colleague Mark.

126
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.360
And click on Sign Up.

127
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.170
Currently no account has been created.

128
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.640
Okay.

129
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.750
So you can see accounts created.

130
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.280
My colleague Mark Sims.

131
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.350
Good luck, guys.

132
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.980
See you.

133
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.760
And then this lecture.
