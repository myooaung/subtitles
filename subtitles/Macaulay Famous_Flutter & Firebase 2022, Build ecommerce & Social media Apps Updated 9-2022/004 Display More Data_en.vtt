00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.710
In this lecture, we are going to continue building the product detail screen.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.790
Now over here, we are going to have the name of the products to do this.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.680
You can see basically we have this size box and it's basically for this image we have over here.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.430
Right?

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.960
So we have to come out from this size box and over here we can just have the transformer and it will

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.830
come here and use control and has to save first.

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.320
Okay.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.560
And outside the size box, we can then have a test.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.070
And the value is going to be the product least viable.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.670
And we basically want to assess the product name, how they're trying to compare and use concur and

13
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.720
has to save.

14
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.670
And you're going to see the name of the product over a year.

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.100
Okay Cisco and we can style this a bit.

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:11.690
Store and test STI and we can increase the font size to maybe 19.

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770
And also, we can increase the font suite.

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.510
Font suite.

19
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.900
The Board and its control needs to save.

20
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.140
And go check it out.

21
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.620
Okay.

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.440
Cool.

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.380
And also, we can sell it as person.

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.270
And we're going to set this for.

25
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.290
Use control and save.

26
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.990
Go check it out.

27
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.770
Okay.

28
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.230
Okay.

29
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.280
And we could also give this a caller.

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.460
CALLER.

31
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.270
Sorry.

32
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.160
CALLER.

33
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:59.500
CALLER and we can say, call us Grey and we can give this a shade of maybe 600.

34
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.900
Okay, Cisco.

35
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.770
Okay.

36
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.220
Cisco and Nest, what we are going to be doing next is we're going to have a test over year which is

37
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.200
going to say USD and over year we're going to have the price of the products and over year we are going

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.500
to have the favorite icon.

39
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.900
Now, with what I just explained, you can see we are going to be using a raw widget for this.

40
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.500
Okay?

41
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.810
So over here we can just have a comma and we're going to be using the raw widgets.

42
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.560
A row with that.

43
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.920
And as you know, the rule can take multiple widgets.

44
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:50.380
So it has this children property and the first child of the row is going to be a test and it's just

45
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.040
going to say sorry, you as the.

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.570
Okay.

47
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.760
And also we can style this a bit.

48
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.570
Test STI.

49
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.890
The star and.

50
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.620
Maybe font size of 18 as well.

51
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.400
And.

52
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.010
Okay.

53
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.300
Is control necessary?

54
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.650
Okay.

55
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.030
You can see the wire.

56
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.200
And maybe we could also give this a caller ID because.

57
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.700
The sign.

58
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.440
Okay.

59
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.640
Okay.

60
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.780
You're going to sit over here?

61
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.610
Okay.

62
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.930
And now we can just copy this.

63
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.010
You to come over here and paste.

64
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.600
Okay.

65
00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.170
And this is of this we have to get rid of this and call the product list.

66
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.270
Call the product list.

67
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.330
And we basically want to assess the price.

68
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.830
And this is not a string, but it is a double.

69
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.120
So we have to convert it to a string now and use control and save.

70
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.370
Okay.

71
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.649
You're going to sit over here.

72
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.640
Okay.

73
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.540
You can see.

74
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.200
Okay.

75
00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.610
And.

76
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.300
Lastly, we can add the newcomer and then have an icon button.

77
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.550
Okay.

78
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.960
This is going to take the press and.

79
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.560
This is going to be an icon.

80
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.990
Icon Widget and icons.

81
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.060
Dot words.

82
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.870
Dot Favorites.

83
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.460
Save or.

84
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.360
Hopefully I can spell right on the score line.

85
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.290
Outline.

86
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.860
Okay.

87
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.920
I think it's outlined.

88
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.080
Border.

89
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.480
Border.

90
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.540
Okay.

91
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.390
This fits right on the scoreboard, on the score line.

92
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.150
And over in this, to see what you are missing, I think we are missing one additional parenthesis.

93
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:22.760
And also we can give a color to this icon color start red and we can increase the size of the icon to

94
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.590
maybe 30 and use to save now and go check this out.

95
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.220
Okay, Cisco.

96
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.980
And now what we can do is.

97
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.130
Within the row.

98
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.730
We can then say main axis alignment, main axis elements, the space between.

99
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.390
Okay.

100
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.040
Right.

101
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.130
So it's not take this to this and.

102
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.580
Okay.

103
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.270
Now what we can do, you can see there's a big gap between this and this.

104
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.870
So what we can just do is we can wrap this test, which adds with another row and.

105
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.990
We are going to call this from year.

106
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.160
Courts did it and placed it within the rule.

107
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.390
These containers are saved and it's going to be very close to this now.

108
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.440
And hopefully you understand.

109
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.110
Okay.

110
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.900
And now what we can just do?

111
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.950
We can give a size box within this.

112
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.910
So as boss and we are given the space horizontally, right?

113
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:40.730
So it's going to be width of maybe just five and it to cover these containers to save and go check it

114
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.240
out.

115
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.060
Okay.

116
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.170
Okay.

117
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.970
And now we can wrap this entire row with a pardon.

118
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.900
Of maybe just ten.

119
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.500
Okay.

120
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.760
Okay.

121
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.240
And now we have to come out from the right.

122
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.760
You come and within the call of rights, we basically just use the column to wrap everything up because

123
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.690
all our widgets are generally going to be displayed vertically.

124
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.530
Right.

125
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.560
But within the vertical space, we could also display other widgets horizontally.

126
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.560
But basically everything are being displayed vertically.

127
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.840
So what we can just do, we can have another test.

128
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.900
Of another test.

129
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.840
And this is going to say maybe.

130
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.530
I think we have a variable or.

131
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.140
Sorry.

132
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.700
I'm just going to check this for something like in stock or something like that.

133
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.780
Okay.

134
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.890
We have this.

135
00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.940
Is talk.

136
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.540
Sorry.

137
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.470
Okay.

138
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.590
In stock.

139
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.390
Okay.

140
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.070
That is the quantity, right?

141
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.670
Okay.

142
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.980
So back to the detail.

143
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.310
We can just use this.

144
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.230
Okay.

145
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.920
Use this and all the dollar sign because we basically want to have a test available, so we have to

146
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.120
concatenate it.

147
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.250
So this is going to be products.

148
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.409
Product list.

149
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.260
And we want to assess the.

150
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.780
In.

151
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.120
In stock.

152
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.960
Okay.

153
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.470
He is concerned to save.

154
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.240
And I think we should be seen as zero.

155
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:58.210
I think one we have one item stock and over here we can then say one item is.

156
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.470
Okay.

157
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.080
We can just pieces.

158
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.720
P.

159
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:11.480
I feel I can spare that these pieces.

160
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.420
A volleyball.

161
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.810
Volleyball.

162
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.250
Volleyball.

163
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.760
In stock.

164
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.660
Okay, Cisco.

165
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.770
And now we can give this a little color.

166
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.560
So let's just try and.

167
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.970
So it has to.

168
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:43.080
This time, we can maybe close close those grades and make it fade.

169
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.010
So agree.

170
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.760
And I think this should be okay for now.

171
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.240
Okay.

172
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.900
Sims Cool.

173
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.710
Okay, guys.
