Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.870
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.450
In this section, we're going to be able to pick image from either gallery or camera.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.070
Okay.

5
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.120
Now, in order to do this, we are going to be using the package.

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.650
So you're going to need to head up to your browser and then head up to pop the depth.

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.320
And over here, we are going to search for a package known as image picker.

8
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.230
Okay.

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.770
And then we have to click on this first link or via.

10
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.360
But before then you can basically see what it does flow to plug in for selecting images from the Android

11
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.580
and OS image library and taking your pictures with camera.

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.410
So we're going to need to click on this first link over here and we need to copy this code and then

13
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.670
head back to our VTS code and then.

14
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.140
The pulse beck dot yaml file.

15
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.850
And.

16
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.500
We are going to need to pace this right over here.

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.900
Now, use control, and that's to save this file.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.850
Okay.

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.180
This is going to get the package.

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.570
And after it finishes, you're going to need to stop your half of it and rerun.

21
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.300
Okay.

22
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.440
Okay, guys.

23
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.850
See you in the next.

24
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.120
Let's.
