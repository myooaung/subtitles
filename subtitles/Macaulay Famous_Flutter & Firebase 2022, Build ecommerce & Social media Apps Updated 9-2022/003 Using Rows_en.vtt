00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.380
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.030
In this lecture, we're going to have to recess with that over here.

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.460
But I think in the previous lecture I said, we're going to have two icons, button, but we can just

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.440
go with the test widget.

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.010
Okay.

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.980
Now this three test widgets are going to be displayed horizontally.

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.740
That is from left to right.

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.370
Okay.

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.470
Now within the container.

11
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.380
We are going to have.

12
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.140
A child and the child is going to be a role which at.

13
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.560
And as they know, the rule can take in multiple widgets.

14
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.140
Okay.

15
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.510
Now, the first child is going to be a test widget and this is going to say cuts.

16
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.890
You can try to save and you're going to sit over here.

17
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.450
Okay.

18
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.600
Great.

19
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.040
And we can increase the font size of this test.

20
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.220
It says tie.

21
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.720
And we can then say font size to be 20.

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.350
Five.

23
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.300
Okay.

24
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.970
Now we're going to make this test clickable.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.800
In order to do that, we have to wrap this with a button now via a light use controller dots wrap widget.

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.560
We can wrap this with a gesture detector.

27
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.600
We can wrap this with an equal or an elevated button.

28
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.010
But we're just going to wrap this with a test button.

29
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.920
It has button and we need to have this compress, which is a function, and for now we can leave it

30
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.490
empty.

31
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.990
Okay.

32
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.150
Now, what we have to do is to copy this.

33
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.150
It's LCA.

34
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.660
Okay.

35
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.000
I'll come over here and paste this.

36
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.590
This is going to be for the order test.

37
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.950
And how did she come over here via and paste?

38
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.360
And this is going to say which list?

39
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.030
Okay.

40
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.140
Now.

41
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.210
You can see.

42
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.100
Okay.

43
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.729
Now, what are we going to do?

44
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.470
Is.

45
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.170
We are.

46
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.960
Over a year.

47
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.030
We can then say main US elements made us this alignment.

48
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.420
This is going to be main as this element space around to have a core space.

49
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.420
Okay.

50
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.990
Okay.

51
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.440
Great.

52
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.070
And now we can change the color of this.

53
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.450
We can then say, caller, this is going to be callers that may be seen.

54
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.580
Okay.

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.100
Close the scene.

56
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.820
Okay.

57
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.250
I think it's already on CNN.

58
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.950
Or probably we can just change this to black.

59
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.470
Like colours black.

60
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.860
Or you can just go with any colour you desire.

61
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.810
The colours of black.

62
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.010
And.

63
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.480
Colors.

64
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.510
Colors the black.

65
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.940
And.

66
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.900
Call us.

67
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.270
The black hopefully is going to look well.

68
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.280
If not, we're still going to change this.

69
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.340
Okay.

70
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.380
Had the trachoma.

71
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.690
Fully.

72
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.380
Probably we can't just go without saying I think that is okay, but you can just have your own style.

73
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.560
Okay.

74
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.420
And.

75
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.930
Control an effort to save.

76
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.380
Okay.

77
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.530
We have to get rid of this as well.

78
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.120
Okay.

79
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.740
And that's it over there.

80
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.840
And we can then say font.

81
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.800
Weeds finds weeds.

82
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.760
The board.

83
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.060
We can just copy this.

84
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.580
And so is this.

85
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.750
And.

86
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.519
And Piers, this is control that's to save.

87
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.490
And hopefully now you understand how hero works.

88
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.240
Right.

89
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.870
Okay.

90
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.430
We can just reduce this to 22 or 23.

91
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.300
23.

92
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.740
And.

93
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.440
22 is okay.

94
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.150
Okay.

95
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.670
Hopefully now you understand how the world works.

96
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.320
And in the last lecture, we are finally going to finish this.

97
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.580
Okay.

98
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.540
Okay, guys.

99
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.640
See you in the next lecture.
