You can see your package.

37
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.380
There is generally the application idea in your half level.

38
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.070
Okay, so this is the half level, right?

39
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.720
So this should be it.

40
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.230
Okay.

41
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.070

Okay.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.930
Now we don't really need to since we are not doing any google signing you can see is basically for Google

51
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.220
signing or signing in with Google.

52
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.210

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.930
Then click on Nest.

74
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.360

75
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.500
Now, first of all, he's asking us to heart this line.

76
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.910
This is asking us to heart the line.

77
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.030
You can see the project level.

78
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.780
We could use this.

79
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.750
We're going to copy this.

80
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.620
This is the project level, right?

81
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.620
So should be this.

82
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.500
Okay.

83
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.690
Think is asking us to paste it over a.

84
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.240
Great control.

85
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.110
NASA save.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.400
Okay.

87
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.520
Now we're going to go down.

88
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.810
Okay.

89
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.630
I think this is all about.

90
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.900
That's okay.

91
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.900
Now you're going to copy this over the Apply plugin that I think is asking us to fix it to the upper

92
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.020
level view the cradle.

93
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.360
So this is the app level, right?

94
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.980
So this a view that gradle.

95
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.380
So this is going to face this.

96
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.170
Over a year.

97
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.860
Case continues to.

98
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.780
Okay.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.860
Now, I'm going to copy this over here as well.

100
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.580
Great.

101
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.790
So I think it's the same for this.

102
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.510
So it's going to be to make this wide.

103
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.960
Okay.

104
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.150

Okay.

109
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.630
Now what you can do, we can change this minimal SDK version to 21.

110
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.150
I'm trying this to save.

111
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.150
Okay.

112
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.990

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.130
Okay.

122
00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.850
