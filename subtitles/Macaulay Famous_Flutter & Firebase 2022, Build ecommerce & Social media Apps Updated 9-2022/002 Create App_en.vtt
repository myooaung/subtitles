Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.230
Now, this lecture, we're going to create a Flutter project, and I'm going to create this Flutter

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.670
project on my desktop.

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.410
So to do this, I want to say seedy tech stuff, okay?

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.210
Not to create a flutter project.

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.810
All you have to do is to say Flutter Create Now was the name of the project when I called my e-commerce

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.950
on this call.

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.170
After you can call, use any name you desire, then I'm going to click on Enter.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.210
Okay.

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.650
Now you can see this creating a project.

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.090
This is going to take some time.

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.960
The little stuff just then you can wait till it finishes.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.630
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
