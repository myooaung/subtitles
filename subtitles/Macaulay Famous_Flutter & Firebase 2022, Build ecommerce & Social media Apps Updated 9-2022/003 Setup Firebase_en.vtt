00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:01.920
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.520
In this lecture, we're going to set up Firebase, so we're going to need to click on this build, and

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.650
I'm going to click on authentication.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.940
Okay?

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
Then we will navigate to this sign in method.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.200
Okay.

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.550
So I majored.

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.760
Okay.

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.090
First of all, I think we have to click on Get Started.

11
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.220
Okay.

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.970
And users are going to be able to assign all points, email and password.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.220
So we have to enable this.

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.190
So click on Enable and click on Save as well.

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.100
Click on Build.

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
And I'm going to open this Firebase First or database and a new tab.

17
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.220
And as well the storage in the new tab.

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.870
Okay.

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.110
We just have to wait for this.

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.670
Okay.

21
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.260
Still loaded.

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.020
OC oc oc.

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.490
I think it's darn.

24
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.220
You just have to try this.

25
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.020
And over here.

26
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.250
We need to click on Get Started as well.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.330
And that we have the stats in production mode and stats in text mode.

28
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.390
So I'm going to go for the stats and test mode.

29
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.840
And since we can change it later, I can click on Nest.

30
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.700
And I'm just going to go with the difference, Don.

31
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.300
Okay.

32
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.650
Now we can.

33
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.980
As we all click on Create Database.

34
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.960
Remember I said we are going to be saving all our details in the cloud faster.

35
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.660
And that was one of the reasons why we installed the cloud faster package.

36
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.720
So now we are going to need to click on create database and start in test mode.

37
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.220
Okay.

38
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.570
We can just go with enable.

39
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.670
That is the default key.

40
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.600
Check this.

41
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.800
Okay.

42
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.670
Okay.

43
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.000
So with this storage, we're going to be able to upload images.

44
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.240
That is the product images, the user's profile images.

45
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.250
But in order to do that, we're going to need to navigate to these rules.

46
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.580
Okay.

47
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.150
All right, look, let's go to this city created.

48
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.140
I think I have some network issues starting to explode.

49
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.470
I think it's done.

50
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.020
Pakistan already.

51
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.150
Okay.

52
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.320
Now for the storage, you can see over here it says hello, read and write.

53
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.000
So what we can do from this part.

54
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.340
We can get rid of this.

55
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.490
And get rid of this and then have the train come back.

56
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.050
So for that, what this means is we want to be able to read and write data unlike before, like the

57
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.260
default one, which we won't be able to read and write data.

58
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.900
So this was the default.

59
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.620
With this, we won't be able to read and write data.

60
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.180
So what we have to do is to get rid of this because we want to be able to upload data and also retrieve

61
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.770
data.

62
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.350
So allow, read and write.

63
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.210
So via we can add a semicolon and click on publish.

64
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.380
So now we're going to be able to upload images and as well being able to retrieve images.

65
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.440
So now over here, this is the cloud file store.

66
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.800
We are going to be saving all our data over this cloud faster, such as the images as well.

67
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.830
That is the image here and the address of the user.

68
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.180
The full name.

69
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.700
Address of the full name of the user, the phone number of the user, the address of the user and so

70
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.120
on.

71
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.240
And in order to do that, we also need to be able to post and retrieve data.

72
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.990
So we need to go to this rules.

73
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.220
Okay, Rose as well.

74
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.280
We need to get rid of this in order for each to allow us be able to post and retrieve data.

75
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.400
So now we can read our rights.

76
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.160
So get rid of this and have a semicolon.

77
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.280
Click on publish.

78
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.470
Okay.

79
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.690
This is basically AIDS.

80
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.200
So now we can store our data in the cloud faster.

81
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.620
We can store our images, the profile images, the product images in our storage.

82
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.420
And over here, we had also enabled.

83
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.190
Users to be able to sign up with email and password.

84
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.960
So the next lecture we are going to start building the functionality in order to sign up users.

85
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.130
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
