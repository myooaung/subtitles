16
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.150
Kids just.

17
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.130

18
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.250
Around.

19
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.000
The bush.

20
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.120
The bush.

21
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.530
Okay.

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.480
Okay.

23
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.190

Now make sure you just click this was and go check it.

26
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.820
Tell me you didn't see some stuff going on there.

27
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.140
Okay.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.950
Output.

29
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.310
And you can see it is currently pulled in and said it nearly finished uploading.

30
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.450
We want to go back to the previous screen, you can see.

31
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.170
That's what we did over a year.

32
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.310
Okay.

33
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.860
Okay.

34
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.730
You can see that's what we did over here.

35
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.310
We said when they finish uploading, we want Dan to go back to.

36
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.420
That to us is going to take some time and.

37
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.900
Okay.

38
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.390
Okay.

39
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.960
It's going to take some time depending on the video.

40
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.510
Okay.

41
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.170
Okay.

42
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.850
Okay.

43
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.490
Okay.

44
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.970
Okay.

45
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.360
Okay.

46
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.750
Okay.

47
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.230
Okay.

48
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.180
Okay.

49
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.950
We are going to go because I think he's going to take us to the to the previous screen.

50
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.220
Right.

51
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.600
Okay.

52
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.950
This is taking longer than expected based on network.

53
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.430
Okay.

54
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.100
Now, I already have done that before.

55
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.260
And you can see it over here.

56
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.730
You can see the uses we have and you can see the video and we've always said we want the video.

57
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.770
The idea of the video is the key.

58
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.810
We want the idea of the video to be how many video we have so far.

59
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.590
Right.

60
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.970
And that is why you see.

61
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.100
Zero value.

62
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.090
Right.

63
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.860
This is okay.

64
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.630
You can see it.

65
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.980
You can see we said videos in length and over here.

66
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.130
We are over here.

67
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.130
We are simply getting the length of the video that you can see.

68
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.410
Right.

69
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.860
Okay.

70
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.810
Okay.

71
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.480
And.

72
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.050
Okay.

73
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.760
Just to go to go to this and see if it's done.

74
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.180
Okay.

75
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.690
Okay.

76
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.950
Okay.

77
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.460
Okay.

78
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.290
Videos.

79
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.100
Okay.

80
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.270
You can see is done.

81
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.230
Okay.

82
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.050
Now let's check.

83
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.740
You can see, too, because back to the previous screen.

84
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.980
And this video weren't in this video, too.

85
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.830
So it is video one, right.

86
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.550
Or zero.

87
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.480
And this one.

88
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.960
Okay.

89
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.930
You can see the capture keys just playing around the bush and it has zero comment counts and zero likes.

90
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.120
You can see it is released.

91
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.780
Right.

92
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.200
Okay.

93
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.850
And this is the profile which you attached to the Google account.

94
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.090
Okay.

95
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170
And the share count is as well, zero.

96
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.300
And the song name is this song.

97
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.250
You can see the top there.

98
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.830
You can try to.

99
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.230
In concrete in a twilight zone of concurrency and openness.

100
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.940
Okay.

101
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.820
As well.

102
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.350
You can see we have.

103
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.920
The Stone Age activities were checked out quickly.

104
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.250
Okay.

105
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.390
That's what he told me.

106
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.430
You can see it automatically generated the image from the video.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.890
Images generated from the video.

111
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.240
There's going to be seen because I'll put this in the video.
