00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.710
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.710
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.750
In this lecture, we are going to change the name of our collection.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.190
And the reason for this is because we are basically going to have the type of users that is the customers

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.230
and the seller.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
So what we can do, we can have two type of collections over here.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.140
One is going to be for just the customers and the other is going to be for just the sellers.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.250
Okay, so what we can do, we can just delete this collection.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.600
And use this.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.590
Yet.

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.080
Now we can delete and we have to do some change on our code back to voice code.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.470
And the first change we have to do is to.

13
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.160
Okay.

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.640
The controller within the controllers territory.

15
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.160
And this is not going to be uses, but the name of the collection is going to be called customers.

16
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.210
Customers.

17
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.920
Okay, great.

18
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.860
And we also have to make this change.

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.880
And before then we can just use control and save.

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.920
And we have to make this change in the profile screen.

21
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.350
The profile screen where we are fetching our data.

22
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.710
And over.

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.720
Yes.

24
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.310
So this is going to be Easton's data collection.

25
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.540
And we basically want to fetch from where the customer's collection is necessary.

26
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.850
And you can see why just been successfully deleted.

27
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.970
And we definitely need to create an account.

28
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.410
But before we create another account, we are going to have some extra fields over.

29
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.100
Okay.

30
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.020
The controller.

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.240
What's controller over?

32
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.720
Yeah.

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.300
We also had the address of the user, but for now we are going to make it empty.

34
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.870
Okay.

35
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.830
Address.

36
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.160
Because we definitely need the address of the user to tell where the product is going to be shipped

37
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.690
to.

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.920
And for now we can leave it empty and have your newcomer and the other feed we are going to have is

39
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.960
the UID of the user.

40
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.870
So via we can just make this the first item and we can call this customer ID.

41
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.150
Or you can just use c ID.

42
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.760
That is customer ID and for the customer ID is going to be the idea of the user and remember why we

43
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.080
created the variable.

44
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.400
Called Creed and it also has access to the UID.

45
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.250
So what we can just do, we can then say create.

46
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.380
Creed.

47
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.620
That's.

48
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.050
User.

49
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.160
What?

50
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.120
Uid and over here we need a not check.

51
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.150
And over here we need a comma.

52
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.920
Okay, great.

53
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.950
So basically we have one, two, three, four, five, five fields later in the future, we're going

54
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.820
to be able to have address to this over here.

55
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.450
But for the now it is currently empty.

56
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.000
In the future, users will be able to update the address.

57
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.470
Okay.

58
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.290
And we can then try this out.

59
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.770
Okay.

60
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.460
I'm going to sign up.

61
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.780
And I'm going to pick a photo.

62
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.620
And I'm going to pick this beautiful lady over there.

63
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.900
And this is a girl I'm going to call her Joy.

64
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:59.590
Joy McCauley Hopefully she get married to me and for the email I'm just going to use joy email.

65
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.830
It's calm and for the password is a YMC.

66
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.920
I'm just going to be sure it is correct.

67
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.180
Okay.

68
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.970
And now we have to click on Sign Up.

69
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.240
Okay.

70
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.220
It's already in use.

71
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.829
I think I already have that.

72
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.079
Remember, we also do have some emails over here.

73
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.710
Right.

74
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.960
So that is where the hero is coming from.

75
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.380
That is the authentication tab.

76
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.280
Basically, when you create an account is is going to get saved here or is going to get stored here.

77
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.320
What we are basically doing after storing the data here, we basically needed to store it on our cloud

78
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.940
store database.

79
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.220
So we also need to delete it where you can see it.

80
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.660
So I'm going to delete it.

81
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.830
Delete accounts.

82
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.190
And hopefully we can then create a new one.

83
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.090
Okay.

84
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.360
Sign up.

85
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.070
And.

86
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.350
This.

87
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.680
Who's going to say Joy?

88
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.750
Famous.

89
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.360
And the past.

90
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.300
The image is going to be joy.

91
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.390
Jimmy.

92
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.240
Com calm and the password is b.j. see?

93
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.270
Sign up.

94
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.250
Hopefully not harass.

95
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.830
He was going to check if the password is correct.

96
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.030
It is correct.

97
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.200
And we have to wait for this debate and back to the fat store database.

98
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.780
Okay.

99
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.400
It has been successfully created.

100
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.700
You can see now we have this collection called customers and I think we have to use this.

101
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.920
Is that coming from?

102
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.610
Okay.

103
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.500
Joy.

104
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.770
Archie Miller, this column is going to delete one.

105
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.620
I think it was a mistake.

106
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.250
Some of the lead is the lead.

107
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.070
The leaked documents.

108
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.020
Okay.

109
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.760
And now we have justice.

110
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.210
Okay.

111
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.690
And let's see if we can log into the accounts to make sure all is working correctly.

112
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.560
Joy at Gmail dot com.

113
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.610
Jimmy did come.

114
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.410
And the MSC makes sure it is correct and log in.

115
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.350
Okay.

116
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.990
So it was good.

117
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.000
And let's go to the profile to see.

118
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.640
Just walk in.

119
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.980
Correct.

120
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.780
Joy famous and the email address you can see and later you can see we have this address.

121
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.140
In the future, users will be able to update the address.

122
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.840
And currently we made it empty.

123
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.430
Okay.

124
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.080
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
