00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.950
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.819
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.890
In this lecture, we're going to get you uploaded video thumbnail.

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.310
Okay.

5
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
Now to do this, rather than need to create a function and we're going to create this function before

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.360
this upload video.

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.420
So over here we can see, underscore and call.

8
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.000
This video gets some.

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.000
Nil.

10
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.720
Okay.

11
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.460
Now you're going to be using the weights and that is the weights.

12
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.410
We need to have the risk of that.

13
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.320
And as well, what we can do is we can pass the video parts, that is the parts to the pick the video

14
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.320
and all that we can specify.

15
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.970
It is a type of string and now we can create a final variable to store the results and we can call the

16
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.790
zero bottom.

17
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.680
Now that is going to be equal to that video compressed package.

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.280
We just start right with the compress and now we can have access to get five thumbnail.

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.650
And now I don't need to pass the video.

20
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.060
Parts that is part to depict video.

21
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.760
Right.

22
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.140
Okay.

23
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.720
So by doing this, we have access to some of the video.

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.740
So now all we need to do is to upload this.

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.980
Is to upload this video, this thumbnail.

26
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.410
To the storage.

27
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.340
Okay.

28
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.020
Now, to do this, all we just have to say is we can just copy this.

29
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.600
Copy.

30
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.050
Copy this.

31
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.430
And pastes.

32
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.400
And now we can sort of upload video to storage.

33
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.920
This is going to be upload image, right?

34
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.840
This is basically what we are doing.

35
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.240
We are getting the image from the video or you can basically call it some new.

36
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.680
Right.

37
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.940
Okay.

38
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.280
So they said, oh, this this is going to be did some you can just see Tom.

39
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.620
Some news.

40
00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.490
Right.

41
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.710
So I get some news and it's says, oh, this is going to be what's.

42
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.950
This called get.

43
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.430
You can just basically copy this.

44
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:11.340
Okay.

45
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.240
Great.

46
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.210
Okay.

47
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.210
And over here, we also need to return.

48
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.220
That Tom thumbnail.

49
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.890
Tom?

50
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.310
No.

51
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.010
Tom?

52
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.560
No.

53
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.100
Okay.

54
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.590
Funny, I can spell.

55
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.280
Okay, great.

56
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.560
Now, the next thing is to first of all, we can, as we'll start this results in a very bukod video

57
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.240
URL and squats to this and we can as well await this.

58
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.360
So now what we can just do is to copy this.

59
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.350
And here's this.

60
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.100
And this is going to be Tom.

61
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.430
No.

62
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.710
So no.

63
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.700
Okay.

64
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.520
Now, if you forgot to know what this does, you can basically just try to repeat this lecture in case

65
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.060
you forgot.

66
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.180
What's all this?

67
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.740
I forgot.

68
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.540
You forgot to all this processes.

69
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.710
Okay.

70
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.770
Okay.

71
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.580
This is basically it for now.

72
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.910
So in East Asia, rebels need to upload a video and everything to have these stories straight to the

73
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.670
cloud first.

74
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.870
Okay.

75
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.380
Now, for now, we can just use control.

76
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.640
And so we need to change this to upload.

77
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.220
Image.

78
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.640
Okay.

79
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.690
So now we can then use Contra and say, okay, okay guys, see you in the next lecture.
