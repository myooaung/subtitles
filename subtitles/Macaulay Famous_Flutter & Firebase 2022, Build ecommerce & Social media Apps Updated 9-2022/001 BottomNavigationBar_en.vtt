00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.839
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.620
In this lecture, we are going to create the bottom navigation bar.

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.130
Okay?

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.500
Now, what we can do is we can head over to the main to that file, and for the now, we can change

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
this to be the customer.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.510
Customer.

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.770
Home screen.

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.170
And we have to that.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.360
Well, let's restart and back to the customer home screen.

11
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.970
We can use control and bait to make this fight, and we have to get rid of this.

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
Center and even the body can just get rid of this for now.

13
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.630
Okay.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.170
Now, is control necessary?

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.880
And over here, we're going to have a bottom navigation bar.

16
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:59.460
Now, within the scaffold, the scaffold has a property known as bottom navigation bar.

17
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.970
And this is going to be bottom.

18
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.530
Bottom navigation bar.

19
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.930
Bottom navigation bar.

20
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.510
You can see it has a property known as items.

21
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.560
The item is basically referring to how many?

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.740
Bottom navigation bar we need or how many bottom navigation bar items we need and.

23
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.670
Over here within the list, we are going to say bottom navigation bar item.

24
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.910
And you can see it's asking for Nikon widgets.

25
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.890
There's going to be icon.

26
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.510
And I caused.

27
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.160
Dodds.

28
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.740
Home.

29
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.650
Home and the bottom navigation bar.

30
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.400
Hotham has well, has a property known as Bear.

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.090
So we're going to call this home and we can copy this.

32
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.910
And pasted.

33
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.490
It's three times and we have to have a trainer come out via the trainer come over here and the tree

34
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.950
will come away and we can use control and save.

35
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.750
Okay.

36
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.650
And we're going to change this to this is going to be.

37
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.410
Klutzy.

38
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.320
This is going to be.

39
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.750
We can just say such.

40
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.130
Search for now and.

41
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.180
This is going to be category.

42
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.180
You can just call this category.

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.930
Okay.

44
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.930
And for this, I'm just going to check this out.

45
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.250
You can see it over here.

46
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.880
You can see this, right?

47
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.520
Okay.

48
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.060
Okay.

49
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070
We just have to look for this.

50
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.530
This is going to be icons, dots.

51
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.520
Stores.

52
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.580
Because this tour of this store and this or we can just say, okay, let's check this icon out and see.

53
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.150
Okay.

54
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.630
Let's just use shop.

55
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.790
I consider the shop.

56
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.030
I caused the shop and you try and save.

57
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.900
Okay.

58
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.920
I think this is more better and this is going to be short.

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.280
Okay.

60
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.000
Now we can compete this again.

61
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.470
And paste this should be for.

62
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.450
The shopping cart so you can see it across the shop in Japan.

63
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.680
Chopin on the score cards.

64
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.560
So.

65
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.210
Who's going to do this?

66
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.540
Chopin on the score.

67
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.190
Cards.

68
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.010
Okay.

69
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.290
And this is going to be.

70
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.880
Cards.

71
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.840
Okay.

72
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.510
We need two more for.

73
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.160
The one more.

74
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.610
Can we have?

75
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.680
Okay.

76
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.050
You can just hide the trachoma.

77
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.130
How do you turn a coma and had your coma?

78
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.380
Okay.

79
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.860
We have one, two, three, four.

80
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.380
We can.

81
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.390
One, two, three, four.

82
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.500
So you can also duplicate this and paste.

83
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.440
Okay.

84
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.160
And this is going to be four icons.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.190
Person and.

88
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.960
How do you take over?

89
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.590
And this is going to be pro fi.

90
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.090
Okay.

91
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.590
Now you can try and save.

92
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.330
And you can see we can see this.

93
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:15.000
So what we can do is within the bottom navigation bar over here we can see selected.

94
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.040
So in order or via.

95
