00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.950
Walker.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.939
In this lecture, we're going to start creating the cut screen.

4
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.660
Okay.

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.990
Now, what we're going to need to do first is within the views that are tree, we are going to create

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.100
a new PHI.

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.250
And we're going to call this cards on the score.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.830
On the score screen.

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.480
And then the section is dot dot.

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
And now we can use control and be two make wide.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.810
And for the now we can just create a stateless widget.

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.390
And as well we're going to call this cut screen and over here we need to alight and use controller and

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
dots in order to impart the material to that package.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.290
Okay.

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.240
And in order to have access to a lot of property, what we can do is we can return a scaffold, widgets,

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.070
scaffold.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.430
And as you know, the scaffold has.

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.200
And I bar.

19
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.230
Oak Harbor.

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.300
Kabir.

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Okay.

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.670
We can use control and save.

23
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.410
Have your trailer, Kramer.

24
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.290
And we're going to go to the customer home screen.

25
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.350
The customer home screen.

26
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.030
Customer of screen and where we have.

27
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.480
This or that.

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.620
We have to get rid of this center and then we're going to use the cat screen we just created.

29
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.040
We have to then restart this.

30
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.310
Where to start this and.

31
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.570
We can then check this out.

32
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.460
We just have to wait for this, okay?

33
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.080
And we can then check this out.

34
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.130
Okay.

35
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.310
I think it has to start and cut screen.

36
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.100
The kick inside of the kid.

37
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.630
Back to the card screen.

38
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.470
And for the harbor, we're going to say background color.

39
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.870
This is going to be colours that white.

40
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.970
How did you recover and use control?

41
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.310
And that's the save.

42
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.050
And we're going to get rid of this elevation or this shadow.

43
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.470
To do that, they have our has this elevation property and we're going to set it to zero.

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.720
And we can then have a title.

45
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.190
Which is the test which has or which is going to be a test which it can basically take all the widgets

46
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.110
like you're going to call this cards and we can have this tie to this.

47
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:56.140
This tie, we could increase the font size to maybe 22 and I think we need one additional and use control

48
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.170
and save and default I think is currently we have to change the color to colors that's.

49
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.730
Black.

50
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.870
Look at the color and you're going to see it now.

51
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.680
Okay.

52
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680
Now, what we can do, we can take this to the middle.

53
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.630
We send the harbor.

54
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.130
The harbor has a property known as center title.

55
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.770
And we're going to set it to true default.

56
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.300
It is set to force.

57
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.520
You're going to see the value in that.

58
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.810
Okay, great.

59
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.680
And over a year we're going to have an icon in order to delete the cut item.

60
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.180
We have had that so far.

61
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.460
To do that so hard item via the harbor has a property known as actions.

62
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.220
Okay.

63
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.520
For the action is going to be an icon.

64
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.710
I combatant so we're going to make the high court clickable right so icon both in.

65
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.020
And the press.

66
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.310
Okay and this is going to be icon and we can then say icons dot.

67
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.280
I think we have an icon known as delete.

68
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.620
Delete.

69
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.550
Delete forever.

70
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.240
Had this over there.

71
00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.529
I think we need an additional in this country and they save and go check it out.

72
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.660
So you're going to see the wire.

73
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.650
Okay.

74
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.140
I think they thought the color is white.

75
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.980
So we have to say color and colors the black.

76
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.200
Okay.

77
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.850
And use consciousness to save each country and be.

78
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.090
Look, you can sit over there, okay?

79
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.080
And now we're going to deal with the body.

80
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:48.740
Look, we tell the scaffold, we have the body property and for the body we are basically going to have

81
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.050
two main widgets, which is going to be a test and a button.

82
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.270
So we are going to display them vertically.

83
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.980
That is from top to bottom.

84
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.640
So the bottom the board is going to have this column.

85
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440
Column.

86
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.060
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets.

87
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.340
And the first child is going to be a test.

88
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.260
We just and it's basically just going to say your.

89
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.070
Your card is empty.

90
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.470
Okay, go check it out.

91
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.860
What we can do.

92
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.170
We can wrap this with a center, with jets, and it's going to take it to the center.

93
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.610
And the column has this main axis alignment.

94
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.410
You can then say main US alignment, dot center.

95
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.700
Okay.

96
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.560
You know what this is going to do?

97
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.090
Okay.

98
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.460
And we can increase the.

99
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.030
Give some STI.

100
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.890
Yes to STI.

101
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.790
And we can increase the font size to maybe.

102
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.390
Full size to maybe 30 and how the chain of command.

103
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.630
And.

104
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.180
Okay.

105
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.310
The thing that is cool.

106
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.870
Or maybe we can give you a call or two.

107
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.410
This can say.

108
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.810
CALLER This is going to be callers that.

109
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.620
Gray or maybe blue.

110
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.210
Gray.

111
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.740
Blue.

112
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.310
Gray.

113
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.060
And I think it's way too dark.

114
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.100
I think this is okay.

115
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.650
And now we can then have that button.

116
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.370
For the both hand, we can start creating from scratch.

117
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.400
We can just use a widget known as Materia.

118
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.000
We are both in.

119
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.130
Okay.

120
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.050
It does all take the press and also a child which is not really required.

121
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.480
You can see we do not really need to pass that child, but we have to pass the child.

122
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.580
And it's going to say.

123
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.220
Continue.

124
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.770
Continue shopping.

125
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.310
We could continue shopping.

126
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.190
It's okay.

127
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.550
And maybe we can see this.

128
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.180
We can't really see this.

129
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.040
We can't really see the button until we click on it.

130
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:41.110
So what we can do, we can wrap this within Syria, which is similar, which is kind of similar to that

131
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.800
of the container, because it also has this color property.

132
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.810
We can see colors that.

133
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.130
Said the case contained excessive.

134
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.950
Okay.

135
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.560
You can see it now and.

136
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:03.460
Now the material also has this border radius, but you can see we do not really need to have the decoration

137
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.650
and the box decoration.

138
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.480
So that should be one of the reason you would want to use a material instead of a container.

139
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.130
Okay.

140
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.150
That circle are of maybe 15.

141
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.840
Hide the camera and go check it out.

142
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.640
Look, you can see.

143
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.200
Okay.

144
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.190
We can have this tie to this and test tie.

145
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.280
And we can change the color to colors.

146
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:38.030
That's why it's like I teach in Tacoma and youth culture and ask to save.

147
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.710
Okay.

148
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.710
Maybe we could increase the font size to maybe 710.

149
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.920
And check it out.

150
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.230
You just have to check.

151
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.220
And we can also increase the.

152
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.040
The button to do that.

153
00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.820
The.

154
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.820
I think.

155
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.040
We tell.

156
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.010
The material, but then it has the mass.

157
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:10.980
Yeah.

158
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.010
Mean weeds.

159
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.170
Then you should have the.

160
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.970
Yeah, I think main weeds.

161
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.160
This is going to be a media query.

162
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:29.250
The tough contest that sides the Swedes and we're going to chance it by 0.6.

163
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.630
Okay.

164
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.580
Okay, great.

165
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600
And now we can give you space between this.

166
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.420
Your cards is empty.

167
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.060
And this to do that over here.

168
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.940
Okay then oversized box and we are given the space vertically.

169
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.960
So this is going to be height, height of maybe 40.

170
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.460
We're just trying this.

171
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.300
Okay.

172
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.020
I think it's way too far.

173
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.270
We could just say maybe 30.

174
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.800
Okay.

175
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.690
I think this is okay.

176
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.820
Now, instead of using this button, you could also create yours from scratch.

177
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.550
I think I should shown you that before.

178
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:19.080
We could get rid of this or copied to clipboard and we could have a container and.

179
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.440
We can then have a decoration box decoration.

180
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.810
And see color, maybe colors that can.

181
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:32.700
Right.

182
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.510
And.

183
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.930
We could then have.

184
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.980
Just trying to show you this again.

185
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.030
You can then have.

186
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.400
The child, which is going to be a test and you can say continue on.

187
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.620
Klein.

188
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.620
Can't continue Chopin.

189
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.100
Okay.

190
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.090
Check it out.

191
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.330
Okay.

192
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.570
And we can give this container a height of 40.

193
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.660
And media query we can.

194
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:17.150
So we could get the width of our screen media query that's of contest the size dot width and we could

195
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.380
-40.

196
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:24.160
We basically get to the entire width of our screen, then we are -40 from it in.

197
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.190
Go check it out.

198
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.300
Look, you can see now and it's way too big.

199
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.890
It's way too wide.

200
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.510
You could just say maybe.

201
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.060
Ted.

202
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.030
See all 20.

203
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.610
Okay.

204
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.030
So this is basically it.

205
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.400
And we can.

206
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.120
Make this rounded, as you know.

207
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.940
By did this and other ideas.

208
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.150
But our ideas.

209
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.870
That circular of 15.

210
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.200
Okay.

211
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.660
So this is another way to create buttons.

212
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.510
Right.

213
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.140
Okay.

214
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.210
And we can just send out this.

215
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.500
I'm basically just showing you center.

216
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.960
So it's going to be at the container.

217
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:14.970
Okay.

218
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.670
You can see it seems good, right?

219
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.890
And we can change the color.

220
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.550
I'm just going to stop here and to make this text clickable or to make this container clickable.

221
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:33.600
What we can just do is to wrap this with a button, which could be a gesture detector.

222
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.280
And.

223
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.570
On top.

224
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.940
This, this.

225
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.410
Okay, same thing, right?

226
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:42.460
Okay.

227
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:48.570
So what we simply did was to just use a widget instead of creating it from scratch.

228
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.410
So this is a mastering course.

229
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:57.430
So you're basically going to learn how to do everything and you also learn how to master everything

230
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:04.930
so you could use this method or you could just get rid of this and use that as a sentence.

231
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:11.650
Most of the time you just have to try this weeds and hide yourself to get the best shape you want.

232
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.920
Okay.

233
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.200
I think this is.

234
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.120
Pretty much.

235
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.830
Cool.

236
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.780
Okay.

237
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.420
In the next lecture, we are then going to create the bottom --.

238
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.560
Okay, guys.
