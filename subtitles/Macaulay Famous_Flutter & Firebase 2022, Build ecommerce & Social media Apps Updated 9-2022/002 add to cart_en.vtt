00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.930
Worker in this lecture we are going to continue for we always start well before then in the last lecture

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.250
we created a function called at Project Zuccotti.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.790
And over here we are simply saying if the product has already been added, that's means there is no

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.780
need of adding that product.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.940
Again, always just wants the issue of date, the quantity of that product.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.570
Right?

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.530
But if that product has not been had that then we now want to had that product.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
So over here, rather than need to say else.

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.510
If the product has not been added, they are going to call it this is caught on the scorecards.

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.350
Items.

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.470
Then dots puts.

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.400
So it says landlords.

14
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.010
Put.

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.140
If upsets.

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.320
You can see, as the name implies, that's maize.

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.640
The product has not yet been added and now we want to hide that product.

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.980
Okay.

19
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.360
The key is going to be the product idea writes.

20
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.890
Okay.

21
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.440
And this is going to be the cots attributes, which is the COTS model.

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.700
Okay.

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.340
Now, we can't just get rid of all this and do it ourselves.

24
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.620
Get rid of all this.

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.540
Okay.

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.190
And BRCA2 in this line.

27
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.610
Okay.

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.140
Now, first of all, you're going to need to have the hiding of the products.

29
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.580
Okay.

30
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.270
The idea is going to be what we can just do.

31
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.740
We can generate a unique ID by using the date.

32
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.100
Date time that now.

33
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.720
Sorry.

34
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.800
We need to cover this district by saying don't just drink.

35
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.760
Okay.

36
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.200
Great.

37
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.130
Now the nest we need is.

38
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.640
And then they try to base on the tie, too.

39
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.090
Okay.

40
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.419
So this is going to be tied to.

41
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.850
You can see where Eddie passed away, right?

42
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.400
There's going to be the, let's say, prize.

43
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.310
It's going to be prized as well.

44
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.430
And this is going to be quantity.

45
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.560
The it is going to be one.

46
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.030
Okay.

47
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.770
And this is going to be immeasurable.

48
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.080
And image Jarrell real.

49
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.800
Okay.

50
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.550
Great.

51
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.540
Adios cynical eye as it's nice culture and safe.

52
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.260
Now this is basically.

53
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.500
It's.

54
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.280
Now, if you are confused about this, I'm just a technical I'm just going to upload a lecture.

55
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.870
Before this two videos, I just made Mallory upload that lecture.

56
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.920
So you see all this first because I know you're going to be confused.

57
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.340
Okay.

58
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.480
Okay.

59
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.360
So this is basically it's sort of where we are simply saying, if you can see what is in this call is

60
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.680
key to over here, we are simply checking if the product ID is already existing.

61
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.480
Then we just want to update the court's.

62
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.610
Court TV rights by what you can see by two.

63
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.100
Okay.

64
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.070
Well, it's definitely got to be what else if that product as being did you can see guys are this meta

65
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.550
called puts if opposites.

66
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.400
Okay so if it does not mean that then we want to that hard that could be up to them courts.

67
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.780
Okay.

68
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.640
Sorry, I don't think we have did courts.

69
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.390
Okay.

70
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.250
We just have to hide the you cover.

71
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.200
And that you cover.

72
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.430
And is and is safe.

73
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.730
Okay.

74
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.010
So that is basically all we need.

75
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.540
That's the dates, the courts.

76
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.960
And, you know, that's a hard product to cut.

77
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.570
If we don't see this done, I think it's a bit fine.

78
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.860
You can as all.

79
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.430
The wall to message me, dear.

80
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.540
It's not for me to try my best to explain to you.

81
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.899
Okay?

82
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.310
Okay, guys.

83
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.570
See the investiture?
