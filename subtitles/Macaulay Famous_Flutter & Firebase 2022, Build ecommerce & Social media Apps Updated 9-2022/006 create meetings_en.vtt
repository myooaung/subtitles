00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.380
In this lecture, we're going to create the function in order to enable users create maintenance.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.770
Okay.

5
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.360
Now, to do this, we're going to need to go to the controllers directory and over this controllers,

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.380
that tree, we're going to create a new file and we're going to call this phi jets c meets.

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.560
Then on this call controller and then there's texture, the dots, and now we can then use culture and

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.490
beat and make this way.

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.030
Okay.

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.140
Now, the first step is within the creative class and as we call this class Jets jet.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.900
See Mits then controller.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.600
Okay.

13
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.450
Now the second step is to create the function and you're going to call this function create method.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.430
Okay.

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.640
They're going to be using the airwaves.

16
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.770
So we need to pass in the risk of air.

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.010
Okay.

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.420
Now, all we can do is we can head up to Brezza and then pop the dab.

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.730
And why doesn't the copy.

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.080
Okay.

21
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.200
I think this.

22
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.620
Okay.

23
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.269
Okay.

24
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.320
That is the witness screen and.

25
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.180
Now we can.

26
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.180
Okay.

27
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.770
We can copy this from this.

28
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.240
Try and answer.

29
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.650
Right.

30
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.910
Okay.

31
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.120
The last call.

32
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.460
The bracket is for this.

33
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.800
Okay.

34
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.410
So we can copy and.

35
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.160
Then is this?

36
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.170
Okay.

37
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.340
So I think.

38
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.870
Okay.

39
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.830
Coffee?

40
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.680
And.

41
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.920
Okay now what we can do is a light and use controlled dots in the that's it.

42
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.840
But it's okay.

43
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.130
Okay as well.

44
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.310
A light and in parts.

45
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.070
Okay, great.

46
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.200
This is not the book print.

47
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.850
We are going to say print, right?

48
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.870
That is what we have.

49
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.010
Print and again going need to get rid of this.

50
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.360
And.

51
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.130
As well.

52
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.820
Over in this area, you can see it was just the pass they required field known as room.

53
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.000
That's going to be the room name.

54
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.680
Okay.

55
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.450
And now we can get rid of this.

56
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.150
So.

57
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.400
Okay.

58
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.320
Get rid of that.

59
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.540
Okay.

60
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.900
He's asking for the room name.

61
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.230
Now we can easily just say my room.

62
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.390
And that's means every room created is going to be at this my room.

63
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.900
So what we can do is we can make it dynamic.

64
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.990
So over this function called creates within.

65
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.280
We can have the parenthesis and then say room.

66
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.330
Rome.

67
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.690
Real can just say real name.

68
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.310
Right.

69
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.820
Okay.

70
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.680
Now, we can then specify the type of data it's going to be.

71
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.300
It says says in the B string and as well we can make this required.

72
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
So any time we call this creates its own function, we're going to need to pass the value.

73
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.630
So it's okay now over here to condense a wrong.

74
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.580
Romney.

75
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.070
Okay.

76
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.460
Great.

77
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.450
Now the zoom.

78
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.470
Does that has this.

79
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.120
Hold this, hold you.

80
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.510
Hold this.

81
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.740
We can get rid of this.

82
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.130
And it turns you now.

83
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.790
So we need to add our semicolon.

84
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.000
Okay as well.

85
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.450
We can get rid of this.

86
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.820
Okay, great.

87
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.280
Now all we can do as well is sort of say true.

88
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.240
We can also create a dynamic table for this.

89
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.000
So over here you can either try the cover and you can say is.

90
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.510
Or do.

91
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.720
His ordeal.

92
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.140
Mute said.

93
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.340
Right.

94
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.180
And here's what they do.

95
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.440
It.

96
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.680
Okay.

97
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.370
You can okay as well.

98
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.210
We can make this required and this is a data type of move because it's going to be the true or false

99
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.690
value.

100
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.550
As well.

101
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.120
You can see both.

102
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.180
Okay, great.

103
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.220
So they said, oh, this revenue card is.

104
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.290
Is audio muted and.

105
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.050
This video.

106
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.670
Muted.

107
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.490
Okay, now we can just get rid of the seven year outlook.

108
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.100
You can see our code is becoming more concise and we can use control and this is said to be very good

109
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.580
format.

110
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.970
Okay.

111
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.640
Now as well.

112
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.770
We can get rid of the subjects.

113
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.850
We don't really need this.

114
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.150
Okay.

115
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.730
We can't use control necessary.

116
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.790
Now, what we have is the use of the spleen in.

117
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.120
The user email and the user avatar.

118
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.820
All we can do is we can get the correct logged in user details.

119
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.760
So to do this, first of all, we need to go to the.

120
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.690
Hot controller.

121
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.930
Right.

122
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.270
Okay.

123
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.230
Now you're going to do this right after.

124
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.700
Yeah.

125
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.780
Okay.

126
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.740
They're going to say user.

127
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.440
The user's referring to the hot user.

128
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.060
Okay.

129
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.340
The hearts user.

130
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.300
Okay.

131
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.520
And we can then see.

132
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.580
So that we can then see.

133
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.650
Gets user.

134
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.620
Then use no function and we can't call the available card on this for hearts.

135
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.540
Then Dot's current user.

136
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.450
Okay.

137
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.530
Okay.

138
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.390
You can see it can be.

139
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.720
No.

140
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.810
Think.

141
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.970
Okay.

142
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.350
Okay.

143
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.890
And now we need to do it so we can just use control.

144
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.310
And that's to save and.

145
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.120
We can just go to.

146
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.670
Okay.

147
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.210
First of all, we need to know that you have access to this river card user.

148
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.550
We need to have access to this ODS controller.

149
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.960
Right.

150
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.400
Okay.

151
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.940
So maybe we can initialize it because if our and you can just go to the specify the type, it's going

152
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.410
to be Hods controller and.

153
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.320
It's going to be on this car controller and it costs the hearts controller.

154
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.190
Okay.

155
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.640
Okay.

156
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.410
And.

157
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.280
Instead of this, we can get rid of this and call the others.

158
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.060
Cards.

159
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.970
Controller the cards.

160
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.090
I says to use their paper, and now we can say this cleaning.

161
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.060
Okay.

162
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.130
Okay.

163
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.260
I think we need this.

164
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.360
Now, what we can do is.

165
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.260
We can.

166
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.480
Okay.

167
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.210
Over here.

168
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.980
Okay.

169
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.450
We can just go ahead and hide this.

170
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.230
And in this picture, I to show you how to do this in a separate way.

171
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.580
Okay.

172
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.750
Okay.

173
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.610
Over in this, I think.

174
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.120
Uh.

175
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.110
So comma.

176
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.000
I think, okay, we don't need any cover.

177
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.410
Okay.

178
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.590
And we're going to need to call the others car parts.

179
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.070
Controller and darts.

180
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.530
User and darts.

181
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.220
What email.

182
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.410
Okay.

183
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.010
As well.

184
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.580
We can't had this.

185
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.210
Okay.

186
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.390
And in this picture you're going to see on how to not hide this.

187
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:38.760
Okay.

188
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.730
Okay.

189
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:47.760
