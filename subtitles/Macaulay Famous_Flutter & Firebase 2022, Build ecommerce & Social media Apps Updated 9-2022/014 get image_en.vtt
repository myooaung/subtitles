00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.569
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.320
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.250
We're going to purge the rest of the fields.

4
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.130
Okay, then I'd like to do this.

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.630
I need to go back to our visa code and then it provides screen.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.180
Okay.

7
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.820
And now we can use Cointreau.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.270
Sorry.

9
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.040
Ice cream.

10
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.870
Now we can use contra and B to make this right.

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.290
Okay.

12
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.740
Now over year recognizes string.

13
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.220
Right.

14
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.920
You can say he's going to be no for now.

15
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.570
So he can just create a report card.

16
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.580
An escort image.

17
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.610
Image.

18
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.600
Yara.

19
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.410
Okay.

20
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.720
Then over a year.

21
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.710
Every call that we're able to call or score image.

22
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.250
Sorry.

23
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.830
Image l the according to this.

24
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.610
Variable rates is a deter and that gets I think we have it ours image.

25
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.900
Okay so make sure you don't make a mistake of that as you're going to get it back to this area.

26
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.990
Image.

27
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.560
No, really, we don't need the full name because we don't have anything.

28
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.010
I sort of I really do have the email address, the user name and number, but that you can just add

29
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.910
the phone number in your sign up screen.

30
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.450
Okay.

31
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.190
Okay.

32
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.750
So what we can do is we're going to need to display the image.

33
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.160
Right.

34
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.570
Okay.

35
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.540
I think.

36
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.000
Over.

37
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.450
Over.

38
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.170
Okay.

39
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.910
Over here.

40
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.570
We're going to call it out very well.

41
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.550
We can just use this and use a dollar sign and dancing on underscore image.

42
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.300
You are l.

43
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.590
Yeah.

44
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.490
Okay.

45
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.270
Not hard to restart this part.

46
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.240
Restarting or restarting.

47
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.780
Okay.

48
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.410
But that you.

49
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.340
Okay.

50
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.790
Or we look at computers.

51
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.150
Okay.

52
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.200
Okay.

53
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.500
Ice cream.

54
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.240
Let's see if we.

55
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.770
Okay.

56
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.250
Great.

57
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.320
It is done, right.

58
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.680
Okay.

59
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.200
Now we can then have the sign, the log out, both in the log guard function.

60
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.550
Okay.

61
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.960
So we're going to look for that.

62
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.410
Okay.

63
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.090
I think we do have it over here.

64
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.120
It is my orders and.

65
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.740
Little guy.

66
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.460
Okay, so this is a function of air.

67
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.320
Right?

68
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.780
You already have.

69
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.420
You sink.

70
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.760
If for any reason the garbage, you can just hide it.

71
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.100
Okay.

72
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.560
So we're going to see Firebase.

73
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.850
I think we have available quite far besides intercourse and thought.

74
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.780
Sign.

75
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.340
Sign.

76
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.880
How?

77
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.470
Okay.

78
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.780
Okay.

79
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.710
This is going to take some time, so we need to wait for it.

80
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.080
Okay?

81
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.560
This country has to save or we can just as we start this.

82
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.500
Okay.

83
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.490
Okay.

84
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.420
Okay, okay.

85
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.460
Okay.

86
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.530
Alright, we started.

87
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.940
Okay.

88
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.630
And.

89
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.770
Now we can.

90
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.580
You can see it is taking some time for the image to load.

91
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.000
You can just hide something else before it's finished loading.

92
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.370
Okay, let's try to.

93
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.450
Second in line.

94
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.110
Okay.

95
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.730
Now the sign up.

96
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.140
Look for the sign off.

97
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.560
We can just add that additional field, which is the number of.
