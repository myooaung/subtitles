00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.020
Ise welcome.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.930
In this lecture we are going to create the login screen for the seller.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.920
Now over this order directory, we are going to create a new file and we are going to call this file

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.180
seller on the score, log in on the score screen and the section is the dots.

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.240
The seller's login screen is going to be similar to that of the customer login screen.

6
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.920
So what we can do, we can head up to the customer log in screen and use contra and eight to alight

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.810
and use contra and C to copy and over the London customer.

8
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.330
Sorry, over the seller's login screen.

9
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.110
We can use control and B to make the slide and use control and V to paste.

10
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.520
Okay.

11
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.940
And now we have to rename this.

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.190
And to easily do that, we can alight and use controller and the controller and the controller and D

13
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.980
to highlight all the stimuli names.

14
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.470
And I think that is all.

15
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.750
And now this is going to be seller.

16
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.320
Log in and screen.

17
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.540
Okay.

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.720
And over here we can create a root name.

19
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.300
You can basically just do this for all the screens.

20
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.320
And now let's make this variable globally accessible.

21
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.390
We are going to make it static.

22
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.530
Static and it is a constant and we are expecting the test.

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.820
So it is a type of string and we are going to call this variable root name and it's going to be equal

24
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.480
to.

25
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.090
Sellers.

26
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.510
Sorry.

27
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.390
Seller login and screen adjust semicolon.

28
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.080
And the next step is to tell the end of that file.

29
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.550
We just added this route.

30
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.810
So back to the main ..5.

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.250
And over here, trendy and London words.

32
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.200
Sorry, not London, but Sailor Logan.

33
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.810
Screen.

34
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.820
That rude name and it's going to take the contest.

35
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.260
In the view we can then say what?

36
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.090
They can then say London.

37
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.730
London.

38
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.280
Sorry.

39
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.720
I don't know why I'm saying London.

40
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.580
Seller Logan.

41
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.090
Screen.

42
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.710
Hopefully we get another prediction for this.

43
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.940
See the log in screen seems good.

44
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.380
I did try.

45
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.430
Cover is control save and.

46
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.160
Over here.

47
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.720
You can see we can basically.

48
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.280
Click on this to take us to the cave.

49
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.180
Currently we will not fish that to take us back to the customers accounts.

50
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.430
That is, if we do not want a customer's account, we can then click on this to take us back to where

51
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.240
the.

52
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.040
So if we do not need a seller's account, we can then click on this to take us back to the customers

53
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.820
section where we can then create a customer's account.

54
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.060
To do that, we have to head back to this screen.

55
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.080
Right.

56
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.740
Okay.

57
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.100
That is the London seller.

58
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:37.040
Screen and we need to scroll down and this is going to be create customer.

59
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.400
It can just get rid of that A and then say customer customer's account is constrained to save.

60
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.640
Okay.

61
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.790
You can see.

62
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.790
We can just.

63
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.150
I think.

64
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.600
Right.

65
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.710
Sorry.

66
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.750
This is the cellar.

67
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.620
Log in.

68
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.220
Is going to do this.

69
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.590
And London silver screen.

70
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.790
Then scroll down.

71
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.550
Then this is going to be customer.

72
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.390
Customer.

73
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.760
These conferences save.

74
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.740
Or do we have to restart?

75
00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.150
Or to start this.

76
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.870
To start thing and we have to wait for this.

77
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.600
Okay.

78
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.500
Sorry for the delay and we'll check it out.

79
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.420
It's going to take us back to the customers screen because that is the initial screen.

80
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.300
And I don't want a customer's account, so I'm going to click on this to create a seller's account.

81
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.680
Okay.

82
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.430
You can see now create a.

83
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.070
Customers accounts, but I want the seller's account or I had already created an account.

84
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.960
Then I have to go to where the log in to log in the seller's account.

85
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.470
Right.

86
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.690
To do that over here.

87
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.470
First of all, we can just have the function to go back to the customers accounts in case the user does

88
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.120
not need the seller's account navigate to.

89
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.910
Hopefully I don't mess things up and hopefully understand what I'm trying to say.

90
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.230
Navigator.

91
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.770
Sorry, not the gator.

92
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.240
Dot words.

93
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.350
That we can just say.

94
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.530
Push, since we have not created any roots name for doubts and.

95
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.270
This is going to be material page.

96
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.100
Roots.

97
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.240
And it's going to take in contest.

98
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.730
So you can see basically there are varieties of ways to use navigation.

99
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.980
And now we're going to need to say return words, return customer.

100
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.330
So return what?

101
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.390
London.

102
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.560
London.

103
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.340
London customer.

104
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.420
Or what we called that.

105
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.350
London.

106
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.710
Customer.

107
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.940
Screen.

108
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.570
Okay.

109
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.740
And we can just how to start this and definitely it's going to work as planned.

110
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.990
Then back to the seller's.

111
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.430
London silver screen.

112
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.550
So look over the log in section.

113
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.140
If you already have a seller account, then we want to be able to log in.

114
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.010
Right.

115
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.990
So we have to head up to where we have that already have an account and you can see this is the function

116
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:54.610
for it and we want to go to where get rid of this or we can just get rid of this function in general.

117
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.580
And we're going to use Navigator.

118
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.590
Though it's pushing them because we just created a name for that.

119
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.210
Right.

120
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.830
So this is going to be push name.

121
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.700
And we want to go to where the.

122
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.080
Sailor.

123
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.940
Log in.

124
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.850
Log in screen.

125
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.810
Okay.

126
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.810
So dot rude name like this.

127
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.410
And now what we can do over the cell along is screen.

128
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.420
We can then do some changes.

129
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.300
Like I told you, you are going to be easier that way in this section.

130
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.630
And the reason for this is so you understand varieties of ways in order to implement the same thing.

131
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.600
Like We can't get feed.

132
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.610
Of this, we basically need the password visible.

133
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.800
Right.

134
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.450
And.

135
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.110
Get rid.

136
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.070
Of it over here.

137
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.020
And get rid of this controller.

138
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.500
They call this.

139
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.210
Get rid of this.

140
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.010
Get rid of this.

141
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.560
And yeah, we can just get rid of this for now.

142
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.060
Like you can see where I'm copying from, right?

143
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.090
Where am I writing from?

144
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:30.990
So you don't make mistake by saying if it's a slow day, then all they want to show this, else I want

145
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.030
to show this test.

146
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.320
And for the lab, we can just get rid of this.

147
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.480
Okay.

148
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.590
And get rid of this is just one is necessary.

149
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.350
And we're going to need to change.

150
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.950
We have to change the test.

151
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.190
To sign into what to sell us.

152
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.250
Sellers.

153
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.180
Okay, all three, start this.

154
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.300
And that is basically all we need.

155
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:06.350
And we do not really need this right, because we basically do not want to assess any function within

156
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.590
the old controller class.

157
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.820
And hopefully you understand all of this.

158
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.480
Okay.

159
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:21.860
We're currently at the customer screen and I want to be a seller.

160
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.370
Right.

161
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.870
So I have to click on.

162
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.450
When you have an account, it's going to take us to where the.

163
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.370
Sign in into customers accounts.

164
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:31.910
Okay.

165
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.890
Or need an account.

166
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.030
It's going to take us back to the Create Customers accounts, but I don't want to be a customer.

167
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.700
Rather, I want to be a seller.

168
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.640
So I have to click on this create seller's accounts.

169
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.770
But I already have an account, so I'm going to click on what?

170
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.000
I already have an account.

171
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.430
Okay.

172
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.000
Sounds good.

173
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.780
And hopefully you understand all this, but if you don't, you can let me know.

174
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.750
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
