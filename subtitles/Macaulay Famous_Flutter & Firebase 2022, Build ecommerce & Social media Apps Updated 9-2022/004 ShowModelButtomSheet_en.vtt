00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.480
Now, what we are going to be doing this lecture is if the user chooses the catch on delivery and click

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.630
on confirm, we want to display something known as show model bottom sheds.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.920
To do this over here within the material button, we can get rid of this.

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.930
And the next step is to know the radio button the user is currently selecting.

7
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.570
To do this, we need an EVE statement where so we can say if and we can call that variable we have above

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.050
called.

9
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.930
Selected, selected.

10
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.870
Selected item.

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.210
If it is equal to one, it means this is the first radio button.

12
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.930
The user just choose.

13
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.530
If it is equal to one.

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.370
We want to display something known as show model.

15
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.530
Bottom --.

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.710
The beta will always take in something known as contest.

17
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.060
And what we can then do is we can return a size box, can basically just use a container.

18
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.820
It is very similar and the way I think we need this and why we need that.

19
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.390
And also we can give the size box a height.

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.120
That is how long the shoe model bottom sheet is going to be.

21
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.080
And in order to make it more responsive, we can get the height of the screen by saying media query

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.900
that of contest the size, then the height and we just want to times it by zero.

23
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.890
The 30.

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.540
Okay.

25
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.500
Is controller and save.

26
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.980
And.

27
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.570
Okay.

28
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.620
And now we choose this catch on delivery.

29
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.200
Click on confirm.

30
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:08.120
Okay, Cisco and within the sandbox we can then have the chat property and basically we need two main

31
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.639
widget.

32
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.080
One is going to be a test with that and the other is going to be the button where the user is finally

33
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.030
going to be able to place the order.

34
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.210
So this is going to be column because those two widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

35
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.500
Children.

36
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.920
And this is going to be a test jet and it's going to just say payment.

37
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.870
Payment.

38
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.650
Payment from anywhere.

39
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.520
From anywhere.

40
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.280
Okay.

41
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.910
We can start this.

42
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.240
Sorry.

43
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.840
The STI.

44
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.600
This is going to be test i.

45
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.030
This STI oc.

46
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.830
Okay.

47
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.000
We could increase the font size to maybe 20.

48
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.160
Okay.

49
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.320
I think you already know how this is going to display.

50
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.760
Right.

51
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.350
Okay.

52
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.340
And now we can have the button.

53
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.510
We cannot be contained in order to stay the button.

54
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.950
And we can give this button or the container height of 35.

55
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.460
I think you've seen all this before.

56
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.270
And also, we can give this a width.

57
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.300
I think we it we give that that from a button width of 0 to 90.

58
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.630
Or what we can just do is we can copy everything over its increase.

59
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.680
So from the width.

60
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.880
Down to the box decoration class.

61
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.420
Okay.

62
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.100
And most of the time you just have to do it from scratch in order for it to get used to you.

63
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.400
You can't be a programmer writing just.

64
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.640
One time code.

65
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.950
You have to do it repeatedly in order for it to get used to you.

66
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.490
Okay.

67
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.700
So we're basically given this container a height of 35 and a weight doesn't make it responsive.

68
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.130
We said media query lots of content sizes with advertising adviser that 90 and we are given this a a

69
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.459
decoration box decoration and color colors assigned.

70
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.050
Remember we are basically using the decoration in order to have access to a lot of property.

71
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.530
The container has and you can see we are giving this a body radius to make it a bit rounded.

72
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.280
Okay.

73
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.370
Now.

74
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.120
Let's go check it out.

75
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.410
Click on confirm again.

76
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.700
Okay, great.

77
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.190
And we the container, we can then have a chart.

78
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.630
It's going to be a material.

79
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.790
Material button.

80
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.160
It's always taking the oppressed because it is a function or it is a button.

81
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.540
You definitely need to click it and the chart.

82
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.220
We can just go ahead and say center.

83
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.010
And that doesn't make sure the test starts the middle and we can then have a test which is going to

84
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.880
say pay.

85
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.890
Okay.

86
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.690
And also, we can give this title this.

87
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.230
Says.

88
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.900
Stay.

89
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.040
Okay.

90
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.760
We can increase the font size, so maybe a thin default is going to be black so we can change the color

91
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.570
to colors.

92
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.530
That's why.

93
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.540
Okay.

94
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.160
This country to save.

95
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.930
And so you had your train come up always in order to give it a very cool format.

96
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.730
Okay.

97
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.810
Click on it again.

98
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.840
Okay.

99
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.600
Confirm.

100
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.160
Okay.

101
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.980
You can see the over here.

102
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.440
And what we can also do is we can make it have equal space.

103
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:58.330
To do this, we have to go to the column and we can then say this element axis alignment.

104
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.460
Dot space equally okay to have equal space.

105
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.180
And remember the main element is going to work differently or explicitly for the row.

106
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.600
When using the main axis element for the row, it's going to make it go horizontally, right?

107
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.900
But for the column, it's going to make it go vertically.

108
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.780
So we are basically saying we want to give equal space between these two widgets vertically.

109
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.890
Right.

110
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.490
Okay.

111
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.390
Click on this again and this is cool.

112
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.020
And also we can display the prize and I think you've seen this before.

113
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.610
What you can just do is.

114
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.520
You know, that's a is a variable and it says we need a dollar sign.

115
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.490
And this and this is to to.

116
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:56.120
So it's a paid I think we call this top aide and we can then say dots a string as fixed and we need

117
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.770
to zero.

118
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.370
Okay.

119
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.240
And let's go check this out.

120
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.530
And let's go check this out.

121
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.050
Click on this and confirm.

122
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.890
Okay.

123
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.200
Okay, guys.

124
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.100
See you in the next lecture.
