00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.430
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.750
In this section, we are going to create the payment screen.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.610
Now, what we want to do is when we click on this confirm, we want to go to the payment screen.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.570
To do this, we can just create this new file within the minor screens directory.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.710
All right.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:33.840
We are going to call this payment under the screen and the dot, and we can create this that let's do

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.140
that.

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.700
And here the needs arise.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:44.880
We can convert it to a stateful widgets payment screen and via a light and use control node.

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.280
Okay.

12
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.380
And for now we can just say color and this is going to be colors.

13
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.110
The sign is control and save.

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:05.140
And back to the place order screen is controller and B and where we have this.

15
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.290
Not Syria, but then we can then say now they get their.

16
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.860
Navigate the dirt of contest that push.

17
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.760
Or you can just go ahead and say, my navigator, that push and now we need to pass the material page.

18
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.400
Page root and.

19
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.170
Comcast.

20
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.080
Okay.

21
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.600
And basically, we want to return the payment screen.

22
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.490
Okay.

23
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.830
Pittman's got another prediction and use culture and that's to save.

24
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.670
And.

25
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.100
Okay.

26
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.180
And now we just have to click on this.

27
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.850
Okay, Cisco.

28
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.400
And what we can also do is.

29
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.419
We can get rid of this.

30
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.850
And in order to have access to a lot of property, we can then return a scaffold which which is basically

31
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.250
going to give us that wide background and a lots of properties.

32
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.400
We have access to property like Harbour.

33
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.460
Harbour.

34
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.690
Okay.

35
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.130
All right.

36
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.240
We need this.

37
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.500
Use control and save.

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.830
And I think you already know how it's going to look like, right?

39
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.300
Okay.

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.190
Okay.

41
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.070
And we can change this color.

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.250
You can see currently this black powder is white and we can change the background color to have the

43
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.840
colors of whites.

44
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.710
And definitely we are not going to be able to see that higher anymore since the harbor has a background

45
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.900
color of whites.

46
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.010
So we can also specify our content and this is going to be icon pane.

47
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.960
I contain data.

48
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.180
I can't paint better.

49
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.310
And within the high quantum AI quantum data, it has the property known as color.

50
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.530
And for the color we can see colors.

51
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.940
The black oak.

52
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.640
In.

53
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.600
Go check this out.

54
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.830
Look, you can see currently it has a background of white and.

55
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.740
We can't see that icon anymore.

56
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.630
This is now of color.

57
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.410
Of color.

58
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.730
Black.

59
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.630
Sorry.

60
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.600
And we could also get rid of that elevation by saying the elevation is equal to zero.

61
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.930
Okay.

62
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.160
Great.

63
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.300
And it's going to match with this background.

64
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.120
Sims could.
