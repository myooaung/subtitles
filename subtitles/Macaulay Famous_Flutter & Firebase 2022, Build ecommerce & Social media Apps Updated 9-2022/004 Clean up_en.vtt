00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.690
In the last lecture, we talked about MVC and we said it stands for models, views, controllers.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.260
Right?

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.080
So in this lecture, we're going to do some cleanup.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.700
But before then over this views directory, we are going to create a new file.

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.670
Remember, we all agreed that this views directory is where we're going to be creating all our screens.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.930
Now over this views directory, we're going to create a new file and we're going to call this file landing,

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.980
underscore customer on the score screen and then this section dot dot.

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.110
The landing of screen is going to be the first screen the customer is going to see.

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.290
And now we can use control and beat, make this wide.

12
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.130
And over here, we can create a list, widgets.

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.480
And as well we can call this landing customer, then screen and overlay.

14
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.379
What we can simply do is alight in its controller and dot in order to import the material that's packaged.

15
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.320
And that's to have access to lots more property.

16
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.580
What we can do is instead of returning a container, we can return a scaffold which at.

17
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.890
Scaffold.

18
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.530
Okay.

19
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.540
And now we have access to property like the body.

20
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.210
And for now, we can have a centre with jets.

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.520
Okay, child.

22
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
And it's going to be a test with jets and it's just going to say landing page.

23
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.220
In order to get rid of this other light.

24
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.350
What we can simply do is we can go to the analysis on the score options.

25
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.920
That over a year, all we just have to do is commit this house.

26
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.150
Okay.

27
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.230
Now we can go back to the middle of that file.

28
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.490
And get rid of this class called my home page.

29
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.290
Definitely we're going to have this area since this this is gone.

30
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.880
So now we can get rid of all this and use that page we just created landed.

31
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.830
London customers screen.

32
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.200
And what we can simply do is.

33
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.490
We start this.

34
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.120
Okay.

35
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.820
But before then, we can as well get rid of what we have.

36
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.470
That is this comment.

37
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.160
And.

38
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.920
This as well.

39
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.590
Okay.

40
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.310
Now go check out.

41
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.820
Buy up.

42
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.400
It's good that we started this book.

43
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.630
Great as well.

44
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.580
We can get rid of this the back burner.

45
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.760
So over here, within the material hub, we can say the bug should check mode better and we can set

46
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.450
it to false.

47
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.670
Default is true.

48
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.300
So that is why you say that.

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.610
And I use controls to save.

50
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.160
Okay.

51
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.960
Is God.

52
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.600
Okay, guys, see you at the next lecture.
