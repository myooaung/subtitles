Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.760
In this lecture, we're going to talk about a useful widget which is known as List View that builder.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.630
And the reason for this is because in the future we might have a little test over here which is going

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
to save us the category name and it could be endless.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.160
And in order to display sort and less tests, we need to use a property which is known as list view

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.820
the beta.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.230
Now over here you can see we are basically having a position with that.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.110
And what the position is going to basically do is it's going to tell us how this container is going

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.010
to be placed.

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.840
And you can see the position has a property which is known as bottom.

12
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.440
And over here we are basically setting that to zero that says we do not need any space at the bottom.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.820
So it's going to take this right to the hedge.

14
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.270
Okay.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.470
And as well, the position widget also has a property known as left right.

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.110
And we're also saying this is zero.

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.690
That is, we do not need any space at the left side and the position to house do also have a property

18
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.890
known as container.

19
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160
And we are basically saying how we're going to place this container.

20
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.520
Right.

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.970
Okay.

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.360
And now, as you know, the container has a property known as child.

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.580
And for the child, it's going to be this property you've not seen before.

24
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.890
This view, the builder, the item builder can take in two main properties.

25
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.800
That is the context and the index that is each test will basically have.

26
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.670
And this most of the time you don't really need to specify.

27
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.030
But we could say build contest.

28
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.000
And the index is basically referring to the first item or each test.

29
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.600
And so it's going to be a number so we can say it's.

30
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.080
Okay.

31
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.930
And over here we can then return.

32
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.920
It tests.

33
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.400
And maybe men at this.

34
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.230
I think we need that over there and use control and that's to save.

35
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.960
He's going to get rid of this.

36
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.750
Hopefully it's going to work with that.

37
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.150
He can see it over there, men and.

38
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.580
Do.

39
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.990
Currently it is endless.

40
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.270
Right.

41
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.280
And what we can do, we can limit this the least view.

42
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:54.910
The theater has a property known as item counts and we can just say we need several item use controls

43
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.540
to save.

44
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.060
And you can you're just going to see just seven.

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.800
And the list with the theater also has the scroll duration and four.

46
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.130
Default is going to take the vertical shape that is from top to bottom.

47
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.800
But you can also see as this.

48
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.800
Has this got a visitor to take the horizontal shape that is from left to right.

49
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.620
And this way you can see it now.

50
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.210
And you can see we can scroll just like this.

51
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.740
Okay.

52
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.360
We just want the vertical shape so we can just get rid of that.

53
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.710
And you can see the right now.

54
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.320
Okay.

55
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.570
What we can also do.

56
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.030
We can give some space to easily do that.

57
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.000
We can say we want this test to take 100% of the container.

58
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.570
So what we can just do, we can wrap this with a size box or a container, right?

59
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.080
And this has both has a property known as height, and we can then set it to hundred percent.

60
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.920
We need to come over there.

61
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.650
Look, you can see and we can take this to the center of the container.

62
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.690
To do that, a light and use control dot and rapid center.

63
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.959
And we could also have the train come over here to give a very good format.

64
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.740
And.

65
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.550
You can see currently it's at the center and we can basically screw this way.

66
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.360
Okay.

67
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.150
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
