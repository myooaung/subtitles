00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.180
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.470
Walker In this lecture, we're going to have a background color over a test.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay?

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.640
Now, in order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our via code.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.160
And in order to have access to the caller's property, we are going to need to wrap this test button

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.690
with a container widget.

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.830
So I light and use contract dot and wrap container.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.520
And in order to have access to a lot of properties which this container has, we are going to have a

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.780
declaration and then a box declaration.

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.170
And now we can then say color and this is going to be colors, dots black 26 and the true color and

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.930
use control and has to save.

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.500
And you're going to see it over here now.

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.080
Okay.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.950
And what we can do is we can give some breathing space horizontally and vertically.

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.990
To do this, we're going to need to alight this test and use control dots.

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.330
And we're going to wrap this with a size box.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.050
The size box is similar to that of the container.

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.640
The major difference is between the size box and the container widget is the container has access to

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.450
lots more property which this size box do not have.

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.200
The container has access to the colors, the border radius, the border has the size box do not have

21
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.820
those purposes.

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.240
Okay.

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.710
Now the similar purpose is the size box of and the container is the height.

24
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.500
You can see the size box also has the height property and as well the width property for the height

25
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.030
that is the vertical shape.

26
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.470
We are going to say 40.

27
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.330
That is how long it's going to be.

28
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.740
We can just get rid of this.

29
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580
So you see this in practice, okay.

30
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.730
And you're going to see it away vertically.

31
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:10.169
And for the weeds, we can then say media query to get the screen of our weeds or the screen weeds.

32
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.979
Okay.

33
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.890
Media query, the turf contest, the size, the tweet.

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.010
And we just want to size it by 20% or we want 20% of the screen.

35
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730
To do that, all we just have to say is 0.2.

36
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.290
If we want 90%, this is going to be zero nine and 80% zero, that's eight.

37
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.070
So basically just wants 20%.

38
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.780
So zero, that's two.

39
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.950
And I use concur and save.

40
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.600
Okay, great.

41
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.510
And what we can do is.

42
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.070
Over this left side, we can have some rounded shape.

43
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.980
To do that.

44
00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.100
The container has within the box declaration, it has the border radius.

45
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.570
Okay.

46
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.740
You can see the size box.

47
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.610
Do not have this border radius or do not have the color.

48
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.330
So that is why one of the reason you would want to use a container in order to have access to lots more

49
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.960
properties if not the container and the size box are basically saying because it has the height which

50
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.530
the container has and the width which the container also has.

51
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.120
Okay.

52
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.310
So this is going to be border radius.

53
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:37.590
But every year we do not want to give for all sides, but all these specific sides and this is left.

54
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.120
So we want to give for the top left.

55
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.140
So we have to say top.

56
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.750
Left.

57
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.530
Sorry.

58
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.200
Top, left and radius.

59
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.450
Radius.

60
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.190
Dutch scholar of 25.

61
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.380
Okay.

62
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.710
How do you recommend a used controller and has to save.

63
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.860
And okay.

64
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.100
And we're also going to give a radius for the bottom left its ends.

65
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.750
Yeah.

66
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.840
So you can say bottom left radius.

67
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.290
Radius.

68
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.579
Radius.

69
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.650
That circular of 25 additional cover of Fire and youth control.

70
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.420
And that's the safe.

71
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.810
Okay.

72
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.040
Now, if you look closely, you can see this test is way to push to the left side so you can be sure

73
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.590
of it being in the center.

74
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.950
To do that, the test widgets we're going to highlight and wrap this with the center widget.

75
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.510
Alight and go check this out.

76
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.110
Okay.

77
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.600
Okay.

78
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.220
Now what we can just do.

79
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.130
We can just reduce the font size.

80
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.470
I think it's way too big.

81
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.800
We can reduce this to eight in.

82
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.190
And.

83
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.040
And that's the symbol of our time.

84
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.420
We can just copy this.

85
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.150
I light its ends.

86
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.630
Yeah.

87
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.950
Copy.

88
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.760
And.

89
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.340
We can get rid of this test button over via.

90
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.290
PS this.

91
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.140
And what we have to do.

92
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.010
We have to rename this back to order.

93
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.550
Is contraire.

94
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.720
And that's the save.

95
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.910
And.

96
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.840
And we don't really need any shape of air so we can just get rid of that border radius.

97
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.340
Border radius.

98
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.780
So it ends here.

99
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.150
You can see why truly combat is very good and we really do not need this declaration.

100
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.440
Because we basically uses the equation, you know, that to have access to lots more properties.

101
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.980
So you can just get rid of it, get rid of it and have the colour there.

102
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.480
Okay.

103
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.740
Great.

104
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.730
And what we can do is we can change the color.

105
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.000
This is going to be colors that can.

106
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:25.280
Therefore, the test is picking this color from this wire so you can just change this says colour to

107
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.940
white.

108
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.870
So over here we can then say sorry color.

109
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.820
And this is going to be colors that.

110
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.980
Why it's okay is contrary and excessive.

111
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.900
Okay.

112
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.310
We can just increase this.

113
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.480
Font size to maybe 20 or 20 to.

114
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.230
Okay.

115
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.220
22.

116
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.080
Okay.

117
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.210
And we have to do for this as well.

118
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.770
So get rid of this test button.

119
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.490
And paste is Katrina to.

120
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.680
And we're going to need to change this.

121
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.010
Back to a wish list.

122
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.180
You can try to save now and you're going to sit there.

123
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.060
But this time around, we are going to give a border at the top, right.

124
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.750
Okay.

125
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.580
So.

126
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.710
This is going to be top.

127
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.050
Top rides like that is at this spot.

128
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.290
Okay.

129
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.810
So bright and.

130
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.030
Bottom.

131
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.180
Right.

132
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.600
Okay.

133
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.970
Okay.

134
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.090
Sounds good, right?

135
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.620
Sounds good.

136
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.830
You can just change the color of your test body for it.

137
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.870
It's picking the color from this or that is the Silver Harbor.

138
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.300
You can see this as well.

139
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.110
Clickable.

140
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:57.800
Sims.

141
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.130
Good.

142
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.770
Okay, guys, see you at the next lecture.
