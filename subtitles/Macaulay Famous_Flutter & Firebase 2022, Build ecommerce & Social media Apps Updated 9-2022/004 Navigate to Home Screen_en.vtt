00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.900
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.980
In this lecture, we are going to create the loading spinner and we are going to be able to show the

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.870
user the error if there is any.

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.180
And also we will be able to log into the customer.

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.550
Homescreen Okay.

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.760
And I know that to do this we're going to need to go to the customer login screen and the first step

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.710
is to create a boolean variable, but you can see already have it over here.

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.759
So we said it's loaded and it is a type of bool.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
And the reason for this is because the value is either a true or a false.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.330
Okay, now over here we are going to need to say immediately the login user's button is clicked.

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.340
Then we want to set stage.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.960
Said State and we want to start loading.

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.410
So we're going to need to say a slowdown is equal to.

15
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.900
True.

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.640
And.

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.560
We need a semi-colon.

18
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.640
And after the account has been successfully logged in, we then want to set it again in order to update

19
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.670
the UI and it's loading.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.100
Slowdown is going to be equal to force.

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.160
We basically want to stop the load and spin this country and save.

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.190
And over here.

23
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.590
At Syncrude.

24
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.880
We have already done that because we basically copy this code, but you can see it over here.

25
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.710
So if it is loading than is equal to true, we want to return a circle circle progress indicator and

26
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.750
the colour is going to be White House.

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.290
We just want to keep on returning the test.

28
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.850
Okay, great.

29
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.030
And now you can try and save him.

30
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.470
Click on this.

31
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.290
Okay.

32
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.780
You can see the loader spinner now and it has the colour of white.

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.470
Okay.

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.320
So now what we're going to do is we're going to be able to log in to the customer home screen not to

35
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.100
do this.

36
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.920
Although there.

37
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.670
Over here.

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.560
We're going to need to store the results in a variable and the variable should be similar to that we

39
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.230
have over here.

40
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.280
That is the race OC, which is the short form of results.

41
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.850
Right.

42
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.680
So customer log is screen controller and B and over rest is equal to this.

43
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.190
And we have to specify it is a type of string because the test, the hero is a test.

44
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.580
Right.

45
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.180
Okay.

46
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.000
Great.

47
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.140
And we can then have a check so we can say if.

48
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.390
Race is not equal to success.

49
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.540
The sources we are sorry is not.

50
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.350
It's not equal to, says the sources we are basically referring to is the sources we have over here.

51
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.590
If it is not equal to sources, it means there is an there is an error, right?

52
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.230
Okay.

53
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.290
If it is not equal to success, we then want to return the snack bar.

54
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.380
Snug bar to the user.

55
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.680
The fire.

56
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.270
We have to pass in the rest.

57
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.760
And had a semicolon has it means the user has been successfully logged in.

58
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.650
We then want to return.

59
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.910
Return Navigator.

60
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.700
If we made a mistake in the cost in the London customer screen.

61
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.530
So once I return, navigate to that of contest.

62
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.540
Dot what's that push?

63
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.850
Okay for the roots.

64
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.740
This is going to be my Syria page.

65
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.750
Page roots.

66
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.270
Content and B and contests.

67
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.970
We can specify it is a type of beauty contest, which it is.

68
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.630
Okay.

69
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.610
And now we need this.

70
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.290
Okay.

71
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.750
And over here, we want to return the I think you've seen this before, right?

72
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.670
Once we return to the customer home, make sure you don't mistakenly type login, but customer home

73
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.240
screen.

74
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.870
Great.

75
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.310
Now over on the customer page or the customer screen, this is not going to work returning just the

76
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.720
customer on screen.

77
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.390
So it's only just the customer login screen.

78
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.120
It's not going to work.

79
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.180
We have to tell a floater that we want to push to the next screen.

80
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.290
So we're going to need to say navigator.

81
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.760
You can easily just copy that.

82
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.710
Navigate to.

83
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.660
Na ve so now ve he gives her.

84
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.990
That of contests.

85
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.770
So it's push we are pushing.

86
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.660
And matt, syria.

87
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.850
Page routes or routes and iPhone assets and contests.

88
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.780
Then this is going to be what's viewed contest.

89
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.220
And now we can.

90
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.940
Return.

91
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.530
The customer.

92
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.680
Customer.

93
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.910
Customer longest screen.

94
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.680
Okay.

95
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.130
So now what we're basically saying.

96
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.630
If the user had successfully created an account.

97
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.070
We then want to take the user to the customer logger screen or else if there is an error.

98
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.900
We just want to show the user the error.

99
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.190
So this is basically it.

100
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.740
And then once the user has been.

101
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.410
Navigate it to the login screen.

102
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.570
Beauvais And yeah, we're basically saying if the account has been successfully logged in.

103
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.000
And we are saying if it is not equal to success, it means that it's an error.

104
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.610
Or you can just turn this over so you can say is equal to equal to success.

105
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.360
And this should be here and this should be right.

106
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.530
Hopefully you understand this.

107
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.760
Right.

108
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.310
Okay.

109
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.040
Great.

110
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:24.490
So if it is not quite a success, we then want to show the user the error and if it is equal to success,

111
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.540
we then want to take the user to the customer or screen.

112
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.690
Okay, now use this and that is what we start.

113
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.880
And we can then try this out.

114
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.500
Come true and be.

115
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.050
Then in the customer of screen.

116
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:52.770
What we can do for now is we can return a scaffold and let's have access to lots of property scaffold.

117
00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.550
And for now we can have just a body which is going to be a center widget and.

118
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.440
The child then tests.

119
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.360
Which is just going to say on screen.

120
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.340
The newcomer is culture and save.

121
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.340
Okay.

122
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.320
And we can try this out.

123
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.800
This should be like the.

124
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.490
So Mark Paul.

125
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.940
Or you can just create an account again, like at Gmail.

126
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.530
G.M..

127
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.530
It's calm.

128
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.120
And the password is this.

129
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.690
Make sure it is correct.

130
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.220
Okay.

131
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.750
And login.

132
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.820
Okay.

133
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.960
Sounds good, right?

134
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.700
Okay.

135
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.230
You can see now we have this.

136
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.890
We can just sigh hard.

137
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.400
The coma and sti test i.

138
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.380
Font size should be 22 and font weight.

139
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.220
One size.

140
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.510
That's okay.

141
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.240
Okay.

142
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.080
Great.

143
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.370
Sounds good, right?

144
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
