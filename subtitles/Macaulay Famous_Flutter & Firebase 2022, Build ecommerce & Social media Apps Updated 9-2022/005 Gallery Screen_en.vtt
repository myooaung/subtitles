00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.780
Hi.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.760
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.180
In this lecture, we are going to create the rest of the category screen.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:17.580
But before then you can see over here what I simply did was to upload a lots of products for various

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.090
categories, not to create the screen.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.670
What we have to do is to head back to our Via Xcode and in the last lecture we created this new file

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.500
called Women Gallery.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.650
And what we can basically just do is to alight and use control and see to copy.

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.270
And in the women gallery we are going to paste this.

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.080
Okay.

11
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.270
And now we have to rename it, right.

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.510
So over a light and use control and Z to a light.

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.050
All the similar names.

14
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.600
Okay.

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.440
And now we can change this to women.

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.069
Gallery and screen.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.870
And this time around, we want to retrieve just women.

18
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.460
Close.

19
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.850
Right.

20
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.500
Okay, now, before we halt, we start this, we have to go back to the home screen and.

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.700
And.

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.970
Instead of this, we have to get rid of this and we have to call the women.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.760
Women Gallery.

24
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.690
Gallery screen.

25
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.710
Okay.

26
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.990
And over here highlights and sorry a light and use control and that's important.

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.930
It's going to take some time because I think I'm doing it for the first time now.

28
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.710
Okay.

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.080
OC imports.

30
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.750
This OC seems good.

31
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.770
And what I also did was to upload some products for the electronics.

32
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.350
So what we could just do is.

33
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.360
Over a year.

34
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.460
I'm going to change this to maybe the electronic electronics.

35
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.070
Four for the electronics category and it is of kids.

36
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.020
I'm going to change this to electronics lecture.

37
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.430
Hopefully I can spell.

38
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.510
Okay.

39
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.630
Electronics and use control needs to save.

40
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.420
And this should be electronics.

41
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.040
Now.

42
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.060
Okay.

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.350
Okay.

44
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.520
Maybe we just have to halt.

45
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.290
We start.

46
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:54.260
But before then, what we can just do is to create a new phy for the electronics and.

47
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.920
Electronics electronic underscore gallery.

48
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.490
Gallery.

49
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.340
Dot gallery on the screen.

50
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.990
Then the dots.

51
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.300
Okay.

52
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.740
And we are just going to pace this over here.

53
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.970
And I think women.

54
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.120
And okay.

55
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.460
And then I'm just going to find that products I uploaded for the electronics.

56
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.320
This is for electronics.

57
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.940
Okay.

58
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.820
And I'm just going to copy this.

59
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.190
And that's how I avoid a spelling mistake.

60
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.650
And where is equal to this electronics?

61
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.730
Right.

62
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.320
The key is control and save.

63
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:54.070
And we also have to create a new file for the shoes and shoes on the score gallery, on the score screen

64
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.690
and all the art.

65
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.540
And we have to pay this advisory.

66
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.780
Okay.

67
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.180
And a light.

68
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.630
Sorry, a light and controversy.

69
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.560
Okay.

70
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.430
Sorry.

71
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430
We did not change the name of the class.

72
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.700
We also do need to change the name, of course.

73
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.370
Okay.

74
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.170
A light and use control to a light.

75
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.090
Similar name and change it once.

76
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.520
This is going to be a lick.

77
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.020
From Nick Galloway.

78
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.970
Screen.

79
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.880
Okay.

80
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.030
For the shoes.

81
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.190
We have to pay this.

82
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.310
And we could just get rid of this command.

83
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.160
It is no longer needed.

84
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.900
Okay.

85
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.370
And this is going to be just a light and contrarian data, a light similar name.

86
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.610
Okay.

87
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.160
I like this.

88
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.210
It's trendy.

89
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.610
Okay.

90
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.420
And this is going to be shoes.

91
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.000
Gallery.

92
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.500
Then screen.

93
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.270
And this is going to be shoes.

94
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.810
Right.

95
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.540
You can try and save.

96
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.540
And you can see over here, we basically just did for the for the main gallery.

97
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.660
When we are we are only able to click men, women and electronics.

98
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.320
And recently I did shoot for shows behind the scene.

99
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.580
Right.

100
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:38.650
So what we can also do, we can also do for kids to do that, we have to head back to where we have

101
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.570
that upload via the upload screen and.

102
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.930
Over.

103
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.370
Over.

104
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.370
Okay.

105
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.800
You can see basically if the value is equal to shoes, then we want to change the subcategory listed

106
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.190
issues.

107
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.720
Right?

108
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.020
So over here we have to say elseif again.

109
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.750
I remember I said I did this behind the scene, so just should hand in electronics.

110
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.260
Right?

111
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.470
Okay.

112
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.200
I basically just added the shoes behind the scene and now we want to have kids together.

113
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.660
So this is going to be a value is equal or equal and kids.

114
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.740
It is equal for kids.

115
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.410
Then we want to change the subcategory subcategories to be equal for kids.

116
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.800
Okay, kids.

117
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.260
Okay.

118
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.390
This is basically it and you can just do it for the rest.

119
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.690
We could also do for beauty and so on.

120
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.820
You can just do for us.

121
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.340
And now what we basically just have to do is to hold restart this.

122
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.660
Okay.

123
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.560
And.

124
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.150
Sorry for the delay.

125
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.310
I think I have a very slow PC.

126
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.130
Hopefully I'll get a new one.

127
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.730
Okay.

128
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.580
Sorry.

129
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.770
Taking longer than expected.

130
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.010
And you just have to go ahead and try yours.

131
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.520
And definitely there will be no hurdles.

132
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.800
Okay, now we can try this out ourselves and it's going to hurt to start this.

133
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.430
And I'm just going to log into my store.

134
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.410
Sorry.

135
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.340
Was.

136
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.290
Few more stir.

137
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.510
So few more, sir.

138
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.240
Gmail dot com.

139
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.690
And what is.

140
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.550
B.

141
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.380
B.

142
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.030
C.

143
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.940
I'm just going to check to make sure the password is correct and log in.

144
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.380
Okay.

145
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.610
It's going to take some time to.

146
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.230
Okay.

147
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.990
Don, this is the man.

148
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:14.700
You can see we have a lot of products over here, but just the men are retrieving the wire.

149
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.300
Right.

150
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.580
And we basically have opted for product and that's good check for the women.

151
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.130
And.

152
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.300
Let's see.

153
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.330
You can see now we have four products for the women.

154
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.530
Sounds good.

155
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.940
And let's check for the electronics and you can see.

156
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.580
Okay, we also have to change this.

157
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.549
And back to the home.

158
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.820
Home and scroll down.

159
00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.430
And we have to get rid of this center.

160
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.440
And use what?

161
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.130
Use words.

162
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.730
Use words.

163
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.230
The electronics.

164
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.630
Electronics.

165
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.100
If I didn't spell this correct, you can do well to correct yours.

166
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.440
And lastly, we have to change this to say shoes.

167
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.670
She is gallery.

168
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.430
Screen and hold.

169
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.570
We start again.

170
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.890
Okay.

171
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.240
Sorry for the delay.

172
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.250
I'm just going to get in you pa for PC.

173
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.420
To make life easier for me.

174
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.690
But for now, we just have to manage.

175
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:26.520
Okay.

176
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.110
It's going to hurt.

177
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.150
We start this.

178
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.680
Okay.

179
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.250
And we have to famous store or you can just log into the customers accounts.

180
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.060
Okay.

181
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:48.840
For moisture it's Gmail dot com and the password is MSE and check to make sure the password is correct

182
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.920
and log in.

183
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.190
This is the main category and we have the women category and we also do have the electronics.

184
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.080
You can see just electronics are going to be displayed.

185
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.240
We then have the shoes and those shoes are going to be displayed.

186
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.420
