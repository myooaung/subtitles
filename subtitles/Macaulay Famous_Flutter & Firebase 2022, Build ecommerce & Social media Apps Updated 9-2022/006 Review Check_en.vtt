00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.469
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
In this lecture, we are going to continue from where we stopped.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.120
Okay?

5
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.150
After this test, we jet.

6
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
We can have a test button.

7
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.780
Test button.

8
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.870
And as you know, the test button has a property known as own press, which is a function.

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.790
And for the child, it's going to be a test widget which is going to say right with you.

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.640
Okay.

11
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.740
These are necessary.

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.150
And go check this out.

13
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.710
Okay, cool.

14
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.900
And what we can do is we do not want users to be able to see this until the product has been delivered

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.590
to them.

16
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.980
Then after the user is going to be able to write a review, right?

17
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.920
So what we can do is we can have the check by saying order.

18
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.660
Then we have a field in the database known as delivery.

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.209
Status.

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.490
If it is equal to delivered.

21
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.630
Delivered.

22
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.890
It means the product has been delivered.

23
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.460
Right.

24
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.750
And we can also add on that check and we can just say order.

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.190
And order.

26
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.680
Review is equal force.

27
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.720
It means the user has not yet dropped any review.

28
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.850
Then, Ollie.

29
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.470
We want to show this.

30
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.870
As Zoe.

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.970
We need this else.

32
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.710
We just want to display an empty to test.

33
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.060
Which is going to say.

34
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.880
It's just going to say nothing is contrary and save.

35
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.540
Okay.

36
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.870
And you're not going to see this anymore because the product is yet to be delivered.

37
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.750
And.

38
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.940
Now we can have a widget, children.

39
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.870
I think we need this.

40
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.140
And now we can.

41
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.120
Avett says, which is going to say review.

42
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.730
How did.

43
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.230
This country needs to save.

44
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.560
And also we can have.

45
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.800
An icon.

46
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.670
Which is going to be.

47
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.360
So for this.

48
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.960
This is going to be from France.

49
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.920
Always some.

50
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.140
Find some icons to check.

51
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.170
Okay.

52
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.900
He's going to try and save and go check this out.

53
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.070
Okay.

54
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.000
Click on this.

55
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.560
Okay.

56
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.290
Some school.

57
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.260
And we can also have down that check for that.

58
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.190
Well before then we can start this.

59
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.600
Test.

60
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.780
Test.

61
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.670
Star.

62
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.340
We can give this a colour of colour.

63
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.270
The sign.

64
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.510
Okay.

65
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.340
And also within the icon widget it has a property known as colour.

66
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.860
We can also say colours the sign.

67
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.320
Okay.

68
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.920
This country needs a safe.

69
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.440
Okay.

70
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.340
Some school.

71
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.520
And we cannot add on that check over.

72
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.030
We can then say.

73
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.900
Other.

74
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.070
Holder.

75
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.730
And this is also going to be delivery status.

76
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.030
They really?

77
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.380
Status.

78
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.760
Is equal to delivered.

79
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.470
If it is if it is equal to delivered, the users can then give your review.

80
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.930
Write the delivered.

81
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.660
Right.

82
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.740
And.

83
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.620
Order.

84
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.610
This is going to be under review.

85
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.060
Although review is equal to true, it means the user has dropped a review.

86
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.630
Right.

87
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.230
Okay.

88
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.990
Then we want to show this.

89
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.750
Or else we are going to have excess widgets, which is going to be empty.

90
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.720
Okay.

91
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.900
I a come here and this country needs to save and hopefully understand all this.

92
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.200
Okay.

93
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.160
Go check this out.

94
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.880
Okay.

95
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.370
You're not going to see that because the user is yet to drop a review.

96
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.160
So after the job review, look, what we can just do is we can manually change this from true, from

97
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.870
force to true.

98
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.280
You can see defaults in the database.

99
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.070
The order review is set to force.

100
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.160
That means the user is yet to give any review.

101
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.820
So what we can do is we can set this to due, which means the user as give a review.

102
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.610
Okay, now let's go check this out.

103
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.380
I think foolish.

104
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.660
Look, I'm just gonna go back.

105
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.420
And order.

106
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.890
I don't really know the products.

107
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.860
Okay.

108
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.830
And also we can change it to delivered because you can see we basically have to check.

109
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.880
We said if the delivery status is set to deliver it.

110
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.650
Remember, default delivery, the delivery status is set to preparing.

111
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.130
So we are basically saying if it is set to deliver it, that means the product has been delivered to

112
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.000
the user then only they should be able to drop a review.

113
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.050
And also we are checking also if the order review is equal to true.

114
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.590
So what we also do have to do is.

115
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.540
Delivery status.

116
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.080
We are going to change that to.

117
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.370
Delivered also.

118
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.390
Okay.

119
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.150
The word.

120
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.530
Okay.

121
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.370
Update.

122
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.550
And it means the product has been delivered and also.

123
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.630
Okay by state.

124
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.920
I think we have some spelling mistake just going to go back.

125
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.260
And come back to this again.

126
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.470
Yeah, we do have a spare era.

127
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.880
Build is delivered.

128
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.440
This new copy this.

129
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.530
And.

130
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.180
Pasted over.

131
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.770
And also.

132
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.830
Cover this country and save.

133
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.540
But states.

134
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.640
Delivery status.

135
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.910
I think we have.

136
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.160
You can begin to check this delivery status.

137
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.990
Delivery status.

138
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.740
For their review to make sure the spelling is correct.

139
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.150
Sorry.

140
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.220
I think we have it this way.

141
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.620
Check again, although review.

142
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.250
You can see is similar to her and not big letter.

143
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.490
Okay.

144
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.910
That was what we had here is this should be other review is necessary.

145
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.540
And we shall have no other heroes.

146
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.980
Okay you can see delivered and we should be saying review her that same school.

147
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.380
Okay.

148
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.400
Hopefully you understand.

149
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.690
But if you don't, you can do what's.

150
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.390
Let me know.

151
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.610
So what we can just do is we can change this back to the default preparing.

152
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:27.800
Okay.

153
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.890
Delivery status is going to be said to prepare.

154
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.179
Preparing.

155
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.220
Okay.

156
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.020
And the other review.

157
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.159
There's going to be sets to force the fort.

158
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.670
Okay.

159
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:56.540
So you can see basically we are saying before a user can write a review that products must have been

160
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.560
purchased.

161
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.030
Right.

162
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.640
And also the other review.

163
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.080
If it is equal to force, then we want to display this right with you.

164
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.260
It means the user.

165
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.300
Remember, this is basically saying the user has not yet dropped a review.

166
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.020
Right.

167
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.250
So that is what this other review is equal to force is.

168
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:26.160
So we are basically saying in order for user to write a review, the user, the product must has been

169
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.720
delivered to that user.

170
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:35.100
And also, if the user has not yet dropped any review, then we want to be able to write a review.

171
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.000
And also we have on the test which is review hard and also.

172
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.520
If the product has been delivered.

173
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:55.160
And if the order review is set to true, that is the user as dropped review then only we want to be

174
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.190
able to show this test which is review added.

175
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.890
Else we just want to show this test.

176
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:07.130
And you can see currently the user product is still preparing, right.

177
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.160
And that is the reason you currently see this empty test.

178
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.830
Right and default.

179
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.950
The order review is set to force.

180
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.150
So you can see basically the user has not dropped any reviews.

181
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.090
So that's why you're not seeing that review added.

182
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:29.370
So what you can just do is you can manually change this paper into delivered and also change the other

183
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.580
view to true in your database.

184
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.850
And you're going to see that review added just the same way you saw it.

185
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.840
