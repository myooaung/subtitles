Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.620
Now, most of the time you're going have contact areas and this area is going to cross you up, is going

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.850
to stop you from walking.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.270
Okay.

6
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.490
So now this lecture I want to show you on the how to stop such errors from crashing your app.

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.710
But radar is going to show that error in your debug console.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.210
Okay, then it doesn't stop you from crashing.

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
All you just have to do is visit this binder that's a see this.

10
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.550
You must have run.

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.960
You'll have else.

12
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.190
You're going to see something else.

13
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.380
Okay, now click on this.

14
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.680
Then you're going to see breakpoints or crosstalk or just look for a way to access this breakpoints

15
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.820
and defaults.

16
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.260
All this are going to be checked.

17
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.750
So make sure you uncheck this.

18
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.890
Okay.

19
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.210
I checked this as well.

20
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.570
Okay.

21
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.870
Now you're still going to get an error if you have any issue.

22
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.310
But this time around, it's normal across your app, but it's just going to try this error to your debug

23
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.720
console.

24
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.880
Okay, your the book also.

25
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.410
So there's no longer going to crash job.

26
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.070
Okay.

27
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.620
You can see we have this errors over here, but it has nothing to do with our app.

28
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.040
Okay?

29
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.660
Okay, guys.

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.160
See you soon.
