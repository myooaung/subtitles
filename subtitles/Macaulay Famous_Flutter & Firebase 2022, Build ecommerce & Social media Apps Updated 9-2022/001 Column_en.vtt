00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.770
Our guys work in this lecture, we're going to talk about collapse.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.600
But before then, please note everything that flutter is referred to as a widget.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.770
So we can call this the scaffold widget, the center widget and the test widget.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
Now, what we're going to be doing in this lecture is we're going to have two books.

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.710
Those two books are going to be displayed vertically.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.200
That is from top to bottom.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.300
So what we can do is we can get rid of this sensor widget in order to display widget vertically.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.450
We're going to be using the widget called column.

9
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.500
Column.

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.770
The column, widgets can take multiple widgets.

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.250
So it has this property called children.

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.910
And the first child is going to be a container.

13
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.240
And we can give this container a color.

14
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.760
We can say colors dot.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.260
That red.

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.780
Okay.

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.490
And as well, this container has a property known as weeds.

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.690
For the weeds, we can say it's going to be on red pad as well.

19
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.990
The container has a property known as hides.

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.150
The weeds has to do with how wide the container is going to be.

21
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.350
The height has to do with how long the content is going to be.

22
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.730
And for the height we can say 50 now is control and save and go check it out.

23
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.590
You're going to see the via OC.

24
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.160
So we can as well have another container.

25
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.240
Consider.

26
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.550
Okay.

27
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.470
And as you know, the container has a property known as weeds.

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.960
We can as well say it's going to be all red and hides of 50.

29
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.000
And we can say color is going to be colors that proper.

30
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.820
These come true.

31
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.660
And as.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.570
You can see it over here.

33
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.310
You can see both containers are being displayed vertically.

34
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.320
Now, what we can do is this color widget has a property known as made assets elements.

35
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.640
So we can say main as this element.

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.710
Main assist element the center.

37
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.160
So this going to take this to contain.

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.730
To the sensor, you can see.

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.750
Okay.

40
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.400
We can also have another widgets, which is going to be a test widget.

41
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.080
And this is just going to say landing page, had you truly come out in order to have a very good format

42
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.000
and use control and say.

43
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.420
You can see below.

44
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.580
Okay.

45
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.200
You can see we have three main widgets at this three minute widgets are being displayed vertically.

46
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.750
That is from top to bottom.

47
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.050
We can as well wrap this column with the padding.

48
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.480
So come true and not.

49
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.600
Okay.

50
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.140
Contour and dot wrap with padding.

51
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.740
So for all sides, we can set them.

52
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.400
So this is going to give padding to the right, left, bottom and sort like you're going to see.

53
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.930
Okay, great.

54
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:40.740
Now as well, what we can do is we can have some space between each between each widget.

55
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.980
So over this container we can have something known as sized box sized box.

56
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.620
And we are given the space vertically.

57
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.160
Right.

58
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.870
So this is going to be eight height of ten hydrogen to cover.

59
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.200
As well.

60
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.620
You can simply copy this and then paste this controller and then save.

61
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.800
And you're going to see the space.

62
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.410
Okay, great.

63
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.850
Okay, guys, see you.
