00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.710
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.180
Now heat is on here.

4
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.320
We are not going to be showing ourselves this error, but to the user.

5
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.810
Okay, so in this lecture, we're going to create a snack bar in order to display the heroes to the

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.380
user.

7
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.940
And in order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VTS code.

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.430
And in order to have a much more cleaner code, what we can do is we can create a new PHI for this.

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.580
So over this controller's directory we're going to create a new file and we're going to call this Phi

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.510
Snack underscore bar, underscore controller and then the section is dot dot and now we can use control

11
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.650
and B to make this right.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.240
Okay.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.510
Now the first step is to create a function and we're going to call this function snack bar.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.090
And what we can do is we can make this a bit more dynamic.

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.760
So over here, we're going to pass in a dynamic framework called title, and we are expecting a test.

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.180
So this is going to be a type of string.

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.010
The reason for this is because whenever we call this snack bar, we want to be able to pass the value

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.390
to this title.

19
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.980
Okay.

20
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.950
So over here, we're going to use something known as Scaffold.

21
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.140
Scaffold.

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.270
Messenger dot of contest as well.

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.610
It wants you to pass the contest over here.

24
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.110
So what we can do, we can have the drill cover and then pass the contest.

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.170
And you can see basically we don't have to specify the type, but we can just specify the type.

26
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.220
It is a type.

27
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.330
Or something known as beauty contest.

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.120
Okay.

29
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.090
And now we can say dots.

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.810
Show snack bar.

31
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.030
Okay for that snack bar is going to be.

32
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.030
Snack.

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.000
Snack bar.

34
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.340
And this is going to be a test with jets.

35
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.400
And now we can still want to display the title for the.

36
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.620
Now, this is just a variable.

37
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.610
We don't have the value to it yet.

38
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.690
Okay, the semicolon and this is basically it.

39
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.510
And now we can use control and save this file.

40
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.750
Now we can use control and B to make this smaller.

41
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.030
And then we need to head back to the London customer screen.

42
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.800
And over here where we have this function.

43
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.900
In order to check for errors.

44
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.750
Where we can store the results of this in a variable and the variable we are going to store it is going

45
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.970
to be similar to what we have over here, which is called Reds.

46
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.620
Okay.

47
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.060
So back so we can study results in a variable called race.

48
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.490
It's going to be equal to and we are expecting a test as a result of the error.

49
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.210
Right.

50
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.390
So this is to be a type of string.

51
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.960
OC is contra and beats and mixes wide.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.010
And over here, we can have some check.

53
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.530
We can just do this here.

54
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.070
Have some check so we can say if.

55
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.580
If race.

56
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.010
Is not equal to success.

57
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.470
I think we have that success in.

58
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.750
In this US controller class, you can see we have the source of a if it is not a quoted source as.

59
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.400
Then we want to return.

60
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.750
That function, which we called snack.

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.860
Snack bar.

62
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.920
And you can see it's asking us for the value.

63
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.220
So the value is going to be the rest to display the hair.

64
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.560
As.

65
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.030
LS.

66
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.680
LS ls.

67
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.080
So you are basically saying if it is not equal to sources, which means there is an error.

68
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.520
So we are going to print it.

69
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.620
We are going to show the user the error.

70
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.500
As for the now, we're just going to print.

71
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.800
You have.

72
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.370
You have navigated to the home.

73
00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.860
Full screen.

74
00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.810
Okay.

75
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.550
Okay.

76
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.470
So now what we can do is.

77
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.390
Click on this.

78
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.630
Look, you can see.

79
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.170
Please.

80
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.030
Fields must not be empty.

81
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.580
And we can study that a bit.

82
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.330
So we tell the snack bar and.

83
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.510
I think we have something known as.

84
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.050
Background colours?

85
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.320
Yes.

86
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.440
Should that be?

87
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.130
Just want to check this quickly.

88
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.570
I could program color.

89
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.640
We can say colors start.

90
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.970
C and a k.

91
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.690
His country.

92
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.380
Okay.

93
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.770
Click on this link.

94
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.110
You can see, please.

95
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.620
Fields must not be empty.

96
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920
Sounds good, right?

97
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.170
And this is a test, right?

98
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.930
So we have access to the sorry, we have assets of this type property.

99
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.050
So you can have STI test STI.

100
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.880
And we can basically increase the font size to a 18.

101
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.890
And maybe for tweets.

102
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.130
Fun.

103
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.900
Sweet.

104
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.090
Though it's maybe w 500 and is concerned try to save.

105
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.820
Click on this link you can see and we can just have the chain of command via.

106
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.070
The chain of command and control necessary in order to have a much more cleaner code.

107
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.260
You can add more style to this.

108
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.230
Click on this.

109
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.490
When it is filled in, you're not going to see this era.

110
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.890
The accounts is going to be created successfully or later in the future.

111
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.570
We are going to navigate to the home screen if no error.

112
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.340
Well, before then all we are basically saying if it is not according to sources, that means there

113
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.340
is an error and we basically want to print it out else.

114
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.310
We want to navigate to the screen because you can see basically we are storing the results in a variable

115
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.630
called race and the rest is the short form of resort.

116
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.820
And it must be same thing we have over here.

117
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.150
Or via.

118
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.660
Yeah.

119
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.990
Because first of all, we created a function called sign up users and we created the possible error.

120
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.230
And over here we had a tribe log.

121
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.450
We said, if the fields are not empty, then only we want to create an account for the user.

122
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.590
We do then only want to create an account for the user with email and the password.

123
00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.250
And as well we want to add that data to the cloud faster and we want to update this variable to say

124
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:10.800
sources and we want to print the email of the user to our debug console and as well account created.

125
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.600
So our console else is going to say please fields must not be EMC.

126
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.330
And if the hero is all that from all this, we are going to catch the error and print it to the user.

127
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.540
Probably network error or other errors such as accounts already existing.

128
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.400
We're going to print it so the user, we're going to show it to the user and over here.

129
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.070
We had created a snack bar.

130
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.280
You can see why we created the snack bar.

131
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.210
And if there's an error, we basically want to return that snack bar.

132
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.370
And you can see we are passing the rest.

133
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.680
We are passing the race over.

134
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.120
Right.

135
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.640
Else we are going to be we are going to be navigating to the home screen.

136
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.270
And you can see why we make this a bit dynamic by passing the title.

137
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.020
Right.

138
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.680
And we made it.

139
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.470
It's a string because it's going to be a test.

140
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.630
And you can see the test over here.

141
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.370
Please feel must not be M.S..

142
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.090
Okay.

143
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.340
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
