00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.620
In this lecture, we are going to talk about something known as context read and context watch, which

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.470
is a substitute to this.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:23.520
Now, what we can do is we can get rid of this and instead of this, we can use context and dothe.

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.970
Weird.

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:37.000
And as well over here, we have to specify it is a type of card provider and now we can say dots two

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.470
to.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.200
And this is a double.

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.790
So now we have to convert this to a string by saying dot to.

11
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
Or we can just say dots to string as fields.

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.630
And over here, we're going to pass into to have that additional zero different grammar.

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.620
And what we have to do is to hold restart this.

14
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.510
Archery starting.

15
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.910
All three starting.

16
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.790
But with that, he does have to wait a bit for this.

17
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.360
Okay.

18
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.840
And it's going to be hard to start this up and.

19
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.840
Log in.

20
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:37.590
And my colleague famous G.M. dot com and password so would be messy and just going to take on this to

21
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.640
be sure it is correct.

22
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.080
It is correct.

23
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.060
Okay.

24
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.810
And now let's try to hard.

25
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.240
IT products to our cards.

26
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.400
We're going to have this product and had two cards and you can see currently we have already had this

27
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.920
currently and click on this and you can see the price of the other product is $300 and you can see currently

28
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.020
we have the total price and it says $300.

29
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.060
Now click on this.

30
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.510
Okay.

31
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.410
I think we have just one item for this product.

32
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.080
So I'm going to have another product you can see.

33
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.300
One piece is available in stock so we can't order what the seller does not have.

34
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.160
We can click on this and we have eight pieces for this and how to cut.

35
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.060
Okay.

36
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.420
And currently you can see it got updated over here.

37
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.990
And this is where the problem is.

38
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.940
Click on this increment.

39
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.120
You can see we incremented the quantity to two.

40
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.560
But the.

41
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.700
The two surprise serial males.

42
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.190
7.9.

43
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.030
I'm just going to click on this again.

44
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.530
Look, you can see we incremented the quantity to three.

45
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.540
That is, we need three of this particular product, but yet the price still remains and seven, nine,

46
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.990
nine.

47
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.720
And the reason for this is because we said contest that read.

48
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.790
So we are only able to read data.

49
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.920
We are not going to be able to update or write data, right?

50
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.760
So instead of read, we are then going to talk about something known as contest dot wash.

51
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:37.610
So get rid of this read and we are going to say contest that watch and get rid of this parenthesis.

52
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.150
Okay.

53
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.920
And how to start this now.

54
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.920
Okay.

55
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.810
I'm basically showing you this in case you see it in other tutorials or any other place is is basically

56
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.430
the same as the provider of contests and so on.

57
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.660
On.

58
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.140
And my colleague.

59
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.520
That you made to come and.

60
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.840
Slogan.

61
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.690
Okay.

62
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.450
And.

63
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.970
We can try this out now and click on this.

64
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.800
Add to cart and go check it out.

65
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.480
And now click on this.

66
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.020
You can see.

67
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.350
It got updated every time.

68
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.980
And the reason for this is because we're using this watch.

69
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.400
And what this would basically do is to watch for any updates.

70
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.750
We are doing okay.

71
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.320
As the name implies and I think we have just to pieces for this item.

72
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.350
We're just going to try with this.

73
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.930
And we have eight pieces for this item.

74
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.350
And you can see click on this.

75
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.090
You can see is watching for the updates we are making and it is updating it real time.

76
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.710
Okay.

77
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.980
And instead of using this watch, this is too similar.

78
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.170
Get rid of this and I'm going to show you this now and provider.

79
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.010
That contest.

80
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.590
Dot.

81
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.860
So we also do have to specify it's a type of word card provider.

82
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.970
And the shorter price and we have to convert this to.

83
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.830
To string as fixed and for the fraction of it to and hardest.

84
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.630
Okay.

85
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.790
And you can see this as this type contest.

86
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.500
Contest.

87
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.110
I'm just going to commit this.

88
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.990
Comment and.

89
00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.860
Contest.

90
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.570
Contest dots what the tweet.

91
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.490
And.

92
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.670
Okay.

93
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.120
Card provider.

94
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.040
That's the total price.

95
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.300
Dot dot.

96
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.740
So string as fixed.

97
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.370
Okay.

98
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.180
Into.

99
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.000
You can see both us same.

100
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.380
Right.

101
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.000
Okay.

102
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.550
Then you can see this again.

103
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.110
We're going to comment this out again.

104
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.370
Well, I'm just going to.

105
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.290
Okay.

106
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.220
I'm just going to copy this.

107
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.010
And -- and I'm going to commit this.

108
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.310
And watch.

109
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.120
Okay.

110
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.180
Get rid of this and I'm going to copy this.

111
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.360
And his this year.

112
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.500
And I'm going to commit this and we turn this contest.

113
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.840
Within the context.

114
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.960
Yes, we can then say Liston is equal to ture.

115
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.450
Okay.

116
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.830
This.

117
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.500
Is this over here.

118
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.050
And this over here is same thing.

119
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.570
Right.

120
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.850
And this over here.

121
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.310
And this over here.

122
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.960
The same.

123
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.740
Right.

124
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.360
Okay.

125
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.600
In order for us to update the data every time we are using the watch.

126
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.200
Right.

127
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:42.200
We are using the DOD watch in order to listen for data and update it in real time.

128
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.490
In order for us not to update data real time, we are then going to use the real.

129
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.000
Right.

130
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.560
Okay.

131
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.120
Same thing for the provider, that of Cortez, if you want to update it every time you have to pass

132
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.830
the listing, as the name implies, it's going to listing for data, right?

133
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.660
And you have to set it to true.

134
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.760
Else if you don't want to listen to data, you have to set this to force.

135
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.690
Right.

136
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:19.400
So it's going to be the same thing with what we have over here.

137
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.170
Okay.

138
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.190
And currently, you can see.

139
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.300
This is what we have.

140
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.270
Just this.

141
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:29.640
Okay.

142
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.660
What are we missing?

143
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.920
Get rid of this.

144
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.990
And you can see correctly, this is what we have.

145
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.760
So this is equivalent to the contest not revealed.

146
00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.720
And you can see correctly, we are not passing the list then.

147
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.190
And that is because we are within the test.

148
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.000
We jets.

149
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.210
And since we are within the test, we judge it is automatically going to set it to true.

150
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.970
So we have something similar.

151
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.330
We have something like this behind the scene.

152
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:01.810
Right.

153
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.980
So this is basically the same.

154
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.650
This is basically the same thing as the contest that watch.

155
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.080
Right.

156
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.930
But if we are not within the test within a widget, you can see this is a widget.

157
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.280
We are within a widget.

158
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.000
Right.

159
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.270
But if we are not within a widget, we then have to specify as we want to do it over within this function.

160
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.500
Right.

161
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:35.200
We must then specify the list, then we must either turn it to we must turn it to false and not true

162
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.240
because we are outside the we are outside a widget.

163
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.660
Right.

164
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.550
And hopefully understand.

165
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.540
But what you just have to take in for this lecture is.

166
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.020
The substitute.

167
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.750
For this.

168
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.870
Is the contest, though, to watch in that sort of data the real time you know that's update the data

169
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:06.380
are real time and the substitute for this.

170
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.560
For this f four.

171
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.420
This is the opposite of what the contest dealt with.

172
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.080
Okay.

173
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:24.550
Now, let's just say since we have settled to force and see what's going to happen, we just have to

174
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.680
try to learn more of all this.

175
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.310
Okay.

176
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.670
And click on this.

177
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.730
I'm just going to start this.

178
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.920
They can and.

179
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.270
You can see the set list and it's going to be equal to force.

180
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.740
And hopefully we have.

181
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.180
No errors and open to minor.

182
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.070
Okay.

183
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.700
Thus when.

184
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.790
Log in and.

185
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.830
My colleague.

186
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.690
Give me all that.

187
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.260
Come.

188
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.270
The MSI Click Login.

189
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.420
Okay.

190
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.750
And let's try to have a product to our cloth.

191
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.800
This click on the hard.

192
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.360
Okay.

193
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.290
How did.

194
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.780
And in comment you can see it is not incremented.

195
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.250
Right click on it again.

196
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.700
You can see it is not incrementing.

197
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:50.590
We are updating the quantity over here but we are not incrementing the total price and that is because

198
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.920
we set listing to say force.

199
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.120
That is, we do not want to list in for any data.

200
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.850
Right.

201
00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.330
Okay.

202
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.600
So this is equivalent to the contest that we are holding.

203
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.140
Won't be we only want to be able to read data.

204
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.570
We don't want to be able to update that data.

205
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.350
Right.

206
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.840
And then the.

207
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.900
The list and equal to true is same thing as the.

208
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.980
The same thing as the.

209
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.400
Contest.

210
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.750
Watch.

211
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:33.050
And like I said default since we are within the widgets, you can see currently we are within the test

212
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.530
with that.

213
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.130
Right.

214
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:40.970
So we really do not need to pass in this list and because default is going to automatically pass this

215
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:48.110
list in for us or we can just pass it to make it more clear and auto start this again to see.

216
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.690
Hopefully we have no errors.

217
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.930
It's hard to start this and we are just going to try this and I'm going to let you go.

218
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.090
Okay.

219
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.570
Okay.

220
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.180
It's going to hard to start this up now and.

221
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:12.280
Sign up and log in.

222
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.250
My colleague, Ms..

223
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.050
G.M. dot com.

224
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.760
And the password.

225
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.300
Is being g-a-y messy and I'm going to click on log in.

226
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.020
Okay.

227
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:43.190
This and the cards can see it has been updated and click on this and you can see in as expected because

228
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.580
we are listing for the updates.

229
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.570
Okay.

230
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.070
And anyone you think it's more easier for you, you can go with that.

231
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.350
You can either go with the contest or to watch.

232
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.900
In order to update your data real time.

233
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:05.910
Or you can either go with the provider of contests and maybe you can pass in the list and to true anyone.

234
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:12.180
You think it's more convenient or more understandable to you, you can go with it.

235
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.210
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
