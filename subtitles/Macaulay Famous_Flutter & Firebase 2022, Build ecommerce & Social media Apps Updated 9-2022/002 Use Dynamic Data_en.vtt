00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.290
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.350
Welcome.

3
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.030
In this lecture, we are going to make our data dynamic, okay?

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.040
To do this, we have to create a list of tests, write a list of tests we get, and we are going to

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.840
do it at the top over here.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.510
And we can just go ahead and specify it is a type of list.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.180
And also we are expecting a test, right?

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:37.610
So it is a type of string and now we can call this title and it's going to be equal to a list of tests.

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.180
Right.

10
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.750
Okay.

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.810
Now the first test is going to say.

12
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.740
Mr..

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.740
Meister had to turn a corner.

14
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.620
The second test is going to say, how does.

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.320
And the TED test is going to say a date profile.

16
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.910
The fourth test is going to say manage and manage.

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.690
My teenage.

18
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.800
And hopefully I can spell that my niche products.

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.240
Okay.

20
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.580
We have one, two, three, four.

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.230
And sorry.

22
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.160
Sorry.

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.110
And the fifth test is going to say maybe balance.

24
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.060
The balance.

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.460
And lastly.

26
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.580
This is going to be for the stats tea star status.

27
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.290
Okay, great.

28
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.580
And over here we need a semicolon and we can just use a state.

29
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.900
A state for widget since the data are dynamic.

30
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.480
So why light and use confined dots then convert to stateful with that?

31
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.730
Okay, great.

32
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.420
And now instead of this.

33
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.680
You can get rid of this and the tie to the tie to variable.

34
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.250
And we're going to need to pass the index over.

35
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.009
Remember, the index is referring to each item we have in this list.

36
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.880
Right.

37
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.560
And also what we can do is within the test, the test has a property known as to.

38
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.880
Ballpark is okay, is control, and that's safe now and go check it out.

39
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.770
You're going to see the wire.

40
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.760
You're going to see.

41
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.140
You can see the changes.

42
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:41.910
And what we can just do is we can reduce the main axis spacing to 30 and cross us 15 to 30 as well.

43
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.230
And we can just get rid of this pad.

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.570
And with that we have a light and use control dots and remove this widgets.

45
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.400
It's control as save.

46
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.440
And go check it out.

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.350
Okay.

48
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.610
I don't I don't I think I don't like this going to the next line.

49
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.140
We could just get rid of this case and use a small litter use, control and save.

50
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.000
Okay.

51
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.840
Do the same thing and manage product.

52
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:29.080
Then I'm going, okay, I'm just going to reduce this to maybe 20 or it's end and say first.

53
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.260
I was going to look like and.

54
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.600
Okay.

55
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.920
I think this is okay.

56
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.370
And now I'm going to change the color of the test.

57
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.260
Over your shoulder.

58
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.350
Maybe colors that white.

59
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.280
You can just use your own color and your size.

60
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.720
Okay.

61
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.730
And now we can make the icon dynamic as well.

62
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.980
To do that, we have to create a dynamic variable.

63
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.850
Right.

64
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:10.190
So this is also going to be a type of list that is list of icons and it is a type of icon data or something

65
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.110
known as icon data.

66
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.320
And we're going to call this variable icon like is going to be called to a list of icons.

67
00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.279
Okay.

68
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.120
The first icon is going to be icon.

69
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.620
Icons Dot store.

70
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.840
Okay.

71
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.460
The second icon is going to be okay.

72
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.540
This is for.

73
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.210
Orders.

74
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.810
Okay.

75
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.810
We can just use the icons that.

76
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.610
Shop.

77
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.120
Shop.

78
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.970
On the score.

79
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.470
Maybe, too.

80
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.590
I think we have icons of that sorry shop.

81
00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:00.550
On this quote to outline okay is going to serve as the order orders and icons.

82
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.920
Though it's added for the added profile.

83
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.630
It did.

84
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.320
Okay.

85
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.450
The fourth icon is going to be icons.

86
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:24.530
I think icons the settings for the manage product settings and for the balance we can use icons.

87
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.520
That I think attach attach on the score.

88
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.720
Attached, underscore money and see.

89
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.280
Okay.

90
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.240
And the last icon, we want to be icons.

91
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.550
That.

92
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.840
Show.

93
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.280
On the scorecards or charts.

94
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.850
Sorry.

95
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.890
Okay.

96
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.050
Is excessive.

97
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.510
Okay.

98
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.790
And over here, we need a semicolon.

99
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.660
Okay.

100
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.250
Hopefully we have the.

101
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.090
My store.

102
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.810
My store.

103
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.610
My shopping for orders.

104
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.080
It did provide.

105
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.950
One, two, two, four, five, six.

106
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.870
One, two, three, four, five, six.

107
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.030
Okay.

108
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.070
This country needs to save and now we can then use it.

109
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:28.090
Instead of this we can get rid of this and core the icons variable and we want to assess each icon in

110
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.570
that list by the index that is zero one, two, two, four, five, six, seven, eight and so on.

111
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.010
Okay.

112
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.970
Since good.

113
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.550
Since.

114
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.260
Good sense.

115
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.650
Good.

116
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.170
Or maybe we could also have a pardon.

117
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:46.560
Pardon.

118
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.630
And this time around, you're just going to go with the default eight.

119
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.850
You can check it out.

120
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.420
Looking great, right?

121
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.130
And you can see we have this elevation.

122
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.860
If you don't like that, most of the time, you just have to go with your own style.

123
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.200
You don't have to go with mine.

124
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.190
So you could maybe get rid of the default.

125
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.490
Okay.

126
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.990
Sorry.

127
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.930
We within the cards, we have this elevation and we said it's going to be 15, but you can just get

128
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.880
rid of this or use zero and you're not going to see that lets you shadow.

129
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.390
We have you can see it's gone.

130
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.290
I think I love it.

131
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.730
So I'm just going to.

132
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.610
Okay.

133
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.590
I'm just gonna do this and I think 15 is okay and use control properly.

134
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.610
You can just use 50, 60 or any you want.

135
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.850
You don't really need to follow my own pattern of design.

136
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.510
Okay.

137
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.650
Sounds good.

138
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.590
Since.

139
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.400
Good.

140
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.730
Since.

141
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.540
Good.

142
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.240
Sounds good, right?

143
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.080
Okay.

144
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.980
Okay, guys.

145
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.780
See you in the next lecture.
