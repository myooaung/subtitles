00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.250
In this lecture, regular creates the comic books.

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.380
Okay, now, first of all, what we can do is you can see currently this comment is endless.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.980
Okay.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.900
And what we can do is can specify how many comment we need to do this.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.550
We need to go back to our code and then to the list view that view there.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.270
Then this view the view that has a property known as item count.

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.830
And for the now we can just say we need six comments.

10
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.690
Okay.

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.830
Yes.

12
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.270
Country and save and.

13
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.710
Okay.

14
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.409
Over here.

15
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.470
We're going to have just Cece comments you're going to see shortly.

16
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.500
Okay.

17
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.160
You can see now we have one, two, two, four, five, six.

18
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.570
Okay.

19
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.640
Now, what are we going to do in this?

20
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.540
This are going to be the comment box.

21
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.980
Okay.

22
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.040
Now, to do this, you can see over here, we're basically using the live star in a that's a loop over

23
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.460
each item which use that are going to be coming to the right.

24
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.310
And we basically want to display them.

25
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.090
And over here we are using the expanded widgets now, therefore this to take the available space.

26
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.510
Okay.

27
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.180
And then that's a hard that's come works.

28
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.300
We need to come out from the list view to do that right.

29
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.870
And as well the expanded widgets and over here you can then hard to cover okay now the first widgets

30
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.390
are going to be isn't is something known as divider.

31
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.410
Okay?

32
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.890
We're basically using this divider in order to have a line that is separate all this and.

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.350
The next widgets we're going to be using.

34
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.230
I can't use country and save.

35
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.020
And okay, probably, you know, going to see this.

36
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.280
Okay.

37
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.660
Now, all we can do is this divider has a property known as color.

38
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.030
And you can see colors that gray.

39
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.430
Okay.

40
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.130
And.

41
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.830
We can add cover and as well, the divider has a property known as thickness, which is similar to the

42
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.640
width property.

43
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.400
And we can see we want one either to cover and use contra and that's to save.

44
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.750
Okay.

45
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.840
You win.

46
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.860
See the way now.

47
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.460
Okay.

48
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.870
And now we're going to need to create the comment box.

49
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.690
To do this, we are going to be using the least II widget this time.

50
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.440
And as you know, the list that has the leading property, which is going to be at the left and the

51
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.360
title property, which is going to be at the middle and the trailing property which is going to be on

52
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.060
the right side.

53
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.420
Okay.

54
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.120
Now, what we need to use now is the tie to and for the title.

55
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.050
It is going to be a test for field, which is similar to the test field.

56
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.790
Okay.

57
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.950
And now we can have a decoration and a box decoration.

58
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.910
Okay.

59
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.150
So in other words, the corruption but impedes.

60
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.330
The Christian.

61
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.430
Okay.

62
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.840
Great.

63
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.590
And now we can have a level test.

64
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.350
Which is going to say comment okay Ajit to cover and use cloture and as to save.

65
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.480
And you're going to see it over there.

66
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.530
Okay.

67
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.760
You can see now, we basically don't need this.

68
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.910
Just get rid of this.

69
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.100
I was just trying to show you.

70
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.950
Okay.

71
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.510
Okay.

72
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.070
Okay.

73
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.170
And now we can as well have the liberal arts tie.

74
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.240
That is tie this we just have.

75
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.150
And this would be test tie.

76
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.340
Okay.

77
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:57.460
We can say font size to 19 or 18, 18 is okay and we can as we'll give you a call or two, I think,

78
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.970
call us the white.

79
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.940
Okay.

80
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.060
We can also specify the fonts which gets the fonts weeds.

81
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.840
Funds, which we don't want to be that broad because can a 500 and how do you cover use culture and

82
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.500
obsessive.

83
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.580
Okay.

84
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.589
You're going to sit now.

85
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.829
Okay.

86
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.910
Great.

87
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.730
And what we can do is over a year we then need to send button.

88
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.720
Okay.

89
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.380
You can just ideas more here, which we can.

90
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.400
How did you convert?

91
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.390
Okay.

92
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.380
And this is for the test for field.

93
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.370
Right.

94
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.150
Okay.

95
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.560
Now, we need to come out from AIDS and then have the trailer.

96
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.190
And the trailer is going to be.

97
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.690
It is going to be a test.

98
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.850
Test, but it.

99
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.140
Okay.

100
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.330
You can see it has the child property.

101
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.190
The child property is going to be accessed widgets and this is going to cease and.

102
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.390
Look at the and as well.

103
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.700
It is your press property.

104
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.440
You can see now that has gone.

105
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.000
Okay.

106
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.160
And now we can use control and ask to see if you're going to sit at the right side.

107
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.310
Okay.

108
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.910
You can see the way we can as well as try this.

109
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.020
You can see it.

110
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.670
Test tie.

111
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.550
Says Try and color his movie colors.

112
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.080
Dark white.

113
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.390
Okay.

114
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.960
But the test is going to be white.

115
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.910
Okay, great.

116
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.270
Now, all we need to do next is when we click on this.

117
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.030
We don't want this caller to do that.

118
00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:02.370
The test, the AP decryption has something known as for course, for cross border.

119
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.350
And it's going to be outline.

120
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.310
Hotline.

121
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.400
Hotline, the.

122
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.470
And you can ask me for the border side or the border side.

123
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.700
Going to be border.

124
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.180
Side as well.

125
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.640
We can easily just get rid of it and we can get rid of it.

126
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.220
You just have to say put aside the that's.

127
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.480
That?

128
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.000
No.

129
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.950
Okay.

130
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.430
I did see the coma and.

131
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.390
Okay.

132
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.270
Okay.

133
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.690
Now you can see is not visible because you can't see anything again.

134
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.990
Now I said, Oh, this, we can have the other side and we just want to change the colour to call us

135
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.310
dark red.

136
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.950
Okay.

137
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.630
How did you come to in this country?

138
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.730
And has to save.

139
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.580
Okay.

140
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.710
Okay.

141
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.360
You can see when whenever you click on this.

142
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.370
Okay.

143
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.180
You just had a digital camera.

144
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.280
Okay.

145
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.850
Probably we don't need.

146
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.670
A border.

147
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.120
You can just see, but.

148
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.950
But aside.

149
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.040
What a side that.

150
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.640
No.

151
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.540
And.

152
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.660
Addition of power.

153
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.960
Okay.

154
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.700
Now, Jeter's home field as well has the border.

155
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.780
Okay.

156
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.910
So it's in the empty declaration, right?

157
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.480
Okay.

158
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.640
The border.

159
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.020
And it's going to be hot line.

160
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.840
At in the.

161
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.640
Okay.

162
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.320
Is NSC Digital Core.

163
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.660
Okay.

164
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.260
I think this is okay.

165
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.750
Yeah.

166
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.210
Is a are of the K and then you can click on send.

167
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:25.600
Okay.

168
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:33.460
Now lastly, you know that to get the input of the user, we need to had something known as test editing

169
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.120
controller.

170
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:40.780
So over here we can't create a final variable and we can call this, we can just go to the specify the

171
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.140
type.

172
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.400
It is a type of test and it's controller and you can call this variable comment.

173
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.540
Controller is required to test lower making this.

174
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.720
We are using the underscore in the notes and make this variable private.

175
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.790
So we are not going to be able to be affected this way.

176
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.020
But our side is fine.

177
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.210
I'm just going to do this again.

178
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.000
Quickly, test that it's in controller.

179
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.570
Test it.

180
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.200
It's in control.

181
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.830
Okay.

182
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:08.730
Okay.

183
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.590
