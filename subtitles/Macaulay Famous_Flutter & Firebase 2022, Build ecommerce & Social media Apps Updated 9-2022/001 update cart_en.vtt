00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.530
Hi.

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.170
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.510
Now, why are these clicks on any of this products?

4
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.200
Then they should be able to add this product to their cards.

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.340
Okay.

6
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.360
Now, to do this, they're going to need to go back to our visa code.

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.740
Okay.

8
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.930
And then we're going to go to the provider, their tree, and then the cards on the score.

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.910
Provider Fi.

10
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.330
Okay.

11
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
And now we can use control and be, you know, that to make this wide.

12
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.310
Okay.

13
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
Now, the first step that needs to take is we are going to create a method or a function.

14
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.910
Okay.

15
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.530
So over here, we're going to create a method and we can call this odd.

16
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.280
Products to cuts.

17
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.770
Okay.

18
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.180
Now the users are going to be building this products based on either the.

19
00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.330
Product ID or the product price or the product's name or even the product's imagery.

20
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.060
Okay, so what is practice is gonna need to pass in all those fields.

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.620
We want the user to be able to use that so hard that products so they are costs.

22
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.500
Okay, so first of all, they're going to pass the product ID.

23
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.100
Okay, now we can specify the type of data.

24
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.440
It is a type of string.

25
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.980
Okay.

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.690
And hide your true coma and uses can also hearts.

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.010
Based on the price of the product.

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.890
We can also specify the type of data.

29
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.140
It is a type of double.

30
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.310
Okay.

31
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.520
As well.

32
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.670
Users can hide items in their carts based on the product's name, as though it can specify the type

33
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.240
of data.

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.460
It is a type of string and.

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.980
Is this Canada so hot?

36
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.180
Based on the image, you are real.

37
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.080
But you can also specify the type of data.

38
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640
It is a type of string.

39
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.060
Okay, now this is dynamic.

40
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.500
This are dynamic variables, right?

41
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.000
So whenever I would call this function called hot products of cats, we are going to passing all this

42
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.960
values.

43
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.780
Or pass on the values to all those variables.

44
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.100
Okay.

45
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.620
Great.

46
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.090
Now, the first step Rwanda need to take is, first of all, regular first check, if that's products

47
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.240
as already be handed by that user.

48
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.340
That's if the user already has that product in his or her cots.

49
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.730
Okay.

50
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.920
So to do that, we are going to have had if statement where.

51
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.440
Okay.

52
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.980
So we're going to call this variable, which has access to all our cots.

53
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.210
Data.

54
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.760
Right.

55
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.140
Okay.

56
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.530
Tarsus has to decide the tie to the quantity, the prize, the image URL.

57
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.980
Okay.

58
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.830
Okay.

59
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.900
If you do understand this, you can go back to the lecture where we created all this.

60
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.800
I know you might have forgotten how we did all this.

61
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.240
So you can easily just refer to this and come back again over here so you understand how it works.

62
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.550
Okay?

63
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.280
So we're going to give a check.

64
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.630
On and we like it.

65
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.840
We can call that this way.

66
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.260
Boycott on the score card items.

67
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.130
Okay.

68
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.810
Now to check if these are already out there that I tend to.

69
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.410
Yeah.

70
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.430
Cats we have something known as the contains key.

71
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.750
Okay, so we're just gonna pass the product ID.

72
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.050
Okay.

73
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.070
Products 80.

74
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.690
Okay.

75
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.440
Great.

76
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.620
Right now, if the user has already had that product to their cards, that means we don't want to have

77
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.500
that product again.

78
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.870
Right.

79
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.579
We just want to update the products.

80
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.020
If it was one product, these are how that before we kind of did that same product to maybe to quantity,

81
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.040
that's less we want or that's the same ones or the same products, but we need to of that products.

82
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.370
Okay.

83
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.970
So to do that or we just have to see is to call this variable gear that has access to all our cots data.

84
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.290
Right.

85
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.050
So you can see account items, dots of dates.

86
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.830
Okay.

87
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.610
Now you can see is asking for the key.

88
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.270
The key is going to be the products.

89
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.220
The product ID and.

90
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.170
We can change its value to something else we can change is to continue to exist in.

91
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.880
As it stands.

92
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.220
Still existing cards by ten.

93
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.840
Okay.

94
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.210
Now we can get rid of this function and use this.

95
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.480
You know, that's a break down to the next line and just had your.

96
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.590
This.

97
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.810
Great.

98
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.790
Now we can of this Dutch product.

99
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.400
So what we can do is to say it.

100
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.250
It is going to be.

101
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.200
Is this team.

102
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.480
So.

103
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.070
We need to call the attributes first.

104
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.470
You can just using our function.

105
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.810
Okay.

106
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.840
Going to be cuts.

107
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.860
Attributes rights.

108
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.540
Okay.

109
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.050
Now you can see who's asking for the ID.

110
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.540
We can just get rid of all this.

111
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:13.380
So back to the nest, but not to have a very good start and as a very nice understanding.

112
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.840
Okay.

113
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.060
Get rid of this.

114
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.990
The mother, Archibald is referring to the courts model.

115
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.340
Okay.

116
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.700
Right.

117
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.080
Okay.

118
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.610
So now we can pass the I.D. idea.

119
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.870
Okay.

120
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.030
You can pass the I.D..

121
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.410
The Heidi is going to be is is ten.

122
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.440
That is of value.

123
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.770
Is this thing called a standard I.D.?

124
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.120
Okay.

125
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.510
Then as well.

126
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.160
We need to pass the tie to.

127
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.140
The title is going to be as this ten.

128
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.430
Is it still cards I tend to tie to?

129
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.500
As for.

130
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.500
The prize.

131
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.990
Assistant.

132
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.380
But at that price.

133
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.430
Sorry.

134
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.180
And as for the quantity.

135
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.440
Now since the product was already we had it.

136
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.090
All we just have to say is as a SIM card, as a standard.

137
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.730
Cuts.

138
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.630
At the.

139
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.990
Or to see.

140
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.050
So.

141
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.280
As assistant.

142
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.200
Courts say.

143
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.960
That's quantity ten plus one.

144
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.390
Okay.

145
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.600
We just want so hard.

146
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.800
Want to.

147
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.710
Is this ten.

148
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.570
That is it is it is is that right?

149
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.860
So we want to hardwire to its okay.

150
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:12.310
I think lastly we have the images as well and I can see that arrow is gone is going to be resistant

151
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:12.670
card.

152
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:13.640
I don't.

153
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.670
He material.

154
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.990
Okay, great.

155
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.370
This basically it.

156
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.980
Now we can use control and save.

157
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.350
Okay.

158
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.270
So what you're basically saying is.

159
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.679
First of all, we created a function called hot product two cots.

160
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.860
You can call this a function or you can refer to as a made site.

161
00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:36.220
Okay.

162
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:45.290
And in order for users to be able to had products, the accords we passed and the product ID we passed

163
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:52.370
in, the product price we passed in the product's name, that is the title and the product's image will

164
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.170
be product ID.

165
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.920
The product's price is different to other products.

166
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.570
So be able to with all this, are going to be able to grab the products, right?

167
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.920
Okay.

168
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:11.750
Then before we had the products of the cots, we are first of all checking if that product was ready.

169
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.150
We had added by the user to their cots.

170
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.420
So that's why we created this.

171
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.700
You with a way to say if.

172
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.890
The high term.

173
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.540
As being the heritage added to the accounts and internet of Check.

174
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.370
We are using the products ID.

175
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.240
Right.

176
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:31.560
Okay.

177
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.880
The buy the product idea is just the same as the products.

178
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.110
The product's name.

179
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.410
Right.

180
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.770
Okay.

181
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.920
So we are checking if that product has already be added.

182
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.350
Then we don't need to rehash that.

183
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.600
I turned to the cart again.

184
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.890
All we just have to do is to update that product's rice.

185
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:55.910
So we updating the product's quantity by saying plus equal want rights plus one rights.

186
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.220
Okay.

187
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.440
So that's basically it.

188
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.030
So in in this lecture, I will not have that products to the courts.

189
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.760
What we are simply just doing is objects in the courts.

190
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.160
Right.

191
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:07.500
Okay.

192
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.760
Okay, guys.

193
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.900
