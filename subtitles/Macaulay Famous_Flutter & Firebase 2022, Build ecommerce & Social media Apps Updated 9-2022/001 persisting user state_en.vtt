00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.760
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.510
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.100
Now, when the user first visit our application, the first page that you see should be the log in screen.

4
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:08.570
Okay.

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.480
Now, I know that to do this, we're going to need to go to the main door.

6
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.140
That's five.

7
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.950
And this is of this button.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.740
Ava, we are going to change this to the login screen.

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.060
Okay.

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.410
I think we need cheese.

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.780
Okay.

12
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.450
To import this and I'll also start this.

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.640
This is going to take us back to the logging screen.

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.080
Okay.

15
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.430
Okay.

16
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.790
Okay.

17
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.240
Okay.

18
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.780
Okay.

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.400
Okay.

20
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.370
Now let's check it out.

21
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.640
Is going to take us back to the luggage school, right?

22
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.010
Okay.

23
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.490
Okay.

24
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.440
Not you for any reason.

25
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.980
You don't have an so you can, is it?

26
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.600
It just creates one layer.

27
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.610
But I think I do have an account.

28
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.970
So we'll just sign in with our accounts and you can have an account.

29
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.940
Or a test user at Gmail that's calm and.

30
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.170
The password is a Y and a C.

31
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.540
Okay.

32
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.490
Click on the log in.

33
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.630
Okay.

34
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.220
This is going to take us now to the home screen.

35
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.630
Okay.

36
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.930
But the issue is, if we should restart also status, it's going to take us back to the login screen.

37
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.330
And that's means a user needs to log in all the time whenever they want to use this app.

38
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.720
Right.

39
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.430
And which I think is going to be a very bad design, which is going to take us back to the log in screen.

40
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.130
I know that's easy.

41
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.020
So I figured we need to log in.

42
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.270
Right.

43
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.650
Okay.

44
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.430
Now, what we're going to do is when a user first log, the log, when these are first log in, we're

45
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.020
going to see that user section so they don't have to log in all the time again.

46
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.410
Okay.

47
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.550
When they get to do this, they're gonna need to go to the main that that's fine.

48
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.090
And now we can then use click through and be in order to make this right.

49
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.710
Okay, nice.

50
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.230
Out of this log in screen, we're going to get rid of this for now and only something.

51
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.280
Nord Stream.

52
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.020
View the.

53
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.780
Okay.

54
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.610
Street view there.

55
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.100
Okay.

56
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.590
Is going to take into view the right.

57
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.920
Okay.

58
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.020
There's going to be contests.

59
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.720
And Canada, comma and.

60
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.730
Passes something known as SNAP.

61
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.110
Shuts.

62
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.730
You can just call this user Snapchat's user.

63
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.330
Snapchat.

64
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.290
You can see this user snapshot as the variable which has access to our data in the Firebase OC.

65
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.520
Now they're going to use this function.

66
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.440
And OC nasal distributor has something on us stream.

67
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.360
Okay, well, this trend is going to be Firebase Horse.

68
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.940
Dot EastEnders then dot all states changes.

69
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.270
This is going to check if we are either logged in or not.

70
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.720
Okay.

71
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.750
Now over here, we're going to do some if announced statements or you're going to say if.

72
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.940
User snap.

73
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.900
Snapshot Dodd's condition state is equal to.

74
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.880
Connection.

75
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.710
On neck shows take note within that is it is trying to fetch that data right.

76
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.000
So what I just will do is to be told a sense how widgets.

77
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.710
Since our jet.

78
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.950
And the child of the sense how we get is going to be a secular of progress.

79
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.830
Secular.

80
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.210
Progress.

81
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.390
Okay.

82
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.290
Circle.

83
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.640
Circle our progress indicator to show to the user that it is currently loaded.

84
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.060
Okay.

85
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.760
Now if.

86
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.680
Okay.

87
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.500
They're going to say if user snapshots starts.

88
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.720
Coalition states.

89
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.589
Is equal to.

90
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.230
Clinician.

91
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.460
States.

92
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.770
Condition status active.

93
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.610
Okay.

94
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.100
We are then going to do an initial check.

95
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.160
We are going to see if use a.

96
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.660
Snapshot again.

97
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.310
Dots has data, that is if the user is currently logged in.

98
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.470
Okay.

99
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.870
I'm going to get rid of this for us.

100
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.490
There's no harm to this, okay?

101
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.150
If the user is granted all the rights, then.

102
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.600
All we just have to say.

103
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.800
All you have to do is to take the user.

104
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.400
So you can see we can.

105
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.750
But.

106
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.840
What?

107
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.640
Tom now.

108
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.080
Okay.

109
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.940
Then else.

110
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.810
Else.

111
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.180
Right.

112
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.340
Okay, return.

113
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.800
Retired.

114
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.290
They're going to return the user to the log in screen.

115
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.710
Okay.

116
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.430
Yet we can observe the house.

117
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.320
I think.

118
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.570
Over.

119
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.880
Okay.

120
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.710
This for this.

121
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.820
Can do as if.

122
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.390
Over here.

123
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.410
As if.

124
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.950
Else if the user.

125
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.470
It's a snapshot that has era.

126
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.750
If we have error, we can add this.

127
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.090
Okay.

128
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.130
I think that's it's not.

129
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.160
The okay of this.

130
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.680
So.

131
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.150
Okay.

132
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.070
User snapshot that has zero.

133
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.450
Okay.

134
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.440
Then.

135
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.300
We just want to return it since we jets to return it center.

136
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.580
We just.

137
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.230
These are.

138
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.570
Which is to say something.

139
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.740
What's wrong?

140
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.490
Okay.

141
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.090
Now the case.

142
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.930
You can see we are still in this era, I think.

143
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.610
Well, you can see a return.

144
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.930
Okay.

145
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.980
Okay.

146
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.970
Diya is gone.

147
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.270
It can just return an empty container for now.

148
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.690
Okay.

149
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.930
Okay.

150
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.720
Now, how to start this?

151
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.110
I think I'm just gonna come back to this again.

152
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.410
So you understand how the process works again.

153
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.790
Okay.

154
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.070
Check.

155
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.880
Check.

156
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.260
Okay.

157
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.140
Now, you can see currently we just logged in, so that's why it has to take us back to this log in

158
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.550
screen.

159
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.140
Okay, now definitely just snuggle around.

160
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.590
We just basically use this in order to get rid of that here.

161
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:08.770
Okay, now hold.

162
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.250
We start this to make sure it is working accurately.

163
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.740
Currently we have data, right?

164
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.150
So the.

165
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.760
Bottle noire has been displayed.

166
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.030
Okay.

167
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.440
Now what we are simply saying, we are simply using a distributor.

168
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.700
And as I said, distributor has a property known as Stream.

169
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:41.110
And the way we are sent, firebase, that is to start the changes is going to basically check if we

170
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.000
are either logged in or not.

171
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.760
Then why are you in the view there?

172
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.420
We have the contest and as well something known as user snapshots.

173
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:57.160
You can see this uses snapshots as a variable that has access to our Firebase data or our cloud store

174
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.700
data.

175
00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:58.840
Right.

176
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.270
And that's where we actively check in.

177
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:02.650
You.

178
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.670
These are snapshots of this coalition state.

179
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.650
That is it is trying to refresh the data, then we just want to return is sent to Egypt.

180
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.990
We just want to center our circle.

181
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.950
That progress indicator.

182
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.360
Okay.

183
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.040
Right.

184
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.480
And over year.

185
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:27.360
We are saying if it has finished loaded that's that says if use a snapshot doctors clinicians states

186
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.180
and say to clinicians stay active.

187
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:38.220
Then we are also checking again if the user as data if the user has data they want to telling the user

188
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.570
to the home screen.

189
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.760
That is the bottom of our house.

190
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.200
We just want to.

191
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.940
Keep the log in screen.

192
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.630
That's means.

193
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:52.980
There is no current user, no value where we are using an in-house use statement.

194
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.350
I think we can just get rid of this.

195
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.130
Okay.

196
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.780
Now that's a keep our code more simple.

197
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.030
Ah, since that's we barely run.

198
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.020
Okay.

199
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.640
We can also start this again.

200
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.420
So make sure.

201
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.680
It is accurately work in.

202
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.430
Okay.

203
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.940
Okay.

204
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.010
Okay.

205
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.730
Great.

206
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.640
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
