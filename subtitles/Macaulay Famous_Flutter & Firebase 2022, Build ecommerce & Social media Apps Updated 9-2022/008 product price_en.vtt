00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.750
Hi.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.500
In this lecture, they're going to display the product prize.

4
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.280
Okay.

5
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.340
Now, after the pardon record, the reason the row widgets are the reason for the row widgets is over

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.640
here.

7
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.830
We are going to have the prize in Hawaii.

8
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.930
We're going to have the hot button.

9
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.350
Okay.

10
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.260
So I started by then.

11
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.810
First of all, I just had the train come over.

12
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.460
That's a a very good format.

13
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.900
Okay.

14
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.210
So we can then have a project.

15
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.010
And as you know, the raw widget can take multiple widgets such as these children.

16
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.119
Okay.

17
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.180
Now, the first side of the row is going to be a colour widgets.

18
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.370
And the reason for this colour widget, this will they actually have the presence test?

19
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.080
Then at the bottom, they're going to have the product price.

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.460
Okay.

21
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.720
So there's going to be children.

22
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.970
And your first test.

23
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.820
He's going to say price.

24
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.300
Okay.

25
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.930
Now.

26
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.150
How did you recover and use concreteness to say.

27
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.840
Okay.

28
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.420
And where how did you come to?

29
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.140
This second test is going to be the product's price.

30
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.480
Okay.

31
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.150
The dollar sign is going to be products.

32
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.290
At three dot price.

33
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.800
Okay.

34
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.650
In this country.

35
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.690
You're a nurse to save it, to go check it out.

36
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.070
Okay.

37
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.880
You can see it over here.

38
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.020
Okay.

39
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.790
Now, what we can then do is we can take this to the bottom rise in the size box.

40
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.380
And Heidi's right.

41
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.260
So it's going to be Vertica of this is one of the 21st and see.

42
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.670
Okay.

43
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.530
I think it's okay.

44
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.640
Now, what you can do is rub this with the pardon as well.

45
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.310
You know, that's the meat of this.

46
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.890
This a good silversides on this display, right?

47
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.430
Okay.

48
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:07.370
But what you can do is you can use cuts or this test of entropy to just single party rights to affect

49
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.000
all rather than just wrap up into the pattern for each.

50
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.770
Well, for now, we can just go with that.

51
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.510
Hopefully you can do that so you can refactor your code.

52
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.910
Okay.

53
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.320
So what is.

54
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.090
Rebel happy to take part in.

55
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.830
Okay.

56
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.060
It's going to be symmetric, which has to do with either vertical or is that a okay, it's going to

57
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.600
be horizontal.

58
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.320
That is from left to right.

59
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.480
So you're going to see 25.

60
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.870
Okay.

61
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.280
He's got to announce to save.

62
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.140
Okay.

63
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.710
Great.

64
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.810
And now we can also start into this is going to be Starr is going to testify.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.240
And fond tweets.

69
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.550
You can see font tweets.

70
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.080
The boat and sea use control in this.

71
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.360
Okay.

72
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.410
As well we can.

Okay.

75
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.190
What you can do is you can use the W, you see Sandridge so it on that boat.

76
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.590
Okay.

77
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.790

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.420
This tie, it's going to test tie.

79
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.950
And we can say font size.

80
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.600

Okay.

85
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.190
So what we can do is.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.100
Over a year.

87
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.930
You can change the color to colors that gray.

Goods and.

90
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.670
So it is the where is in the column because we want to display this test and this this test price and

91
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.340
this product price vertically.

92
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.580
Right.
