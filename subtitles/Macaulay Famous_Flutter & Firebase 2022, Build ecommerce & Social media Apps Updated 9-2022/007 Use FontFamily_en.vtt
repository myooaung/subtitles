00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.970
In the last lecture, we had these two font family, and in this lecture, we're going to be able to

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.310
use this for family.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.200
But before then, please note, we are basically going to be using this brand Dashboard Font family

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.380
and basically just showed you that we can have multiple font family and you can use font different font

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.250
family for your different sections.

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.110
Like this text can have this brand as regular font family.

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.540
And this test of I can have the brand dashboard font family.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.750
Okay, but what we're going to be doing in this lecture is we're going to make our entire hub use this

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.540
brand dashboard family.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.660
In other words, every test we have over here is going to take this brand dashboard, font, family

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.000
shape.

14
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.620
Okay, I know that to do this, we're going to need to go to our main that's PHI, where we have our

15
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.350
full hub configuration of.

16
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:13.780
Now this same data has a property known as Fons family, and over here we can say we want to use the

17
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.940
brand dash board, font family boat as well.

18
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.220
You can say you want to use the brand dash regular or any of the font family you download it.

19
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.980
Okay.

20
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.020
So for me, I'm going to say we want to use the brand dashboard.

21
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.640
What family and what we can do.

22
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.130
We can have you try to come over here and three studies and go check.

23
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.020
Okay.

24
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.990
Or switch started.

25
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.810
Before military start.

26
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.440
It's going to hard to start this app now.

27
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.470
Okay.

28
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.340
You can see we just successfully changed our test for the family.

29
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.900
You can see everything is changed to this dashboard or to whatsoever you whatsoever font family you

30
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.590
downloaded.

31
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.650
Okay, so what we can do now, we can reduce the font size of this test in order to get rid of this

32
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.820
overflow error.

33
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.890
So to do that, we're going to need to go to the customize screen and.

34
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.300
Instead of 25, we can reduce it to 22 and see.

35
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.110
Okay.

36
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.740
Okay great.

37
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.050
We can just with this this to 20.

38
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.270
As well.

39
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.850
You can specify you really don't want to use that for the family code red dashboard over.

40
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.900
Yeah, I'd say okay you start the test as well.

41
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.040
Has a property load as sorry for that for the family and we can specify another type of family that

42
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.430
wants to use the dash regular.

43
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.980
So that should be one of the reason you would want to have different font family.

44
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.150
So you can you can use it for different sections of your hub.

45
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.220
Okay.

46
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.690
Okay, great.

47
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.540
Okay.

48
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.460
We can as well say Ford STI and Ford's STI.

49
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.110
So it's a look and see.

50
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.650
Okay.

51
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.920
Okay.

52
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.690
I think this is looking great.

53
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.000
Look, guys, say that.

54
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.610
That's lecture.
