00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.390
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.330
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.400
In this section, we're going to be able to search for products.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.460
Okay, then to do this, we need to go to the views directory and then the widget.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.600
And over here you can see we have the search imputes phi.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.880
Okay, now what we can do is we can use contra and bits to make this way.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.900
Okay.

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.510
Now the first thing we need to do is when the user clicks on this search, we are going to need to take

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.060
the user to the search screen and they are going to be able to search for products over here.

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.480
Okay.

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.180
Now, to do this, first of all, we need to make this test field a read all the field so that they

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
are not going to be able to search for products over here not to do this.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.140
All we just have to do is to go to the test field.

14
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.180
And the test field has a property known as the read only.

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.000
And then we're going to need to set it to true.

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.170
Okay.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.690
Now use contra and save and.

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.040
Okay.

19
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.890
And now click on this.

20
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.450
You can see.

21
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.580
You can see the tests the the keyboard is not popping out because we made it a read all the field.

22
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.580
Now what we can do now is to take the user to the cell screen and over here they are then going to be

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.060
with etc..

24
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.060
Okay, now this test field has a property known as on tap, okay?

25
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.500
And as we know is going to be a function and now we can then see now the you get all.

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.710
Thoughts of contest.

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.710
Dodd's push.

28
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.830
Okay.

29
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.730
And as you know, this is going to take in something known as Syria.

30
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.820
Page.

31
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.560
Roots.

32
00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.190
Okay, this is gonna take in context, and we can specify it as a type of beauty contest.

33
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.080
Okay.

34
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.750
And now we can then have this.

35
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.260
Okay.

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.100
I think we need to override this to see what we're missing.

37
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.060
Okay, I think we're missing one additional parenthesis.

38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.410
And now over here, we can then say return.

39
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.980
It's an.

40
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.550
What's such a typical this search screen?

41
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.680
Okay how did this and use country NASA save.

42
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.020
Okay.

43
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.720
And.

44
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.140
Okay.

45
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.420
Okay.

46
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.040
I'm just going to go back to the home screen and now let's click on this.

47
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.080
Okay.

48
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.250
You can see it's taking us to the screen.

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.730
Okay.

50
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.790
Now, all we can do now is to go to the search screen.

51
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.610
Now we can use control and B, to make this slide.

52
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.130
And we need to go to the search screen and use control and B.

53
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.620
Neither of the centre widgets gonna needs to get rid of the body as well.

54
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.200
We're just going to get rid of the centre first.

55
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.070
And then get rid of the body.

56
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.210
And now for the body, they're going to have to have the.

57
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.280
And have our.

58
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.480
Labor as well.

59
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.320
Okay.

60
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.490
And we can then have a title.

61
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.160
The title is then going to be the test.

62
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.140
Tess Field.

63
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.640
Okay now he's trying to save and but check this out.

64
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.280
Okay.

65
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.630
You going to sit over here?

66
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.980
Okay.

67
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.630
Now, what we can do is we can give you a broken or two.

68
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.430
This is going to be background color.

69
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.360
Color starts whites and use Katrina SC.

70
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.850
Okay.

71
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.300
Okay.

72
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.110
Now we can.

73
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.550
We can.

74
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.640
We can just go to the search.

75
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.150
Compute.

76
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.000
Such impute, we have that value.

77
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.890
And copy this test field.

78
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.320
Right.

79
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.700
Okay.

80
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.790
Okay.

81
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.460
Contraire.

82
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.350
Okay.

83
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.130
Okay.

84
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.700
Copy.

85
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.240
And.

86
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.590
You can see it as you write the key.

87
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.390
So that's why they're good.

88
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.410
Side of the trail, comma.

89
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.230
Okay.

90
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.200
Now, we can't get rid of this.

91
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.220
And is this?

92
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.270
And get rid of words.

93
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.420
And we don't need.

94
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.300
This on top.

95
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.850
Right.

96
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.840
And as well, we don't want this to be read only because we want to be able to say, okay, and now

97
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.170
we can then use control and se to save.

98
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.010
Okay.

99
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.740
Okay.

100
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.320
You can see.

101
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.000
Okay.

102
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.030
Now what we can do, you can see that hydro is no more.

103
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.920
We can also make it visible.

104
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.560
To make it visible within the.

105
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.250
Hub bar.

106
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.270
It has a property known as I contain.

107
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.100
This is going to be Icahn.

108
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.740
I can't.

109
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.540
I think.

110
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.560
I can't seem.

111
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.810
Then I got data.

112
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.500
They were going to say colors, colors, dots.

113
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.460
BLOCK okay.

114
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.210
According to Kumar, he is control and as the save you can see the way you know.

115
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.890
Okay.

116
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.460
Okay.

117
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.970
You can see.

118
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.230
Okay.

119
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.220
You can go back and work on this again.

120
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.350
Okay.

121
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.320
Sounds good, right?

122
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.710
Okay.

123
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.750
And what we can do is within the harbor, we can see elevation to zero.

124
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.780
And we don't want an elevation gaze control necessary to see what does.

125
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.420
Okay.

126
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.220
Okay, great.

127
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.050
Probably we can just say what I think is it's a bit nice.

128
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.890
Okay.

129
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.250
Or you can just get rid of that if you don't.

130
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.130
Okay.

131
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:23.590
Now, what we can as well is we can have an icon where the deletes the user test imputes to what the

132
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.520
users typed in.

133
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.910
Okay.

134
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.920
Now within the input declaration.

135
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.570
The test field has a property known as Sophie's.

136
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.840
Sophie's within the NPD equation.

137
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.050
Sorry, that aside, the equation, Sophie's icon.

138
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.430
Okay.

139
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.380
He's going to be an icon.

140
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.920
Widgets.

141
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.040
And.

142
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.680
And we can then say, I calls.

143
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.930
I called Scott Claire.

144
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.030
Okay.

145
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.340
Hopefully we have a consensus here in this country.

146
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.300
Okay.

147
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.390
You're going to see the value.

148
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.300
Okay.

149
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.730
Great.

150
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.810
And now while we can, as Virgil is over here.

151
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:16.370
If they use us the search for any products, we then need a test of our year, which is businesses search

152
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.680
for product or search products.

153
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:25.400
Okay, now we're going to need to come out from the harbour and within the scaffold, you know, this

154
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.920
property card body, and then we're going to need to center the widgets.

155
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.630
Okay, child.

156
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.090
And there's going to be a test widgets.

157
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.400
And we can.

158
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.520
Just say search for products.

159
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.340
Okay.

160
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.370
Aditya, how did you convert, use control and then save?

161
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.750
You're going to see it over a year now.

162
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.710
Okay.

163
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.720
What we can do is we can.

164
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.910
Studies.

165
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.080
To tie.

166
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:09.350
And we can increase the font size to 20 and font widths.

167
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.570
Font.

168
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.950
Okay.

169
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.110
Font wit and this movie font which.

170
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.840
Don't vote.

171
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.260
Okay.

172
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.240
Is country a necessary.

173
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.290
Okay.

174
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.010
Okay.

175
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.070
Since the right.

176
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:35.990
Okay.

177
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.870
For now, we don't have any functionality.

178
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.419
Okay.

179
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.500
Now we can go back and.

180
00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:44.920
Click on this.

181
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.650
Bloomberg.

182
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.240
We come.

183
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.980
This seems good, right?

184
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.010
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
