Okay.

25
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.090
Because secretly we own your screen.

26
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.210
Okay.

27
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.800

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.330
Okay, then we can pick this for you.

48
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.380
Okay.

49
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.680
Now you can see who's asking for the song name and the culture.

50
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.870
Those are the coaches that going to take some time in order for this video to upload.

51
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.190
Okay.

52
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:09.280
Okay.

53
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.030
I will consider this in order to resolve this problem.

54
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.490
Okay.

55
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.640
Now we can search for users.

56
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.540
Okay.

57
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.450
I think I have the user code smart.

58
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.940
Okay search you can see there's RS small quantity and we also have two smart.

59
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.580
Okay.

60
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.240
Like you can see, Smart has one last wish we just gave, and you can see the smart housing.

61
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.110
Followers looked following all followers, and whenever a user upload a video is automatically going

62
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.810
to generate each of the points you can see currently.

63
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.240
Smart has to videos.

64
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.690
It has automatically generated its own nils for this.

65
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.220
Now we can.

66
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.200
Follow Smart.

67
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.310
Okay.

68
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.150
You can see correctly now smart has what holders.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.800
Right.

70
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.180
Okay.

71
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.490
We can as well.

72
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.300
On follow smart.

73
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.790
Okay.

74
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.730
You can see it.

75
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.420
Just go follow.

76
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.410
Okay.

77
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.670
Then I'm going to go back.

78
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.760
Okay.

79
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.320
It is.

80
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.500
As you can see over here, we have.

81
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.110
One following on.

82
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.220
We have one likes we liked and it is just for smart.

83
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.630
Sorry is not ours.

84
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.130
I think this.

85
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.720
Okay, great.

86
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.310
They can see we are currently following one person and we have zero likes and zero followers.

87
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.130
Okay.

88
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.560
I think also the user code.

89
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.840
Mark, I mean.

90
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.320
Okay.

91
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.020
You can see Mark at me, my colleague Peter.

92
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.740
Well, this uses rights, okay.

93
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.470
I can click on luckily.

94
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.340
Okay.

95
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.390
You can see the code currently has is following one user.

96
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.210
You can also follow my colleague because you can see now he has two followers and zero follower.

97
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.200
McCauley has zero following and zero lacks variety can as well all follow.

98
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.660
Okay.

99
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.470
Okay.

100
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.100
Okay.

101
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.320

102
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.790
Okay.

103
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.990
Okay.

104
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.140
This is not this is going to take some time not to just play hearts.

105
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.790
Okay.

106
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.840
Because I'm having a very small network.

107
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.030
Okay.

108
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.700
You can see.

109
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.660
Like I said, we can choose to applaud from either gallery or camera.

110
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.240
Okay, just consider this then.

111
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.860
It's going be displayed at the home screen.

112
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.590
You can see.

113
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.980

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.530
Okay.

115
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.990
You can see this weekend as well like this.

116
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.590
Okay.

117
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.680
We're just going to commence.

118
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.460
Nice.

119
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.300
Okay.

120
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.690
Extinction.

121
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.660
Okay.

122
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.340

Great.

125
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.940
Okay.

126
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.580
Okay.

127
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.930
Okay, guys.

128
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.050
And please note this tick tock section is currently under development, but in the short time all the

129
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.310
video several of you uploaded.

130
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.740
So feel free to arrow course.

131
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.110
You can read an article, then allow a future sequel and not to use Firebase as well.

132
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.930
You can see all our users over here.

133
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.420
We also have the storage.

134
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.830
We have our videos, some meals for you.

135
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.400
Image are going to be okay.

136
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.820
You can see we have the videos we have.

137
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.880
We have the Sunnies, we have the profile pictures of all users you can see can do can go for this you

138
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.420
can see the profile image of the user getting this, the account we just created.

139
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.370
Okay.

140
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.940
Like I said, whenever a user uploads a video is automatically going to generate.

141
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.080
It's all new for it.

142
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.290
So you can learn a lot about flow to acquire base.

143
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.990
And please note the UI is first crash and also all the backend is from scratch.

144
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.140
No copy code, everything is built on from scratch.

145
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.610
In order for you to do graphs, all the process of like Flutter and Firebase.

146
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.790
Guess it is a video and it automatically generates.

147
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.620
It's all new for me as well.

148
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.950
You can see the toenails.

149
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.270
Okay.

150
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.270
See this?

151
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.740
If you're going to sit over here.

152
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.260
And our users.

153
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.270
Olivier.

154
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.700
Right.

155
00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.290
You can.

156
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.030
You can see we are following.

157
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.980
Okay.

158
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.420
I can see.

159
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.180
Follow us.

160
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.850
Okay.

161
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.490
So we have the midfield midfield.

162
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.710
So if I feel for five foot two and you idiot, you're going to do all of this right from scratch.

163
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.160
Okay?

164
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.090
Okay, guys, see you in the course.
