00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.120
In this lecture, we are going to start building the category screen.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.360
Now, what we have to do first is to create a new file over this views directory.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.820
We are going to create a new file and we're going to call this file category on the score screen and

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.830
then the section is door dots.

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.400
And now we can use control and bits to make this wide.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.340
And for the now we can just go with the stateless widget and since we can update it to stateful widget

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.990
if the need arise.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.670
A case that lest we forget and also we have to court this category screen.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.200
And over here, we need to alight and use control dots in that same part, the material that that package.

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.870
And we could get rid of this.

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.920
And now that we have access to a lot of property, we can then return a scaffold.

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.180
Scaffold.

15
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.860
And as you know, the scaffold has a property, such has the body.

16
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.940
And for the body we can just have a sensor widget for now which is going to have a child and it says

17
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.300
widgets which is going to say category.

18
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.120
Screen.

19
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.870
Okay.

20
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.710
This contract is to save and over the mandate file.

21
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:34.970
What we can also do is instead of having to log in all the time, we could just use this custom home

22
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.660
customer home screen to be the initial route.

23
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.410
That is the first page the user is going to see.

24
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.830
But in the future we are going to be able to possess the user.

25
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.140
So whenever a user logs in once, they do not have to log in all the time whenever they desire to use

26
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.100
the app again.

27
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.100
Okay.

28
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.520
How to start this?

29
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.590
Sorry.

30
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.270
So we have to go to the customer home screen and.

31
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.410
Over.

32
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.820
Yeah.

33
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.780
We have to get rid of this sensor widget.

34
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.580
Right, and use the screen.

35
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.690
We just created that category screen and art.

36
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.550
We start.

37
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.570
And now we can start building the category.

38
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.020
Screen the K.

39
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.860
Over.

40
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.990
Look, you can just check this out for us.

41
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.240
You can see we have we are currently in the homescreen and the category screen.

42
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.170
You can see the view back to the category screen.

43
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.620
We can use this control to make this wide and we have to get rid of this center widget.

44
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.390
Okay.

45
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.110
Now, the first widget we're going to be using is a widget known as Stack.

46
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.640
You basically use a stock widget to place widgets onto widgets.

47
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.420
Okay.

48
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.120
And the stack widget has a property known as children.

49
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.010
And their first child is going to be a container.

50
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.070
And we're going to give this container a color, a color of colors that gray.

51
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.140
And we can also have hard shades to this.

52
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.120
We can see a shade of Syrian red.

53
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.980
We think we need that over there.

54
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.790
You try to cover and use control and that's to save.

55
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.710
You can't see this.

56
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.080
And as you know, the container has a property known as.

57
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.620
And instead of giving this 500 or 600, we're going to make this responsive.

58
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.180
And to do this, we have to first get the height of our entire screen.

59
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.150
And to do that, we have to say media.

60
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.280
Media query of contest.

61
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.030
Dot size.

62
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:18.149
Dot hides, and we can times this by 80% by 0.8 OC and also we can also give this a width.

63
00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.880
The Heights is basically referring to how long it's going to be.

64
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.460
That is from year to year.

65
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.380
That is the vertical form and the width has to do the horizontal form.

66
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.500
That is how wide is going to be like for the width.

67
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:40.980
In order to make this responsive, we also do need to use the media query that's of contest dot size,

68
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.480
then dot width, and we need 20% of the screen.

69
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.030
Okay.

70
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.110
This country needs to save now and.

71
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.460
You can sit over here.

72
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.540
You can see.

73
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.350
Okay.

74
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.840
Now, the next thing we're going to need to do is we're going to take this container to the bottom and

75
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.920
also to the left.

76
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.380
And I think currently it's at the left side.

77
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:14.200
To do that, the container, we are going to wrap this with a widget known as Position a light and use

78
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.360
control dots and wrappers widget.

79
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.280
Position.

80
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.340
Position.

81
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.900
Okay.

82
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.620
And now the position has a property known as bottom.

83
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.430
We are going to set it to zero.

84
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.670
That means we do not want any space.

85
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.360
So automatically it's going to take this to the bottom is control and save.

86
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.450
And you're going to see it, right?

87
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.840
All right.

88
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.760
You can see and we can be sure of taking this to the left.

89
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.890
I think it's already out the left side, but we can just see left.

90
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.730
Zero.

91
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.690
Okay.

92
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.700
Is true and save.

93
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.750
Okay.

94
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.460
And now what we can just do, we can just copy this and paste this.

95
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.640
You can see it has the stock widget has a property known as children.

96
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.340
So it can take multiple widgets.

97
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.630
Okay.

98
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.860
So we can just see this as the first child and this as a second child.

99
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.690
And for this.

100
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.530
We are going to say colors that red is contra and save.

101
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.980
And you're going to see it over here.

102
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.780
Over there, too.

103
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.250
So what we have to do, we have to change the position of how this container is going to be placed for

104
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.800
the boats.

105
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.740
We can also say zero.

106
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.720
But this is going to be right.

107
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.110
And you can see it all via.

108
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.770
Okay, great.

109
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.680
And now what we can also do, we can increase the width of this container.

110
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.640
And for the weeds, we can say we need 80% of our screen.

111
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.120
Okay.

112
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.790
Great.

113
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.870
This is good, right?

114
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.340
And now instead of red.

115
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.840
We could use a white color.

116
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.440
And.

117
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.890
Great.

118
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.360
Sounds good, right?

119
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.670
I think this is very cool.

120
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.040
Look, guys, see you in the next lecture.
