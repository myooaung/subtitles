00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.380
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.160
In this lecture, we are finally going to be able to have a product so our cards.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.470
But before then this should be written on the score list and dot lens.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.710
And all this will basically do is it will get us how many products we have had there to our cards.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.820
And what we have to do next is to display the habit item.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.430
To do this, we have to go to the cards screen.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.470
Cut screen.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.020
And we can use try and be.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.300
For now.

11
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.160
We are just going to comment this from this center with that and to where it ends, it hands over it

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.400
and we can just commit this OC.

13
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.610
Sorry.

14
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.380
We can just shift this first so it shifts.

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.180
And now we can alight.

16
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.060
It ends.

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.860
Yeah, and we can comment.

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.530
Now we're going to be using something which you've not seen before.

19
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.840
It is known as Cosima.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.850
Consumer.

21
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.120
The consumer has a property known as beta, and the beta is going to take in something known as contest,

22
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.420
which you've seen before, and also something known as value, which is not seen before.

23
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.640
And lastly, it's going to take something known as child.

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.070
Okay.

25
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.740
And we need this.

26
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.490
Our function.

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.330
Sorry, we are just going to use this type of function, okay?

28
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.580
And over here we can specify it is a type of cards provider that is a card provider class.

29
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.500
Operator.

30
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.520
And if you don't know what the value is, you can see this value as a variable that has access to all

31
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.600
what the cards provider class has.

32
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.700
Or you can just see this value as a variable that stores the card provider class or something like this.

33
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.840
I'm just going to show you a finer and it'd be value equal to.

34
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.640
Kutz.

35
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.900
Provide a class.

36
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.530
Okay.

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.160
So what we can just do is instead of saying value, we can.

38
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.850
Rename this to.

39
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.740
We can rename this variable to something like cards provider.

40
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420
Okay, great.

41
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.860
And over here we are going to return a list view, list, view.

42
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.470
Please view that leader.

43
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.240
Okay.

44
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.560
And as you know, the hearts and beta.

45
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.230
It's going to take something known as contest.

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.200
And lastly, the intense grit.

47
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.450
I think over here we need a semicolon and over here we need a comma.

48
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.760
Okay.

49
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.680
I think we still have.

50
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.220
Okay, yeah, we're going to have this error and for now we are then going to return it test.

51
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.120
We just.

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.630
Okay.

53
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.650
And we can display the name of the product for now to do this.

54
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.910
We are going to call this card provider.

55
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.310
Remember I said you can see this card provider as a variable that stores these cards per provider class.

56
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:28.900
And now we can say that DOT gets items and we want to assess each dead card item based on the index

57
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.910
and we just want to assess the name of the products.

58
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.500
Okay.

59
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.220
And this is basically all we need.

60
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.160
And as you know, within the list, view the builder.

61
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.760
It has a property known as item counts.

62
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.920
And this is going to be the card provider that counts.

63
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.140
Okay, great.

64
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.160
The count is referring to the counts we have over over here.

65
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.130
Overall.

66
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.620
You're right.

67
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.320
And to get items is referring to this right.

68
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.290
And you can see over here we are basically adding to that variable.

69
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.640
Okay.

70
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.840
And back to.

71
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.040
The car screen.

72
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.029
And this is basically all we need to do in order to display the card item data.

73
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.480
Okay.

74
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.860
Now, the next thing we have to do is we have to wrap our entire widgets or our entire hub with this

75
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.830
cards provider class.

76
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.520
To do this, we have to go to the.

77
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.010
The main ..5.

78
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.780
Right.

79
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.150
Okay.

80
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.060
Little dots.

81
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:50.080
And in this map, what we can do is we can alight and use controller and dots and we're going to wrap

82
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.180
this with widgets.

83
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.560
And this is going to be something which you've not seen before.

84
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.830
It is known as multi provider.

85
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.490
Okay.

86
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:07.430
Rig this the multi provider can take multiple provider and you can see currently we have just one provider

87
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.840
that is the card provider.

88
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.800
And since it can take multiple providers, it has a property known as providers.

89
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.610
You can see it is a list because it can take multiple provider.

90
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.170
Okay.

91
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.340
And we're going to wrap our card provider with something known as Change Notifier provider, which is

92
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.240
very similar to the change notifier change notified provider.

93
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.040
And for the create, we are going to leave it empty by adding the underscore.

94
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.250
And over here we are going to return the cards provider.

95
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.420
Provider.

96
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.350
And this is basically all we need to do in the main file.

97
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.810
And now we can use control and save.

98
00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:01.920
And what we then want to do is when we click on the heart so called button, we want to have that item

99
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.970
to our cart.

100
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.520
To do this, we have to go to the detail directory and then the product detail.

101
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.450
And over here you can see we have the hard to card button, right?

102
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.520
And within this function, what we have to do is to call provider.

103
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.610
Provider.

104
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.660
Provider.

105
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.850
And then lot of contest.

106
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.580
And over here, we are also going to specify it is a type of card provider.

107
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.800
And they had.

108
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.490
Okay sorry.

109
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:43.140
And now we can then say that had had item and you can see he's asking for the value for the name of

110
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:50.730
the products, the price of the products, the quantity, the stock, the images, your URL, the document

111
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.830
ID and lastly, the seller ID for the product.

112
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.220
So for the name of the product is going to be the name we have in our database and.

113
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.530
So this is going to be a product list.

114
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.310
Product lists and products.

115
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.500
Name.

116
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.040
Okay.

117
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.130
And for the prize, this is going to be products laced.

118
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.050
And price.

119
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:36.100
And for the quantity is basically referring to how many of that products the user wants to buy and default.

120
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.340
We are going to set it to one and four.

121
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.400
The stock is basically referring to how many products we have.

122
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.340
Okay.

123
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.870
For this.

124
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.690
This is going to be products least.

125
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.040
And in stock.

126
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.470
Okay.

127
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.810
And for the images.

128
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.640
This is going to be product list.

129
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.620
Then.

130
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.440
I think we call it US products.

131
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.490
Image.

132
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.400
If you've forgotten this, you can just go to the upload, upload a file where we uploaded all this

133
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.820
product.

134
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:23.080
You can see products, image and stock price, product name, product ID and so on.

135
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.620
Okay.

136
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.620
Okay.

137
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:32.890
And for the document ID is going to be the product ID.

138
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.570
So this is going to be product list.

139
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.090
And products, Heidi.

140
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:47.370
Make sure you don't have any spell error and or sorry, any spell mistake has you can get some errors.

141
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.590
And this is going to be product.

142
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.470
Least.

143
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.130
Then seller you, Heidi.

144
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.980
And this is basically what we need to do.

145
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.630
Okay.

146
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.190
And lastly.

147
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.740
Right.

148
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.750
We are going to have a trailer commercial and we are going to say listen and we are going to set it

149
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.120
to force in the future.

150
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.890
I'm going to show you the reason for this.

151
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.080
And this is basically it.

152
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.010
And all we have to do now is to hold restart this.

153
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.840
Or we start.

154
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:29.860
And then we should be able to try this out without any errors.

155
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.290
Okay.

156
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.030
It's going to take some time to start.

157
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.160
Okay.

158
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.450
Okay.

159
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:42.940
And now I'm just going to log into the customer accounts, so I'm going to click on sign up.

160
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.030
Okay.

161
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.000
I think this should be taking us to the seller accounts and not the customer.

162
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.200
Okay.

163
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.690
We are currently in the customer's screen.

164
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:54.570
Right.

165
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.160
Okay.

166
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.500
There's an error concerning this navigation.

167
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.220
I believe you can just fix that yourself.

168
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.430
And I'm going to log in and I think I have.

169
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.520
An account known as my colleague.

170
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:22.200
Famous email, dead calm and password is BGR and AC and click on log in and hopefully I have a strong

171
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.980
network.

172
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.240
Okay.

173
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.040
Okay.

174
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.870
Sorry for that dog.

175
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.830
Okay.

176
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.660
And.

177
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.670
Okay.

178
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.270
And we can.

179
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.090
Try this out.

180
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.120
Okay, I'm gonna click on this.

181
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.130
I think we have some slow network cards.

182
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.780
And go to the car screen.

183
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.070
Okay.

184
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.430
Man to jog.

185
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.150
I don't know.

186
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.660
There.

187
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.760
Men.

188
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.530
Okay.

189
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.120
Okay.

190
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.020
I think we have not fixed that button yet.

191
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.110
Okay.

192
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.220
Okay.

193
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.820
I'm just going to start this video quickly because of that barking dog.

194
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.740
But before they are just going to have another again, maybe from the women category.

195
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.730
But Kay and.

196
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.180
How to cut.

197
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.380
And check it out.

198
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.720
OC walking as expected.

199
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.000
