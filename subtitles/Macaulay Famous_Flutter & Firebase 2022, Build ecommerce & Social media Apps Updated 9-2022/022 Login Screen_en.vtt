00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.750
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.220
Now we are currently locked in, but we are still in the login page.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.900
So now what you can do?

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.340
You can create a new page.

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.370
So when the user clicks on log in is as we are going to take the user to the new page.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.770
Okay.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.970
Now to do this, first of all, I'm just going to close this.

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720
Then I will go to five.

10
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.350
Okay.

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.060
To leave.

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.170
Right.

13
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.549
Then in the views of.

14
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.190
And you fly over the screens.

15
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900
I will create a new fly.

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.740
And to call this fly home or this screen.

17
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.090
The Dutch.

18
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.120
Okay.

19
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.010
Now, now, can you just use this stateless widget as well?

20
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.950
I'm going to call this screen.

21
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.300
Right.

22
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.740
Then over here, I want to highlight the number of these control and dots.

23
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.090
And that's a part of the material that that package.

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.470
Okay.

25
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.410
Those are the fruits on a container.

26
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.410
We can return this car forward so we have access to lots of property.

27
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.980
So this is going to be the body.

28
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.570
We can't just sit center for now.

29
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.550
It's going to be charged and it's going to be a test widget.

30
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.590
We can just.

31
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.490
Logged.

32
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.730
Okay.

33
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.060
Great.

34
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.460
So in order to navigate to this page, I would just have to do is to go to how?

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.890
Hot controller.

36
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.410
Okay, now I'm going to use Control B to make this wider.

37
00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:04.170
Now, apart from printing the logged in already as well, if this fields are not empty or you distort

38
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.760
issue.

39
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.870
What we also want to do want to go to that pacer to do that.

40
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.860
Hold this up.

41
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.050
To do as we tend to do.

42
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.560
Right.

43
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.780
You're going to get that.

44
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.630
Of all.

45
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.570
Now you can see this fix your page.

46
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.120
So we are going to pass the old.

47
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.060
Screen.

48
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.350
Right.

49
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.530
Okay.

50
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.260

51
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.190
Okay.

52
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.540
Great.

57
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.000
So what you can do.

58
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.440
We can.

59
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.720
So test.

60
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.590

61
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.320
Okay.

62
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.840

You said the password is not correct.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.790
Guess we have cool validation as well.
