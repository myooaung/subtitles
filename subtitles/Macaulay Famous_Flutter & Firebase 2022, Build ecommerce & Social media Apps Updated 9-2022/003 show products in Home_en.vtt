00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.210
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.850
Oracle, in this lecture, we're going to display the products in the whole screen.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.570
Okay.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.800
Not to do this.

5
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.310
We are going to need to go to the single product design.

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.910
So we're going to go to the widgets then.

7
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.180
You're going to go to the products.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.880
Okay.

9
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.220
And now we can then use control and B to make this white OC regular do the same thing.

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.570
Right.

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.090
So I am just going to do this.

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.210
So it must as you.

13
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
I can just copy what it is going to do with my start the process.

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.640
Okay.

15
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.410
So we are going to create a final variable and we can.

16
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.680
Call is rebel for doubts.

17
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.730
What you can just do.

18
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.240
We can just make this private space fully accessible within this page.

19
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.650
You can call this products for by the.

20
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.280
There's going to be core to the provider, right?

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.900
It doesn't look like or this way it automatically imports it.

22
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.920
Okay.

23
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.840
Then there's going to be lots of.

24
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.820
That's of.

25
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.810
I think it's not yet important to use.

26
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.160
Okay.

27
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.930
Okay, then.

28
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.090
Start of contest.

29
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.140
Okay.

30
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.830
Idea.

31
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.680
So we call on ten over here.

32
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.300
A lot of us in the startups.

33
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.120
Provide a class for us.

34
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.620
Okay, then.

35
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.900
Create a verbal card.

36
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.520
So that we can also make this.

37
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.840
Private products list.

38
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.000
And this is going to be a core to the product.

39
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.610
Provider.

40
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.780
The webinar says that a variable in the class or within the class scored.

41
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.940
Four.

42
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.760
That's okay.

43
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.160
And now we're going to need to specify the type.

44
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.170
It is a type of list.

45
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.230
And is it out of the products model for dogs?

46
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.479
Okay, great.

47
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.440
That's basically it.

48
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.350
Now, what we're going to do is over this image.

49
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.060
They're going to get rid of this.

50
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.860
And there's going to be.

51
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.900
Currently we are still using the assets may go in the future.

52
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.830
We are going to be using the network image.

53
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.930
Okay, this is digital player.

54
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.490
Okay, so now what we are going to do is we're going to call that FedEx.

55
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.700
So we are this car so forgot.

56
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.820
This.

57
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.780
Then I to see zero standards.

58
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.040
Images will not see us in zero is going to fetch all the images go it just says it just go fetch the

59
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.320
first image.

60
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.020
We are right.

61
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.830
So what you're going to do is we're in the past in the intense.

62
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.490
Okay.

63
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.500
So now what you can do is.

64
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.490
Where we can then create.

65
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.100
If China is going to be a type of aid, then it is, as you've seen it before then because they took

66
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.120
over and required this field, then passed it on to the constructor by saying this dirt Indians.

67
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.870
Okay.

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.330
Great.

69
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.840
Now the issue is we also need to do some changes in this fight.

70
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.340
Right.

71
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.500
Because any time we pass this recall, this paradox item, we need to as well pass the intensity with

72
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.100
required.

73
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.190
So what we can then do is we can highlight and use control dots.

74
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.220
You can see how to acquire argument index.

75
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.540
Okay.

76
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
And for the null attendee to index.

77
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.860
Okay.

78
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.310
So it is basically iterating over this intense thought, right.

79
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.980
It's simply the starting point.

80
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.510
Right?

81
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.710
Simply with what?

82
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.390
The stats in.

83
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.750
Point.

84
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.390
Okay.

85
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.420
And now we can then use control.

86
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.520
And.

87
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.080
We?

88
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.670
Okay.

89
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.960
Just need to quietly start this.

90
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.279
Okay.

91
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.730
Or we start this.

92
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.760
In case you do understand, you can do well to let me know.

93
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.030
So I try to explain better to you.

94
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.880
Okay.

95
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.880
I think there's a right.

96
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.380
Okay.

97
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.040
He's walking.

98
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.320
So the next we're going to do is the prize.

99
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.250
So we're going to go back to the individual design for each product and call that five products.

100
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.930
So we're going to scroll down.

101
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.700
Without a doubt.

102
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.650
Kudos to those who think this is their product name.

103
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.180
Get rid of this.

104
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.080
And get rid of this trust is very productive I think with private.

105
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.760
So that's least.

106
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.420
Right.

107
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.810
Then intense and then starts.

108
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.190
I think it is the title to.

109
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.680
Okay.

110
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.460
Great.

111
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.890
Now for the price as well.

112
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.110
We're going to need to get rid of this discovery underscore.

113
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:34.660
And the score for that list, then it tends to look for the item that is going to be thought.

114
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.840
Price.

115
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.820
They're going to need to convert it to the strength to tell that it's going to be a test.

116
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.570
Okay.

117
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.310
Like Malek Overton, it's a test.

118
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.850
Okay, great.

119
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.510
Are you going to see a nine, nine and 19 and what you can just do?

120
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.870
We can add this to it.

121
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.090
Those are the hardest days.

122
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.960
And get rid of this to string it over here.

123
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.280
They're going to hide this.

124
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.470
In a way you can had this.

125
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.450
The way we can learn how to dollar sign and we can use the backslash.

126
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.010
And have a look at dollar sign.

127
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.930
Right.

128
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.340
Okay.

129
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.450
He's going to try to save.

130
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.570
Okay.

131
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.040
Great.

132
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.920
She was good.

133
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.540
As all you can do for the film screen.

134
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.820
They can.

135
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.860
Okay.

136
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.850
Fields screen.

137
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.300
Okay.

138
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.210
Okay.

139
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.160
I think we have the design in the.

140
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.820
In this fields products.

141
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.680
Okay.

142
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.210
It was Earl.

143
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.200
And the price should be okay.

144
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.270
So we can do this in.

145
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.020
Now get rid of this two string.

146
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.700
Add this.

147
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.000
And this.

148
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.930
And this.

149
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.540
And your daughter.

150
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.270
Okay.

151
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.550
We can and that's easier.

152
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.620
The dollar nat is dollar.

153
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.410
We can use the bucks.

154
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.240
Just keep it and then we can have another dollar.

155
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.930
Okay.

156
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.210
I think we should walk.

157
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.180
Okay.

158
00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.070
Okay.

159
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.160
Okay.

160
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.300
Sounds good.

161
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.570
And in this lecture or in the future lecture, they're going to look for a way to improve.

162
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:11.970
Okay?

163
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.980
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
