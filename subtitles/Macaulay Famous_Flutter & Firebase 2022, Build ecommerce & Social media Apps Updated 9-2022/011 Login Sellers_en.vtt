00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.400
In this lecture, we are going to be able to log in.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.260
Sellers Okay, now to do this, we have to head up to the seller login screen and what we can do, we

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.150
can use control and B to make this slide.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.780
Okay.

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.620
Now the first step is to add validation to this two fields, that is the email field and the password

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.070
field.

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.720
Okay.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.440
And as you know, the test field has a property known as validator and it is a callback.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.840
So over this parentheses, we're going to pass in something known as value, which is basically referring

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.910
to the inputs of the user.

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.040
And now we can have some check.

14
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.590
So we are going to create an if statement and we can then say if value.

15
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:58.030
That is, if the dot is empty, we need an of fire and I'm going to get rid of this if it is empty.

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.100
We then want to return a test which is going to say please email address.

17
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:19.330
Must not be empty and empty, or else if it is filled in, we then want to basically do nothing.

18
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.850
Return.

19
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.300
No.

20
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.090
Okay.

21
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.750
Great.

22
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.230
And we have to do this for the password field.

23
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.180
Right.

24
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.210
And as you know, within the telephone field, it has a property known as validator and value, which

25
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.280
is referring to the input of the user.

26
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.250
And now we can have an E statement to say Value dot is empty.

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.060
Sorry.

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.830
Look here.

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.680
Valley dirt is empty.

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.990
We need another check via.

31
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.010
Vedat is empty and.

32
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.750
We want to return excess, which is going to say please feels.

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.460
Fitz must not be.

34
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.550
Empty.

35
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.770
So password.

36
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.200
Password must not be empty.

37
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.950
Else.

38
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.710
We then want to return north.

39
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.460
Okay.

40
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.460
Sounds good.

41
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.380
And in order to make this validator work, we have to create a form key.

42
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.980
To do that, we're going to do this at the top over here.

43
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.070
We can go ahead and specify finer and specify the type of variable.

44
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.340
And it is also a type of form states.

45
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.450
And we can call this variable on the score from form key.

46
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.020
And it's going to be equal to global.

47
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.050
Blue Bar key.

48
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.040
Global.

49
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.090
Not global, but global key and farm state.

50
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.980
Okay.

51
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.340
And now we have to bind this variable to our form.

52
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.090
To do that, we have to wrap this entire column.

53
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.090
That is the column, the appearance column with a form.

54
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.820
And the reason we are wrapping it with the form is so we have access to the key and that's we use this

55
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.610
form key.

56
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.800
Okay.

57
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.230
Is concerned and grapples with debt and this is going to be formed.

58
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.180
And as you know, the firm has a property known as key.

59
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.150
Then it's going to be equal to this on the score.

60
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.130
KEY okay.

61
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.320
This is basically all we need for validation, right?

62
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:47.430
And now we can check again if it is validated over year, over year, what we can do in order to make

63
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.880
this clean, we can just create a new function at the top.

64
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.680
Yet we can then say if.

65
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.800
So we can, first of all, create a function and we're going to call this function log in sellers or

66
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.490
seller.

67
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.330
Right.

68
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.000
And now we can have a try.

69
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.150
And the cast block.

70
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.330
So we try.

71
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.850
Try and catch.

72
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.910
Okay.

73
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.120
And we tend to try block.

74
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:27.430
We can then have an if statement and say if on the score from key the word document states the words

75
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.900
validate.

76
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.830
If it is validate, we need an article by as well.

77
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.030
If it is validated, then what we basically want to do for now is to print.

78
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.120
Could.

79
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.520
Good.

80
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.740
As if it is not validated.

81
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.390
We want to print.

82
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.940
But.

83
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.870
Right.

84
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.790
A K notepad.

85
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.180
What bad?

86
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.040
Is it necessary?

87
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.090
And if I click on.

88
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.820
Okay.

89
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.920
Click on this is is currently not valid.

90
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.550
Right.

91
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.770
And open your seminar.

92
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.540
Terminer.

93
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.360
And put.

94
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.770
You can see we have barred because.

95
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.080
Because it is currently not valid.

96
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.280
Right.

97
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.240
So it seems good.

98
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.950
What we are going to do is if it is valid, we then want to log into the user and to do that we need

99
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.640
to use the odd package that is the Firebase card.

100
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.240
So we have to import it over here and go and specify this type of firebase words.

101
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.240
And you can call this report on this call or it is going to be equal to Firebase or it.

102
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.780
Though it's Easton's OC.

103
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:53.040
And what we have to do is it's going to take some time so we can tell FILATOV We are ready to wait and

104
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.260
we want that line of code to be executed before another code gets run.

105
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.080
So that's why we are basically using the airwaves and over here we can just get rid of this code and

106
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.690
call the weights.

107
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.460
So we have to use async and that's easy it.

108
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.060
And now we can call the variable underscore and then say sign in user.

109
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.470
Which email and password.

110
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.740
Sign in user with email and.

111
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.130
Its email password is asking for the email and password.

112
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.400
So what we can do, we can create a variable to store the value of the user.

113
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.550
So via we can just go ahead and create a variable.

114
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.330
It's going to be late.

115
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.330
And the reason for this late is because we do not want to assign any value to it at this moment.

116
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.160
And we are spitting, it says.

117
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.540
So email.

118
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.290
And.

119
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.900
String.

120
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.950
And late string password.

121
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.550
Okay.

122
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.200
Great.

123
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.260
And also get the value.

124
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.960
Hopefully we have the US.

125
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.570
Okay.

126
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.970
To get the value.

127
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.650
The telephone field has a property known as on change.

128
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.190
So within the telephone field we can then see on change and we're going to pass on the value.

129
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.760
Why and then say email is equal to password.

130
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.470
Right.

131
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.170
Sorry.

132
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.200
We're required to follow you.

133
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.080
The value, right?

134
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.730
The value of what's everybody's going to type in that is the inputs.

135
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.670
And over here.

136
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.360
That is for the.

137
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.930
Sorry, this is going to be password, right?

138
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.650
Password and we have to do that for the email feed as well.

139
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.540
Okay.

140
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.580
The email field and as you know, or change within the test form field and value which is referring

141
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:01.190
to the inputs and email is going to be equal to this value.

142
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.150
Okay.

143
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:04.940
Great.

144
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.250
That is basically it.

145
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.030
And that is basically.

146
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:18.410
All we need and over the Scotch block what we can do if the error is order from this.

147
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.950
That is if the field is filled in.

148
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:30.040
If the area is different from what we have over between the EIF and LS, then we want to catch that

149
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.550
error.

150
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.630
To do that, we can just return the snack bar to show the user the error.

151
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.890
It could be maybe the email already exists or password does not match or something similar or network

152
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.429
issue.

153
00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.190
We didn't want to return the snack bar to the user.

154
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:53.480
Snug Bear and for the title it's going to be E, this E, which is very into the error code.

155
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.080
C d I think we have to convert this to a string.

156
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.040
Over in this get a code is the foreign object, unfortunately.

157
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:06.930
Okay.

158
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.360
What we can just do for now, we can.

159
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.760
We can't you can see it's basically a in the chest test over here for now.

160
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.260
We can just say something went okay.

161
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.600
Something went wrong.

162
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.300
Okay.

163
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.320
How is this over here?

164
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.690
And if the field is not filled in.

165
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.400
Sorry.

166
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.480
But the fields are not filled.

167
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.340
And we want to return a snack.

168
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:37.790
Where?

169
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.010
It's like we're just going to copy this.

170
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.970
I don't really like copying for the sake of you mastering it.

171
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.560
Okay.

172
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.740
And his this and this is going to be.

173
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.550
Please.

174
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.210
Please.

175
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.480
Fields.

176
00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.670
Was not.

177
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.220
Must not be empty.

178
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.510
And Pepsi is concerned.

179
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.520
Nestle safe now.

180
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.210
And go try this out.

181
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.540
Okay.

182
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.520
After I successfully logging the user, what we can do, we can see prints.

183
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:20.850
Seller.

184
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.900
Our own.

185
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.530
Okay.

186
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.040
Great.

187
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.210
Or you can just start this.

188
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.680
Okay.

189
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.910
Now click on this.

190
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.780
Okay.

191
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.490
Now what can we have to start?

192
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.470
Well, it will start.

193
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.660
It's going to take some time.

194
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.140
And that was why I never wanted to do it in your presence.

195
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.650
But you can just go ahead and see for yourself.

196
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.160
Okay.

197
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.300
And now we can try this out.

198
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.030
Sign up and log in and click on this.

199
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.120
So we have to call it a function.

200
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.110
Okay.

201
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.060
We have to call the function.

202
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.710
Over a year.

203
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.910
Right.

204
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.290
A function is just a block of code that gets executed whenever it is called.

205
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.210
Called seller.

206
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.440
Log in.

207
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.100
Seller.

208
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.590
So we've called the function now, so it's going to get executed.

209
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.650
Whenever I click on this like you can see, please feel must not be M.S. So all you just have to do

210
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.370
is to create an account over here in case you have.

211
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.410
Is to create a seller's account in case you forgot the.

212
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.470
Create a seller's account via.

213
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.920
In case you forgot the account details, then you can then log into it.

214
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.200
And I think you have to rename this to create customized accounts because if we are in the seller's

215
00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:00.080
screen, then we should be able to go to the screen to create a customer account if we do not want to

216
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.860
do that.

217
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.060
Okay.

218
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.840
And I think that or you can just customize it any way you want.

219
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.680
So what you have to do correctly is to create a seller's account and after that logging into it and

220
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:20.990
you have to check your your or output over here to see if it has been successfully logged in.

221
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:26.120
You're going to see a home screen over there because that is what we are basically saying.

222
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:33.230
After successfully logging the user, we didn't want to print to our attributes test, which is going

223
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.010
to say home screen.

224
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.260
Okay, else we just want to return.

225
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:43.520
Please feel must not be empty and if the error is order from this box, we then want to say something

226
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.180
went wrong.

227
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.130
Okay?

228
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.970
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
