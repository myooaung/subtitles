00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.560
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.110
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.520
No, we are not obligated to save our users data, and this is a step.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
We are also going to save the user data in this class store database.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.250
Okay.

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.100
Now, before we set up disaster database, we are going to sign in again.

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.160
Now I want to go to my hundred hub.

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.740
Then I'm going to click on log in.

9
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.350
Okay.

10
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.960
Now we're going to wait for this is going to pop out.

11
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.240
The model was trying to show you.

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.340
Oh, yes, they did not.

13
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.720
So it is.

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.190
We have not.

15
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.270
Okay.

16
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.060
I want to pass my email.

17
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.800
So, my colleague.

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.820
Famous.

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.250
At G.M..

20
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.590
This.

21
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700
Come on, this.

22
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.610
Okay.

23
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.690
Okay.

24
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.910
I'm just going to approve this from my phone.

25
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.440
Okay.

26
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.970
Go from there.

27
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.450
Okay?

28
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.260
Yes.

29
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.240
Fortify.

30
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.690
Okay, great.

31
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.980
So you can easily just click on that more ways to site and then we'll look.

32
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.320
We can't agree.

33
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.950
Okay.

34
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.290
He's going to sign us and send.

35
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.980
They've got to redo this.

36
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.110
I just have to do to clear your hundred data in your use of the same data that to show you this from

37
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.830
scratch again.

38
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.260
Okay.

39
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.020
Now I want to click on assets.

40
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.210
Okay.

41
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.100
Okay.

42
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.520
Great.

43
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.990
Now we are currently.

44
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.460
Sign in.

45
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.460
Now I can easily go to this and come back.

46
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.170
Over here.

47
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.770
And that's a give that.

48
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.580
A refresh.

49
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.990
Okay, great.

50
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.789
Now, what I said is we are not only going to save the data over here, we are also going to be also

51
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.790
going to save the users data in this faster database.

52
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.590
We don't really want to have access to the email.

53
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.780
We also want to have access to the.

54
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.950
We also want to have access to the user.

55
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.330
And that is the display name.

56
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.760
We want to have access to the user for.

57
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.630
So that is attached to the Google account on.

58
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.470
Okay.

59
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.980
Now, unfortunately, really, we can't have access to that over here or we can't display or that way

60
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.070
because it only display the email and the user uid.

61
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.900
Okay.

62
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.770
Now.

63
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.370
We're going to go now to the faster database.

64
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.770
Okay.

65
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.720
We've just got to wait for this.

66
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.940
Okay, great.

67
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.090
We're going to click on Create Database.

68
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.920
Okay.

69
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.980
Nice asking for us to choose between the start and production.

70
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.170
Build or start and test.

71
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.780
I'm just going to go with is starts with.

72
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.200
Stop and tell us what they click on clicking like this.

73
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.640
Okay.

74
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.490
I'm going to go with the defaults and they go.

75
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.540
Okay.

76
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.710
You can see provisioning the cloud faster.

77
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.180
This is going to take some while I have a little patience for this.

78
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.310
Okay.

79
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.000
Set.

80
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.770
Now security rose.

81
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.760
Okay.

82
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.270
Almost dawn.

83
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.070
Okay.

84
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.640
Great.

85
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.280
They did not upload data over this cloud first or we need to set of some rules and then not to do that.

86
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.240
Navigate to this rule step.

87
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.960
Okay.

88
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.790
Now, yours might not look exactly like this, but whatever it is, all you have to do is to get rid.

89
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.180
So this part.

90
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.820
Delayed.

91
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.550
Delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed.

92
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.470
Gets rid of this.

93
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.269
You're going to live just to read.

94
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:17.990
Drugs.

95
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.500
So make sure you had your semicolon.

96
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.290
That's this won't allow with a write in otherwise create and.

97
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.400
Creates, I think, a fetch on what it would delete, create and order.

98
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.480
So it does what is basically we going to click on publish.

99
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.710
Okay.

100
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.040
Great.

101
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.800
Okay.

102
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.190
Now what we can have or what is data?

103
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.470
We are going to have a user coalition.

104
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.940
Okay.

105
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.190
I can just create this.

106
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.330
You're going to have a user collection where all our users are going to be stored.

107
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.230
Now each user is going to be connected to this user's collection with an I.D..

108
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.420
Over here, you can see a collection was contained at least one document.

109
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.220
What do we mean?

110
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.280
What documents they're referring to is single user.

111
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.670
So you can either call it a single user or one document clerk fast, or you need more storage documents,

112
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.280
store your data as feels.

113
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.940
Or to do that, a document ID or cluster what if you need a wallet is basically saying is you can just

114
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.870
generate a cluster of ID or click on this matter or to generate.

115
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.060
Okay now our user is going to have a user name.

116
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.070
Which is a type of drink and because it is a test.

117
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.190
And the username is going to be the user.

118
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.870
Display name, which is attached to the Google account.

119
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.890
Right.

120
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.520
So just to say.

121
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.940
My colleague.

122
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.630
Users are also going to have a photo.

123
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.950
Right.

124
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.190
You can see the image, which is going to be the user image that is attached to the Google accounts.

125
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.490
Okay.

126
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.210
So this is basically it's.

127
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.520
Now I can just get rid of.

128
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.110
I can just go ahead and save.

129
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.150
Okay.

130
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.020
Now you can see why we have this useless collection.

131
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.880
How do we have this single user, which you can refer to it as a document?

132
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.160
Now you can see the whole connection with this, this collection and this document.

133
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.240
It is.

134
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.560
What's this ID?

135
00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.910
So I using this idea to connect sports users collection together more like we are saying, we want to

136
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.720
hide this document or this single user.

137
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.310
So this collection.

138
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.820
Okay.

139
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.910
So this is also basically saying now we are not going to be creating this manually.

140
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.620
We're going to create it from code.

141
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.790
So we're going to get rid of this user's collection.

142
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.020
So delete collection.

143
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.060
Then we're going to type in.

144
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.220
They users like click on delete.

145
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.990
Okay, great.

146
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:37.160
Then in this lecture, we are going to store our data to this store database.

147
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.580
Okay?

148
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.330
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
