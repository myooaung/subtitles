00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:02.530
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.350
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.980
In this section regular displayed your uploaded videos.

4
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.340
Okay.

5
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.630
Not to do this.

6
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.420
Robin, I need to go back to Our Vinci Code.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.840
Then over the screens, they're free.

8
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.900
We're going to create a new fly, and we're going to call this fly video on this car screen.

9
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.390
Then the section dot dot.

10
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.080
And we can just see this, that, this we just for now.

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.370
And since we can change it, these are the stateful widgets and we can as well call this video screen.

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.090
Then over here we need to add light and then use control and dots in order to import the material to

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.840
that package.

14
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.260
Okay.

15
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.970
Now in and that we have access to lots of property, we can then use a scaffold widget scaffold.

16
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.480
Okay.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.810
And for now, we can have a body and a central jet which is going to set out in this widget we're going

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.380
to be using.

19
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.630
And it's going to be a test we jet.

20
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.040
And we can just see a video.

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.730
Screen.

22
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.360
Okay.

23
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.470
Now, over here, how to trigger that to get a very good format.

24
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.960
And what we can then do is go to where we have the list of pages.

25
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.210
I think we have that in the cost.

26
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.710
Fi.

27
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.540
And instead of this old page.

28
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.760
Okay.

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.840
This is going to be the sorry, the video.

30
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.380
Video, the dual screen.

31
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.870
Okay.

32
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.660
You can see it was magically imported if for any reason it did not.

33
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.110
You can't just use a light and dots control and dots import.

34
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.520
Okay.

35
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.520
Now you can use contra an s to save this.

36
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.350
Okay.

37
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
And since we are trying to change a page, we need to restart this.

38
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.360
Okay.

39
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.280
He's going to have to start in a short while.

40
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.810
Just have to be a bit patient and let you start.

41
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.510
Okay.

42
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.530
I think I got there.

43
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.460
Okay.

44
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.990
Just going to.

45
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.470
Okay.

46
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.960
Now, what we can do is we can uncheck this.

47
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.500
Right.

48
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.940
Okay.

49
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.960
I'll take that.

50
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.510
Okay.

51
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.920
Okay.

52
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.340
Okay.

53
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.150
Okay.

54
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.470
I think it's just crashed our hub from running and.

55
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.120
We're going to check this out.

56
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.310
Okay.

57
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.310
Now all we can do is.

58
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.180
Okay.

59
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.900
It did not.

60
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.200
Okay.

61
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.210
So make sure you uncheck that in it.

62
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.530
Actually, I probably did.

63
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.500
Is going to wait a while for this to see if it did not.

64
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.970
Okay.

65
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.200
Okay, okay, okay.

66
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.680
Okay.

67
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.240
I'm just gonna check this out, okay?

68
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.910
Okay.

69
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.190
Let's controller has been created.

70
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.420
What controller?

71
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.200
As we visualize, initialize and then check this out.

72
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.490
Okay.

73
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.330
I think.

74
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.840
Okay.

75
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.960
I think I have to log in.

76
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.220
Okay, great.

77
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.660
Video screen.

78
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.380
You can see this.

79
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.800
Okay.

80
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.660
Sounds good.

81
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.550
You can see over here.

82
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.740
We are currently in the home screen.

83
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.100
Right.

84
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.550
Okay.

85
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.440
Okay cause it get hot and you can see was basically going on in the half.

86
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.840
Okay.

87
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.970
Okay, guys, see you in investigation.
