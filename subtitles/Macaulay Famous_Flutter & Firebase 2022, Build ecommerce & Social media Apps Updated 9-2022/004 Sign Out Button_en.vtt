00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.589
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.640
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.590
In this lecture, we are going to create the sign out button.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.470
Okay, now to do this, what we can do is add the turn over via and then we are going to create a container

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.500
and we can give a weight to this container.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.050
That is how wide the content is going to be and we can give you a width of 140.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.410
140 And also we could give a height.

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.689
That is how long the container is going to be.

9
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.410
And we can give it a height of 47 and.

10
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.200
Then we can just go ahead and have a decoration and a box decoration.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.020
Okay.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.870
And we can give you a border.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.470
Border.

14
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.650
And this is going to be border.

15
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.450
Border the hall of maybe we can just give you a caller ID because that.

16
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.100
Lack.

17
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.180
Toys R newcomer and use controller and has to save.

18
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.900
Okay.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.810
The OC.

20
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.370
And now we can then have the child.

21
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.070
The child is going to be obsessed with that.

22
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.020
And it's just going to say a sign sign out for now at the chain of command.

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.630
Is Katrina safe and go check it out.

24
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.180
You can see it over there.

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.550
And what we could also do is give some space and can have a size sized box.

26
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.190
And we are given the space or vertically that is from top to bottom.

27
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.500
So this is going to be height, maybe heights of 15 and hydrogen newcomer.

28
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.040
In youth culture and as you say.

29
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.170
Okay.

30
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.420
You can see it over there.

31
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.070
Also we have this column.

32
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.040
We could also say cross us elements.

33
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.290
Cross us.

34
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.210
Sorry, not there.

35
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.720
I think the main column.

36
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.240
Get rid of it.

37
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.390
Where do we have that main column?

38
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.340
Why?

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.300
You can then say cross assess alignment and cross assess alignment.

40
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.390
Dot Center.

41
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.910
How did you newcomer and.

42
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.040
We could also wrap this test with that with the center, which had a mixture is in the container, so

43
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.470
it's in the center of the container.

44
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.760
So you can wrap this with the center with that and use control and save.

45
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.300
And they took it out of school.

46
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.210
And now we can start this.

47
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.380
Test.

48
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.040
Because so.

49
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.740
Test.

50
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.800
Style.

51
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.050
Okay.

52
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.040
And what we can just do is we can maybe give a font size of maybe 16.

53
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.180
And maybe it's.

54
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.540
Can't wait.

55
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.590
The board.

56
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.160
Okay.

57
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.510
And in the future we're going to make this clickable, right?

58
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.080
So what we can also do is to wrap this test widget with a button and we're just going to wrap this with

59
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.920
an inkwell.

60
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.390
But as well, you can grab this with a gesture detector.

61
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.190
And as you know, the anchor has a property known as on top.

62
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.680
And for now, it does basically nothing.

63
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.970
Okay.

64
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.200
And go check it out.

65
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.570
Cisco.
