00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.330
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.560
Worker Now is it of this for right icon.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.680
We can then have the new our watch is not to do this are going to be in the package you know that's

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.780
the house of course starting out of the box.

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.940
Okay, now I head up to your browser.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.700
Then you need to go to Park Dev and over here you're going to search for fudge or badges.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.110
Okay, you are.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.430
Which is okay.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.390
Then if you search for this, then click on this.

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.400
Then we are going to need to copy this code.

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.750
Then go to your BSE code, the pub.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.360
Spec dot yaml file.

13
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.850
Okay.

14
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.410
Then.

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.000
You give a piss.

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.720
It's because you already have it now to piss in it.

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.970
You're going to need to use control and se to save.

18
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.430
In order to get the package.

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.820
Okay.

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.220
Great.

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.960
Now, before this before this finishes, we are going to have and have over.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.380
Yeah.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.100
Okay.

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.930
So to do that, you're going to need to go to the.

25
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.510
Field.

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.560
Right.

27
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.970
Okay.

28
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.180
Can cause this.

29
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.670
And over here we can have and have our.

30
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.430
Harper.

31
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:39.760
However, and we can now the title is going to be a test get right and it's just going to say fields.

32
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.750
Screen or you can call this feature product.

33
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.190
Okay.

34
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.080
We're just going to call this Fields products.

35
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.450
Okay.

36
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.950
His culture is to save.

37
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.310
And go check what he does did.

38
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.820
Okay.

39
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.540
Now we can change the color.

40
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.390
So I've got cola.

41
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.310
Isle of Wight.

42
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.700
Okay.

43
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.490
Now there's going to be some elevation.

44
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.970
Okay we're going to make it match with the background.

45
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.220
So I going the celebration.

46
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.570
I will set it to zero.

47
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.670
Now you can see we can't actually see the test because it is white.

48
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.200
So what are going to do?

49
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.430
We can always tie.

50
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.610
And test I.

51
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.400
You can then see color colors does black.

52
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.450
Okay.

53
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.180
This an idea trying to cover.

54
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.190
Go check it out.

55
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.970
Okay.

56
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.800
Take this to the center this hour.

57
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.450
Has a property known as center tied to the center, tighter within the harbor.

58
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.940
Since I try to be able to set it to 4 hours before it's going to be at the center.

59
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.540
Okay.

60
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.230
Great.

61
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.170
Now what you're going to do next is.

62
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.140
Rebel had the new protests over air rights.

63
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.540
Okay, now we we're going to go back to our brother.

64
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.050
Then the Badghis governor screwed down.

65
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.560
Right.

66
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.630
Then why are you going to copy this code?

67
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.240
Copy.

68
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.030
From the batch to this copy.

69
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.940
Then go to the single products design first that typical products that that allow you to rename this

70
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.970
to product item.

71
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.690
Okay.

72
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.210
Now this is the position which is right now we can get rid of this container.

73
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.910
Get rid of this continent and.

74
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.640
Okay, now we can.

75
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.250
Use control and dots in order to import the package.

76
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.970
Now, if for any reason you can't have access to that probably is showing you create class it's means.

77
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.080
Your visa code X has not yet detected detected that package just add.

78
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.550
So what you can do is you can.

79
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.470
We tried to get it all.

80
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.760
You can just close your visa code and open it again.

81
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.880
Right.

82
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.370
Okay, great.

83
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.860
They are going to go back to its.

84
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.840
Also the time is always needful after you that any package you need to restart you've code.

85
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.060
That was why I did it.

86
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.870
I just said.

87
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.290
Okay.

88
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.320
Now we can use control and this to save.

89
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.510
And go check it out.

90
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.600
Okay.

91
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.240
Now we can also see.

92
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.250
Saves the ammunition, ammunition and inmates, too.

93
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.860
True.

94
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.120
So we get some kind of animation.

95
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.160
Okay.

96
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.020
I think we need to start now to see that animation.

97
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.410
Okay.

98
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.150
Sort of new batch.

99
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.170
Instead of batch, we can see new arrival.

100
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.700
Right.

101
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.560
And we can't change the color.

102
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.600
You can change the culture, whatever you want.

103
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.220
I'm just going to go with pink.

104
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.710
Okay.

105
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.230
Yeah, I can.

106
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.040
I can take this to the left so it is gonna be left.

107
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.950
Let's take this.

108
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.780
Because.

109
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.430
Get rid of this cover.

110
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.150
Most of.

111
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.950
This is zero.

112
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.170
See?

113
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.230
Okay.

114
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.320
Now, I think this is the push to the left side.

115
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.480
So that hedge we can see five.

116
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.840
Okay.

117
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.940
I think this is great.

118
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.270
Okay.

119
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.320
Now for years.

120
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.780
All right.

121
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.510
We can go to the.

122
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.740
Shields for that.

123
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.510
Control and be.

124
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.790
Then get rid of this as well.

125
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.980
You can sit inside of either the twin coma within the weights and and pest control and dogs.

126
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.190
But it's not true.

127
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.030
Effort to save.

128
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.030
It is sort of.

129
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.200
But we can't see new.

130
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.570
Right.

131
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.860
And we can also change the color to.

132
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.410
Pink or whatever you like.

133
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.870
You don't really need to go with what I'm doing.

134
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.440
Exactly.

135
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.470
You can't just go with your own design and pattern.

136
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.500
True.

137
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.210
Okay.

138
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.680
Now.

139
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.490
Go check it out.

140
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.430
Okay.

141
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.270
Great.

142
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.970
You can do it right.

143
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.810
Okay.

144
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.300
I think we have to talk.

145
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.820
Okay.

146
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.140
We're just going to go to.

147
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.450
The fields, aqueducts.

148
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.410
Okay.

149
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.170
You can see we are starting at the top.

150
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.780
We're going to get rid of this so much and get rid of this.

151
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.310
Okay.

152
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.670
I think this is okay.

153
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.650
I prefer this.

154
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.030
Okay.

155
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.000
That space.

156
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.960
We don't want space in these sites.

157
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:46.910
Right.

158
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.280
Okay.

159
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.100
Or what we can do, we can say.

160
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.740
Imagine.

161
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.210
Edge and said, I basically did it because there's so much space at the top.

162
00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.100
So it is going to be edge.

163
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.010
It's.

164
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.250
I think it says.

165
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.430
Okay.

166
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.730
I think I can spell that only.

167
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.240
Once a key space already left.

168
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.970
You can see there's five on the right.

169
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.080
Five.

170
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.620
Okay.

171
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.750
Okay.

172
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.530
Great.

173
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.289
Great.

174
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.210
Right now, we can actually take it to the left.

175
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.370
So this is all right.

176
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.890
You can see this.

177
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.360
You can just reveal.

178
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.080
Is that right?

179
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.110
Of.

180
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.650
Okay.

181
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.050
Now there's all three studies to see the animation.

182
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.700
Okay.

183
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.160
Okay.

184
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.580
Okay.

185
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.000
Okay.

186
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.450
Okay.

187
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.500
Okay.

188
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.270
I can see.

189
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.020
