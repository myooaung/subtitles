00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.830
Now, what I simply did was the roadie hop of I this is the fort up slots are the for us.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.480
Okay now the parts are going to be isn't the structure our size is known as and we see which stands

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
for models views controller.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.230
So over the slip for the rocker to create a new for the that is a which does four models over the slip.

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.170
Again we're going to create a new for the that is the V which stands for views over the lib.

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.540
Again, we're going to create a new folder that is a C which stands for controllers.

9
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.770
Okay.

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.640
Now the modus is we're all going to be creating our fields such as the username field, the password

11
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.360
field, the email field, the image field.

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.830
And so hard.

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.530
Therefore the views are going to be created.

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.630
Our You are sociais the home screen.

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.489
You are the log in, you are the sign up UI the cell screen.

16
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.040
You are also on y for the control as is.

17
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.520
There are going to be doing all our logic that created the functionality for our hub, like being able

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.730
to site of that user, been able to log in that user that created the section functionality.

19
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.300
Okay.

20
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.350
Now over these views are going to create a new folder and remember the code call for their screens.

21
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.330
They're over the screen.

22
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.500
So I will create a new for the coders, for the arts.

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.910
Okay.

24
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.920
Now, over this art, for the record, create a fly and you can call this log in for the score screen,

25
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.620
dot, dot.

26
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.760
Okay.

27
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.920
For now, we can just use this less.

28
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.340
We get to steal less.

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.970
We just call this logging screen.

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.510
Okay that over a year and we'll lose control and not import the material that that package.

31
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.880
Okay, Control and don't.

32
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.080
Okay.

33
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.280
Great.

34
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.890
Good.

35
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.770
Now what you can do is either return in a container or we can just return.

36
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.900
Probably is covered.

37
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.850
Okay.

38
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.750
So you can say, but he wanted to be sent out or to sit at the test center.

39
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.200
Okay.

40
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.040
Because the child that in the tests we did.

41
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.210
You can see probably.

42
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.430
Login screen.

43
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.450
They not so easily get rid of this or that line.

44
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.200
You can just go to our.

45
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.550
Analysis on the so-called oceans.

46
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.030
They're not going to comment this out.

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.680
Okay, great.

48
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.290
Go back to your logging screen there and just.

49
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.760
Okay.

50
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.240
Let's restart this.

51
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.180
Okay.

52
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.330
Still going?

53
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.630
I think we just have to close the code and open it again.

54
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.710
Okay.

55
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.100
Now, first of all, we're just going to check this out.

56
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.060
Okay.

57
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.780
I will go to the main, but dot fi.

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.770
Then.

59
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.150
I've got to remove all the sweat.

60
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.970
Okay.

61
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.680
Remove this.

62
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.400
Okay.

63
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.260
Now is going to remove this as well.

64
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.280
Right.

65
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.330
Okay.

66
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.100
This is going to be log in screen.

67
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.460
Right.

68
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.910
Okay.

69
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.140
Good.

70
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.050
Now control this to save.

71
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.210
Okay.

72
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.030
But check it out.

73
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.440
Okay.

74
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.760
Good luck on the screen.

75
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.640
Now what you can do, you can remove this debug banner.

76
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.630
So over here, we can see the bug.

77
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.350
Sure checks would ban is equal to four.

78
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.990
So it ought to start.

79
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.890
Okay.

80
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.790
Go check it out.

81
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.940
I think it's going to go right now.

82
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.560
Okay, great.

83
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.470
Now we're going to be using the dark mode team now to do this.

84
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.510
What we're just going to do over the.

85
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.350
There are two.

86
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.870
I just going to create a new a new fly.

87
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.430
I just got to call this cause this is a short form of constants.

88
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.690
Okay.

89
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.300

Okay.

92
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.210
Now via what we can do we can see caused.

93
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.730
Background.

94
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.800
Call your.

95
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.590
Recourse to call or.

96
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.550
Okay.

97
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.190
Kennedy is going to lose control, and that's okay.

98
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.850
But this gets rid of this.

99
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.270
Okay.

100
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.890
We're going to call the colors that you want black.

101
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.340
Okay.

102
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.310
Great.

103
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.780
Now what I want to do.

104
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.190
I want to go to our.

105
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.880
When the Dutch fly.

106
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.640
Okay.

107
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.690
Are going to remove this team data.

108
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.030
So now we're going to see a team.

109
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.560
I'm going to see a team.

110
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.510
Same day to the dock.

111
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.170
They're going can say that.

112
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.890
The copy reads.

113
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.590
Okay, so this one's these are background color.

114
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.900
So this is food.

115
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.970
Background color is the background color.

116
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.350
Look at that visible.

117
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.630
We created this over.

118
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.100
Which is assigned to the color block.

119
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.550
Okay.

120
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.740
Now I'm going to authorize this.

121
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.650
Okay, great.

122
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.900
Now you see, automatically the test becomes white.

123
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.650
Right.

124
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.270
So that's how it works.

125
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.720
Uh.

126
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.000
Okay.

127
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.100
You have to close your vehicle.

128
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.100
Then we started this red line.

129
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.750
This line over here is going to go off.

130
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.840
Right.

131
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.410
That is after you commence orders of I.

132
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.360
Okay.

133
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.710
Okay, guys, seen in this picture.
