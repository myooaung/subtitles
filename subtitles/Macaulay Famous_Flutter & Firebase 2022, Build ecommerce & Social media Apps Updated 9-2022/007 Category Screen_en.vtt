00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.230
In this lecture, we're going to start creating the screens for each category.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
Okay, now let's do this.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.420
We have to head back to our via code.

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.580
And in order to make this clean, what we can do is over this very tree.

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.940
We are going to create a new folder and we're going to call this folder cut single raise.

8
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.170
Then over these categories we are going to create a PHI and we can call this man on the score category.

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.300
On the score screen.

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.900
And then there's Textron is the dart and we can use control and B and create a stateless widget.

11
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.690
And men.

12
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.690
Man category screen.

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.060
And we have to highlight and use control in order to impart the material to that.

14
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.380
And we can just get rid of this and give it a color for now.

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.780
Colors that maybe sign.

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.820
And get rid of this liquor use control necessary and then back to the category screen.

17
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.280
And they said of this man, you can then get rid of this and core the man.

18
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.170
Main categories screen we just created.

19
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.110
Main categories screen.

20
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.320
Okay.

21
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.910
How do you turn the corner?

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.370
And we have to restart this.

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.350
Okay.

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.690
This is going to take some time and we just have to wait for this a bit.

25
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.540
And.

26
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.260
The K and now we can check it out.

27
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.200
It has to also start this app now.

28
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.750
And now he can see men's rights.

29
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.190
Okay.

30
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.500
Now we're going to continue.

31
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.690
Back to the man on the screen.

32
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.470
We can use control and B and add the chain of command to formats and instead of returning the container.

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.610
You can get rid of this.

34
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.509
And we're going to return a column a column widget.

35
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.420
And as you know, it can take multiple widgets, add your semicolon over there.

36
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.610
And the first chart is going to be a test widget, which is going to say men.

37
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.810
And we can start this.

38
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.970
We can increase.

39
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.340
Tester.

40
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.700
Right.

41
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.270
Okay.

42
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.560
Test tie and we can increase the font size.

43
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.020
To 24.

44
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.100
24.

45
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.650
Use control and save and go check this out.

46
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.820
But you can see the value.

47
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.560
And as you know, the column has a property known as cross as this element, and we can just say cross

48
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.790
as elements.

49
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.670
Don't start.

50
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.130
Okay.

51
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.590
You can see the wire and basically we can wrap this with the part in.

52
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.970
A light and use control indoors and wrapped with padding and for all sides.

53
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.830
Going to give this 25 keys control and that's a save.

54
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.530
Okay.

55
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.290
Great.

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.950
And now we are going to have another child and this child is going to be a size box.

57
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.700
Which is similar to that of the container.

58
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.250
And we basically want to give this a height and so make this responsive.

59
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.050
We can get the height of our screen media query resolve contest.

60
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.430
Then the size and the tides.

61
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.920
And remember all of it.

62
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.160
We are basically giving this entire.

63
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.000
Cats v category v 80%.

64
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.550
So what we can do, we can say we need.

65
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.720
68% by saying times zero dot.

66
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.550
0.68.

67
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.080
And as you also know, the size box has a property known as child.

68
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.370
And for the child, it's going to be this wish you've probably not seen before.

69
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.220
Greece view great view that counts.

70
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.690
The cross as count is basically referring to how many heights we need over here.

71
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.480
You're just going to see this shop and for how many items we need.

72
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.330
I'm going to say we need TV or you can increase yours to four.

73
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.660
But definitely you see what this does.

74
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.390
And the grid view that count also has the property not as cross as a space in the cross, as this space

75
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.530
is basically referring to the space we need horizontally.

76
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:54.420
And for this we can say we need maybe 15 and it also has a property known.

77
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.410
So for that.

78
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.020
Is going to get rid of that.

79
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.350
It also has a property known as a suspicion which has to do with the vertical shape.

80
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.480
And we can see we need 70.

81
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.230
Book and now it has a property known as children.

82
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.090
And what we can do, we can get rid of this bracket and we can just use it to use control and save.

83
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.020
So we get rid of that first or we can just get rid of this is as to save.

84
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.540
Okay.

85
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.000
And now it also has a property known as to drain.

86
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.530
And get rid of this.

87
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:41.650
And what we can do now is we can automatically generate some random tests, also random container.

88
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.500
To do that, we have to use this property known as list view.

89
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.460
So at least dot generate and you can see is asking for the length.

90
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.820
The length is basically referring to how many high time we want to generate for how many items we want

91
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.720
to generate.

92
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.510
I can then say maybe five, and instead of using another function, we can just use this type of function

93
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.960
and we can then return a container for now.

94
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.950
We turned the container.

95
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.360
Container.

96
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.440
And as you know, the container has a color property.

97
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.230
And for the color, as we can see, colors the sign.

98
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.140
And we're not going to see this until we give it a height, height of maybe 50.

99
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.730
That is how long it's going to be and a suite of 50.

100
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.140
Look at the size and the call and use control.

101
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.070
That's the save.

102
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.990
Then you can see we have this space, right?

103
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.080
And maybe we could just wrap this with the pardon.

104
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.830
And see.

105
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.920
Okay for all sides.

106
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.360
Okay, Casey.

107
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.770
Looking good, right?

108
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.430
Okay.

109
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.780
And finally, what we can just do.

110
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.900
We can set up the images we need for the men to do that.

111
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.920
We will go to where it is.

112
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.530
You can see it over there, man.

113
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.950
And I'm just going to copy this folder.

114
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.930
This images is going to be available to you at the resource, so go check it out.

115
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.060
And I'm going to go to the next stop and search for Morsi.

116
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.890
Vendor.

117
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.380
And assets.

118
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:38.820
You can see we already have a folder known as images and this is for our fonts.

119
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.420
This is for our phones and this is for images.

120
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.770
And we send the images.

121
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.480
We are having another folder which is referred to us app logos.

122
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.800
Okay.

123
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.460
So for that, there's the speaker.

124
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.950
And over here, we're going to paste this within the images for the right is this man.

125
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.630
Okay.

126
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.020
And now we have to tell the location of that.

127
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.120
You can see the value assets images and we have this.

128
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.020
Hopefully we paste it in the right.

129
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.590
Just know.

130
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.030
Refresh this.

131
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:22.410
And hopefully I it in the back seat of a man.

132
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.010
And now we have to tell the location of that.

133
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.520
Okay.

134
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.720
We have to head up to the polls back tomorrow.

135
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.370
Five, I think I had mistakenly called this mental that.

136
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.799
And what we can basically just do is we can duplicate this.

137
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.330
And instead of this is going to be.

138
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.810
Men.

139
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.480
Men.

140
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:58.640
And we can just add the backslash, adding the backslash float is going to go into the rest images.

141
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:06.140
So really we do not need to specify the exact location or start saying man, the jpg and so on.

142
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:14.790
So by having this backslash filter is going to know to go further into this order, into this file,

143
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:20.110
that is the main zero dot jpg menu on the jpg, right?

144
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.320
So by adding this plot, that's going to do that out of the box for you.

145
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:33.770
So in other words, we do not really need to then say main, then zero, then jpg anymore by adding

146
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.210
this box.

147
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.600
Large photo is going to know to do that and definitely we have to use control and that's the save.

148
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.730
But before that we have to make sure the path is correct.

149
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:50.060
So assets right then images then men.

150
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.690
Okay, great.

151
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.750
Now we have this control and save.

152
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.420
Save.

153
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:03.940
And you can see this greatly gets in the changes we just made to the perspective of five OC OC guys.

154
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.050
See you in the next lecture.
