00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.370
Now, when these are clicks on this, there's going to be a pop up.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.550
We have the user can choose to upload the video either from the gallery or camera, and that's all there's

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.810
going to be a cancel button.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.260
Okay.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.920
Now, to do this are going to need to go back to our VSP code and then they have the video screen.

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.400
Okay.

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.090
Now we can use control and be in that to make this wide.

10
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.480
Okay.

11
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.110
Now over here, we are going to create a function and we are going to call this function show dialog.

12
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.090
Dialogue option.

13
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.990
Okay.

14
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
Now via to pass in the contest contest.

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.150
And we can specify the type that it is a type of build contest.

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.540
Okay.

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.900
Now you're going to return something on this show.

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.590
She'll die.

19
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.610
I'll log.

20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.810
Okay.

21
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.460
I think I just have to do it again, stated the critics for me.

22
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.110
Dialogue.

23
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.970
Should dialogue.

24
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.170
Okay, great.

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.260
There you can see it has already passed in the contest.

26
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.640
Okay.

27
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.920
So via the view there is going to be contest.

28
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.820
Okay.

29
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.990
We can't ignore specifying the type.

30
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.340
Okay.

31
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.130
Now they're going to say we want to return something on a simple.

32
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.800
Simple dialogue.

33
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.910
Okay.

34
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.570
Of your cynical view, now that we're going to get rid of this and then we're going to use another function

35
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.470
and call the function we just created called Show.

36
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.260
Dialogue.

37
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.180
Option.

38
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.060
And then you're going to need a pass in this contest.

39
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.540
Okay.

40
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.530
Contest.

41
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.900
Okay.

42
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.600
Great.

43
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.120
Now use contrariness to save.

44
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.710
Okay.

45
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.330
Now click on this.

46
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.870
Okay.

47
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.870
Now, you can see he's trying to pop out something, but we don't have any chest tissue.

48
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.270
Okay.

49
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.490
So now what you're going to need to do is.

50
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.260
Over this simple dialogue.

51
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.880
This simple dialogue has.

52
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.120
The children property.

53
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.810
Okay.

54
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.690
Now for the children is going to be.

55
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.070
Simple.

56
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.560
Okay.

57
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.610
Simple.

58
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.720
Simple dialogue option.

59
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.160
Okay.

60
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.820
You can see.

61
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.330
Okay.

62
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.830
Now this is more like it.

63
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.410
But since we ask the oppressed, we can just leave the function empty for now.

64
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.700
Okay.

65
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.540
And there's all this simple dialogue option as a property known as child for the child, probably zero

66
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.980
widgets.

67
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.960
And the reason for this rule is you're going to have a test, sorry on that call, but then have an

68
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.880
icon and available to have.

69
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.600
It's just okay.

70
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.960
You're just going to see this shortly.

71
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.240
So we can't use the children.

72
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.920
The first child is going to be icon and icon.

73
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.510
We just we can use the icons dots.

74
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.490
I think image.

75
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.890
Okay.

76
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.550
And as All the Nest, we did this movie obsessed with Jets.

77
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.150
And you're just going to see Gallery.

78
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.690
Gallo.

79
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.090
Okay.

80
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.640
It's necessary.

81
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.110
Okay.

82
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.600
Now I'll click on this.

83
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.800
Okay.

84
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.410
You can see it.

85
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.050
You can see the reason why we have to use it.

86
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.560
Okay.

87
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.370
Now, what we can do is we can give space between this icon and this gallery.

88
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.600
So.

89
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.880
O'REILLY The rub.

90
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.800
This is a light for us in this country.

91
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.790
Does that rub it?

92
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.310
Pardon?

93
00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.960
Okay.

94
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.270
It's going to go with the edge.

95
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.670
This country and this is Eve and we'll check it out.

96
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.420
Click on this first to condense cases as best that we can give some strategists, because this tie is

97
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.519
going to be a chess tie.

98
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.269
You can't say font size.

99
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.530
Wonderful size to be 22.

100
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.150
Okay.

101
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.710
I think.

102
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.030
Is going to get rid of this sty.

103
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.730
Just stay.

104
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.560
Okay.

105
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.830
We want the font size to be 22 and long different font tweets.

106
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.070
So France waits to be bold so they can sue for tweets.

107
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.190
That both added true color and is contrary unnecessary.

108
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.370
Now click on this.

109
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.940
In order to get rid of that for now.

110
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.340
Okay.

111
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.230
Now click on this.

112
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.700
Okay, great.

113
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.560
There are going to have more.

114
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:19.030
So what we can then do is we can copy this simple dialog option ten create use controversy and value

115
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.310
added trigger comma.

116
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.870
And then this.

117
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.420
There's going to be a there's going to be the.

118
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.210
The tests over their.

119
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.460
You can see this is going to be I think is going to be image.

120
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.980
So for the icon first.

121
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.410
It's going to be.

122
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.740
I can't start camera.

123
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.230
Sorry.

124
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.890
Camera.

125
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.370
On the score hotline, I think Hart's hotline.

126
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.590
Okay.

127
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.950
You can use any of your choice.

128
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.710
And this is going to be camera.

129
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.540
Okay.

130
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.810
Now use this to see and go check what you just did.

131
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.770
Click on this link.

132
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.230
Lastly, we're going to have for the cancer.

133
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.570
Okay.

134
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.430
Hydrogen common and everyday is unlikely, but some just will appear.

135
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.910
There's going to be icons that console.

136
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.790
And.

137
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.890
This is going to be a council.

138
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.710
Okay.

139
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.190
Okay.

140
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.420
Click on this.

141
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.430
Okay, great.

142
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.330
Great.

143
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.830
Right.

144
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.270
Okay.

145
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.650
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
