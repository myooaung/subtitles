00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.930
Now, when they click on your heart to start is going to take us back to the log in screen and which

4
00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.310
means a user needs to log in all the time whenever they would want to use this app.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.490
You're going to see now it's going to take us back to the log in screen.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.880
Okay.

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.870
And in order to use this app again, we need to log in.

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.010
Okay.

9
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.440
Now, I think if a user would need to do this all the time, it's going to be very stressful to the

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.860
user.

11
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.370
Okay.

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.520
So what we can do is we can have some check.

13
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.900
Email the user log sane.

14
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:39.760
We then automatically save the user section and the user would not need to log in all the time until

15
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.750
they probably logged out.

16
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.500
Okay, not to do this, we're gonna need to go back to our BSA code, and the first place we're going

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.760
to go is the controller's and then the Hods controller.

18
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.610
Because this has to do with what about education?

19
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.630
Okay.

20
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.550
And now we can then use contra and V.

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.360
Okay.

22
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.910
Now you're going to do this, have the year.

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.320
Okay.

24
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.410
So sorry.

25
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.840
I thought you should be better outside your function.

26
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.330
Okay.

27
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.910
Now, to do this, you're going to need to see a string stream of music, and we can see it's going

28
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.380
to be no.

29
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.350
Then over here we're going to see get and we're going to create a rainbow card.

30
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.270
Hearts changes.

31
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.100
You're going to see this.

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.640
Show me.

33
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.110
And now we can then see.

34
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.280
Our function and memory is very hard on this cohort as everything to do with our user authentication.

35
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.920
So over here we can call the web card or this cohort.

36
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.710
Then we can see dots.

37
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.790
Hot states changes.

38
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.320
This is going to check if the user is either logged in or not.

39
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.360
So that's what this does.

40
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.090
And over here we are still storing this in a variable called hearts changes.

41
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.050
Okay.

42
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.130
Okay.

43
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.950
Now that's I says this is called hearts changes.

44
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.100
We need to first assess this hot controller class.

45
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.000
Okay.

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.350
Now you're going to need to go to you.

47
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.560
First of all, we can just use controller and that's the save.

48
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.490
And then we're going to need to go to the main thoughts that.

49
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.810
Okay.

50
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.300
There's also this luggage screen.

51
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.340
We can get rid of this for now and we can then use control and be now we're going to be using something

52
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.650
known as Stream View there.

53
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.430
Stream.

54
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.820
You there?

55
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.850
Okay.

56
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.590
What we can do is we can just bring these to the next slide.

57
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.840
And over here, we can then have the stream and the stream we need to access that holds changes to know

58
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.170
the user.

59
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.310
I see that logged in or not.

60
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.050
Okay.

61
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.520
Call the odd controller class then.

62
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.190
Thoughts?

63
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.740
What's hot changes?

64
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.520
Okay.

65
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.410
Now for the builder, this is going to take in context.

66
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.580
Contests and something known as snapshots.

67
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.700
You can see this.

68
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.180
You can see this snapshot as a rebel that has access to all of our data in the cloud faster and where

69
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.370
we can then use this type of version in our digital cover.

70
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.840
And that's all as you get a good forward in as well, which we'll cover.

71
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.830
Okay.

72
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.650
And break this.

73
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.110
Okay.

74
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.290
Now over here, we're going to check.

75
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.060
Are going to say.

76
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.760
If.

77
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.020
Eve snapshots.

78
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.550
Remember I said, you just have to see this variable as a variable that has access to all of the stars

79
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.480
in the firebase.

80
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.890
Okay.

81
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.390
We can't say you snapshots.

82
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.070
The clinician states.

83
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.650
Is it quartz you condition?

84
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.190
Connection.

85
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.850
Connection stage dot waiting.

86
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.330
That is, we are still trying to fetch the user.

87
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.050
Right.

88
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.500
Okay.

89
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.760
Probably still holding.

90
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.570
So what we can do or probably is is trying to connect to the server.

91
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.970
So what we can do is we can return.

92
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.460
Return a set of widgets to saintliness, widgets we're going to be using, and we can return something

93
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.329
known as Secular Progress Indicator Indicator, which is just a spinner.

94
00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.170
Okay.

95
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.560
You can see color colors that.

96
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.530
Black or we can just get rid of them.

97
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.260
They need to specify the color and this.

98
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.680
Okay.

99
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.170
Okay, great.

100
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.530
Now I say this, I say this.

101
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.720
If we are going to check.

102
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.390
We're going to he's in that statement as well.

103
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.940
They're going to say if snapshot.

104
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:59.430
Not as data, which means the user is currently logged in which at any era right is now showed that

105
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.350
it has data.

106
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.830
Then we want to return.

107
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.610
What?

108
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.300
The home.

109
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.910
Screen.

110
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.950
Right.

111
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.290
Okay, Hales.

112
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.270
We don't need to see Hales.

113
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.600
If this does not work, there is something below.

114
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.150
So we can just say with time.

115
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.080
What?

116
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Log in.

117
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.060
Screen.

118
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.790
Okay.

119
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.020
Great.

120
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.220
Now, this is basically it.

121
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.820
Over here we are having access to the user to know if they are logged in or not.

122
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.310
Then over year we are going to be there.

123
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.780
The reader simply means how our data is going to be rendered.

124
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.100
Over here we are passing the contents over, yet we are passing the snapshot.

125
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.770
And I said, You're going to need to see the snapshot as everybody has access to all our Firebase data.

126
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.210
Right.

127
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.260
And over here we are checking is now showed that connected to the SSC were two connected with it.

128
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.570
That is we are still trying to retrieve data.

129
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.010
Okay.

130
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.750
Rather do nothing.

131
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.020
We just want to return a circular progress indicator, which is going to be a round spinner to tell

132
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.020
the user that something is currently going on.

133
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.430
And probably we are having some network issue, but something is currently going on.

134
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.850
Okay.

135
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.500
Then over here we are seeing if the user has data, right?

136
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.550
That is no there no issues.

137
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.170
Then we want to go to the home screen house.

138
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.080
We want to go to the you know what, log in screen.

139
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.050
You know, all we can do now is order studies to see.

140
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.590
Okay.

141
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.410
You can see currently we are currently logged in.

142
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.010
Okay.

143
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.640
Okay.

144
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.080
Okay.

145
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.220
Okay.

146
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.690
Okay.

147
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.420
Okay.

148
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.410
Okay.

149
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:03.000
You can see it is not taking us back to ah the log in screen because we have data.

150
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.800
So this is the function, this is the E statement that is been caught.

151
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:17.380
We currently have data and for now, whenever I want to use this help, we don't need to log in all

152
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.440
the time and it's not going to be very stressful for us again.
