00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.900
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.750
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.710
In this lecture, we're going to create the functionality in order to enable users being able to pick

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.180
image from either their gallery or camera.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.880
Okay.

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.610
Now, in order to do this, we are going to need to go back to our vehicle and we can do this in the

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.050
auto controller file.

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.530
And what we can do, we can use control and B to make this wide.

9
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.280
Okay.

10
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.500
Now the first step is to create a function, but before then, we can have the commands and we can say.

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.530
Function.

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.890
To create Surrey function to pick.

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.500
Image from gallery or camera.

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.660
Okay?

15
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.850
And now we can create the function and we can simply call this function peak image.

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.370
Now what we can do is we can make this function reusable.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.300
And the reason for this is we are not just going to be able to pick image from just the gallery, but

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.410
as well we are going to be able to pick image from the camera.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.570
Okay.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.030
And that's to make this function reasonable over here.

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.030
We're going to pass something known as source.

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.110
The source is simply referring to how we are going to pick the image.

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.010
That is, if we are picking this image from the gallery or if we are picking this image from the camera.

24
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.140
And this is a type of something known as image source, not image shape, but image source.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.910
Okay, great.

26
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.800
And the next step is to create a label to store this package we had earlier in store.

27
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.780
That is the image picker package.

28
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.040
Okay.

29
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.430
So over here, we can create a final variable and we can just go ahead and specify.

30
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.570
This variable is a type of image picker.

31
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.380
And we can call this variable image picker and we can add another score to this.

32
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.890
And the reason for this underscore is we don't want to be able to refer to this image picker variable

33
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.540
outside this file.

34
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.290
Okay.

35
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.650
And now we can then say image.

36
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.210
Peacock.

37
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.730
Great.

38
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.370
And the next step is to use this variable called an image picker so you can see on the score image.

39
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.810
Picture Dot's peak image.

40
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.160
That spooky image I remember the source is basically referring to how are going to be able to pick this

41
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.670
image.

42
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.660
That is, if we are picking this image from the gallery or the camera.

43
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.530
This is the same thing as this surveyor.

44
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.700
I could have said Dot pick image and you can see.

45
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.860
And for the source, we can then say image source.

46
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.200
That's GALLOWAY Right.

47
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.020
But we are making this visible.

48
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.530
So whenever we call this function, we are going to need to pass the value to the source.

49
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.850
Okay.

50
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.680
Add your semi-colon over here and we can store the result.

51
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.930
That is the pict image in the variable.

52
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.110
We can store the result in a variable called PHI.

53
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.920
And this is a type of something known as SE or ox fei.

54
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.990
Okay.

55
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.820
That's going to take some time in order to open the gallery and in the to pick the image.

56
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.100
It's also going to take some time in order to open the camera and in order to pick the image or to snap

57
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.240
from the camera.

58
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.110
Right.

59
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.530
So we have to tell a floater that we are ready to wait for this.

60
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.430
So here we're going to use the weight that's easily out of here.

61
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.460
We have to use the async way and now we can say, wait.

62
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.990
Okay, great.

63
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.790
Now we're going to have this error.

64
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.350
So over here we can say it can be no, there isn't for this, nor is.

65
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.000
Imagine if the user should open the gallery and refuses to pick an image.

66
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.380
So it's going to be no right.

67
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.840
So we have to tell floater.

68
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.230
It can be not.

69
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.550
Okay.

70
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.780
And now we're going to do some check before we finally pick the image.

71
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.230
So over here we can create an E statement.

72
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.700
We can also make this variable private.

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.830
So we want to be able to assess this variable as satisfied so that let's make it private.

74
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.450
We can just use the underscore.

75
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.530
And we can say on the score, fi.

76
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.520
Is not equal to, nor if it is not equal to, nor that means the user of successfully picked an image.

77
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.700
Then it wants to return.

78
00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.460
Something on us on the score of five that is Israel first and we can have access to the read ad with

79
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.510
us bites.

80
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.730
LS if the user opens the gallery and refuses to pick an image for the now we just want to print something

81
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.360
to ourselves which is just going to say no image selected.

82
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.900
Hopefully I can spare selected.

83
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.990
Okay, great.

84
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.900
This is basically all we need.

85
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.510
First of all, we created.

86
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.900
A function which we called peak image, and we passed in a dynamic variable called source.

87
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.130
Right.

88
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.380
And it is a type of image source.

89
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.180
And the reason for this is whenever we call this peak image, we are going to need to pass the value

90
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.470
to this for now.

91
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.600
It is just a variable, right?

92
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.880
So we're going to need to pass the value to it.

93
00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.360
And the value is going to be if we are picking from the gallery or if we are picking from the camera.

94
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.800
Right.

95
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.970
And over here.

96
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.770
Whereby the source is basically referring to the gallery or camera.

97
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.310
Right.

98
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:16.750
And we are we restore the PICT image in a variable called file and we are basically checking if the

99
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.750
user actually picked the image that we want to return.

100
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.870
Read us bytes or else if the user.

101
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.720
Did not speak the image for the now we just want to print this to ourselves.

102
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.230
Okay.

103
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.840
So this is basically it.

104
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:36.980
So in this lecture, we are going to be able to call this function and then pass the value to series.

105
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.650
Okay.

106
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.330
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
