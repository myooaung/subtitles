00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.600
Now, what we are going to do in this lecture is immediately a user had a product to their cards.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.990
We want to display a batch over here and the total number of item the user has added to their cards.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.310
To do this, first of all, we have to scroll down.

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.950
Scroll down.

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:38.390
Where we have this button on the shopping cart icon and we are going to wrap this icon with a widget

8
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.920
and this widget is going to be a badge, badge and use control and save and go see it now.

9
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.570
Okay.

10
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.330
Okay.

11
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.810
Okay, great.

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.400
Now, currently we have this badge, and even if we do not have any products added to our cards, we

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.360
are still going to have this badge.

14
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:09.900
So what we can do is we can check if we don't have any product added to our cards, then no need to

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.610
show any badge or via.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.790
To do this, the badge has a property known as show badge.

17
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.660
And over here we can then call the provider.

18
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.850
Provider, lots of contests and we have to specify it is a type of cards provider.

19
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.320
And those get items.

20
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.170
And now we have to say that is empty.

21
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.560
If it is empty, we then want to.

22
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.190
Set it to false.

23
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.930
For us else we want to set it to.

24
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.590
True.

25
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.740
True.

26
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.270
True is control and has to save and go check it out.

27
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.200
Okay.

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.340
And you can see you you can still see this badge.

29
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.870
And the reason for this is we have a product in our cards.

30
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.340
Okay, great.

31
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.060
And also within the budget, it has a property known as badge collar.

32
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.380
And this is going to be close.

33
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.310
The sign is necessary.

34
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.620
Great, great, great, great.

35
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.230
Okay, great.

36
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.760
And what we can then do is we can display the total number of item we have had.

37
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.900
That's our cards.

38
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.420
To do this within the badge, it has a property known as badge content.

39
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.330
And this is going to take in excess widgets.

40
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.210
And since this is it says widgets, we can say card provider dot counts.

41
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.840
Right.

42
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.910
And you can see we are not within the we do not have access to that card provider.

43
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.880
Right.

44
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.530
Okay.

45
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.980
So what we can then do is, again, we can call the provider.

46
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.860
Provider.

47
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.630
Dot.

48
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.500
Of contest and the oath.

49
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.570
Sorry, we have to specify.

50
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.890
It is a type of word card provider.

51
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.590
And this is going to be the ticket items and the length to get the total number of items.

52
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.640
We have had that to our cards.

53
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.770
And since this is a number, we have to convert it to a string OC use controller and has to save this

54
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.280
now.

55
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.080
Okay.

56
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.880
And.

57
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.820
Okay, great.

58
00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.250
Now you can see currently we are not saying any listing to false and the reason for this is because

59
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.100
we are within the widget tree.

60
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.700
Right.

61
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.600
So currently it is saying this provider as a widget.

62
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.460
Right.

63
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.710
The reason we have to set list in is because we are outside the widget tree.

64
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.180
You can see this is we are within the function and this is not a widget.

65
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.850
So we have to set listing to force.

66
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.180
Right.

67
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.530
Okay, great.

68
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.080
And in the future, you are fully going to see the reason why we are setting into force and back to

69
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.740
this.

70
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.100
We could also.

71
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.520
Consequently, we have one item and we could start the test.

72
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.600
And.

73
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.650
Okay.

74
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.630
It ends so we can just add a newcomer and have a star and.

75
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.530
It says.

76
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.280
Style.

77
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.500
We can just change the color to maybe colors don't.

78
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.570
What, maybe font size.

79
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.830
To be 16.

80
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.850
In front with.

81
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.090
Phones with the doors at the chain of command.

82
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.730
Okay.

83
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.710
Okay, okay.

84
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.570
Sims Cool.

85
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.570
And let's have another product and this hard.

86
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.260
Okay.

87
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.130
You can see now two K and let's add another.

88
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:51.960
In this, you can see three walk in and what we can just do is we can change this button to sign as

89
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.290
well.

90
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.090
Okay, touch screen.

91
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.880
Touch screen and scroll down.

92
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.850
Okay.

93
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.790
I am going to change this to change it to sign.

94
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.460
Color is a sign.

95
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.280
So every color is going to match with our app.

96
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.140
Use control and save.

97
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.720
And go check this out.

98
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.930
Okay.

99
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.300
Okay, great.

100
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.230
Looking very nice.

101
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.640
And let's go hard.

102
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.750
Another product.

103
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.590
And I believe we already have that in our card.

104
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.750
And I'm just going to hard on that product to make it for item we have in our card.

105
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.360
Okay.

106
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.790
Great.

107
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.890
Okay, this is it.

108
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.940
And if we don't understand anything, please do well to let me know.

109
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:57.510
And I'm going to make a video specially for you in order to make it more understandable to you.

110
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.100
Okay.

111
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.090
Okay, guys.

112
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.440
See you in the next lecture.
