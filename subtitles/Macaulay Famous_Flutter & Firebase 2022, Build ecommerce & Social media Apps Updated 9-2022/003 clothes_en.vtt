00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.880
Walker In this lecture, we're going to create the fields for each product.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.240
That is the image, the prize, the name of the products and orders.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.560
Not to do this document needs to go back to our previous code.

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.610
We all agreed that the models for the economy we were going to create in all our fields.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.000
Right.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.410
Okay.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.030
So now what we can do is over this model directory, we can create a new fly and we can call this fly

9
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.140
clause.

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.360
Then this section wishes.

11
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.050
Dot, dot.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.990
Then we can use control and B to make this white that the first step we're going to take is you are

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.400
going to create a class and you're going to call this class.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.400
Close.

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.570
Okay.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.220
Now, for the now retired generals or thick clothes, what's their future?

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.550
The products are going to be coming from near the fireplace.

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.580
For the now, we can just have some quick clothes products.

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.210
Okay.

20
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.170
Now, the first field we need is the name of the product, right?

21
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.880
We can just call this tie two.

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.650
Well, you can simply call your name or product name.

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
Or we can just go ahead and call this product's name.

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.020
Okay.

25
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.380
Great.

26
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.760
Now, this is a test.

27
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.850
So it is a type of string.

28
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.420
Right.

29
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.560
We can't allow the question of up to this.

30
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.340
That's.

31
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.250
We don't want it to be required, actually.

32
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.360
Okay.

33
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.420
Now, the less we need is.

34
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.430
The price.

35
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.870
You can go with this drink for now because it is the type of string for now.

36
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.570
So there's going to be a price.

37
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.380
Okay, then we need.

38
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.280
The image.

39
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.640
Right.

40
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.060
Okay.

41
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460
Staying right is going to be you can call this image.

42
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.780
You are real.

43
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.960
Okay.

44
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.240
Add your question up to this.

45
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.170
Okay now what's up with the junior is struggling to generate his schools I to look before they need

46
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.710
to pass this item so the close quote structure so to do that they're going to say close.

47
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.380
Then your parenthesis over it is going to be this dust product name over.

48
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.240
This dirt cries over and this.

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.140
That's immaterial.

50
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.330
Okay.

51
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.830
Can I just try to cover on this?

52
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.240
Okay.

53
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.430
Now we are going to generate.

54
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.950
Close.

55
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.450
So you're going to generate for the right.

56
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.660
Okay.

57
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.610
Not to do that but via.

58
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.430
Is static.

59
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.250
Then there's going to be lists.

60
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.160
List or close that clothes class.

61
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.520
Okay.

62
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.700
They're a little creative.

63
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.990
We will call generate.

64
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.120
You going to see this shirt?

65
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.490
They generate clothes.

66
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.540
Right.

67
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.480
They were able to pass out franchises and then this.

68
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.460
Okay.

69
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.500
Generate close.

70
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.800
Now we can return.

71
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.320
A list.

72
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.260
A list of quotes so that we can then call this clause.

73
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.060
So there's going to be quite a squad.

74
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.330
Close.

75
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.220
Okay, great.

76
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.690
Like I said, wants us to pass all this.

77
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.060
It wants us to pass the product name.

78
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.220
It wants us to pass the price.

79
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.840
And it also supplies the images.

80
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.840
All right.

81
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.330
So now, first of all, I'm just going to had.

82
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.730
It's a great day for the product name.

83
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.620
Just fix it straight.

84
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.980
Right.

85
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.630
So there's going to be.

86
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.310
There's going to be, you see.

87
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.990
For now.

88
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.710
We'll see.

89
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.960
Over.

90
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.240
Size, the canvas size and for the price we can.

91
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.010
We also made it this way.

92
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.810
A future is going to be a double.

93
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.460
Okay.

94
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.140
But now you can see.

95
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.830
You can use the backslash.

96
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.940
In other forces, Ebola.

97
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.440
Then you can see 77 to 39 I.

98
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.690
Okay.

99
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.690
For the images url.

100
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.390
It's going to be assets.

101
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.360
Slush.

102
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.520
They're just going to check if we have individual analysis.

103
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.670
Images.

104
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.640
Okay, we have there are over one.

105
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.280
The images are going to be available to you.

106
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.780
Okay.

107
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.930
There's going to be.

108
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.910
The images.

109
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.750
Then Flash.

110
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.290
What, Arriva?

111
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.290
One third P and G.

112
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.270
Right.

113
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.700
Okay.

114
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.220
And our kids got to be okay.

115
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.760
You can then use control, I guess, to save grades.

116
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.810
Now we have what products?

117
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.220
Right.

118
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.130
So what you can then do is we can.

119
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.590
Yes, we can.

120
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.420
Cofidis.

121
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.680
Right.

122
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.450
And test this.

123
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.780
The prize for this is going to be.

124
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.990
$89 and a set of zero one to use the arriver to.

125
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.780
And.

126
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.930
We're going to just call this.

127
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.470
They call this product.

128
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.870
Oh, see, Dash.

129
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.850
--.

130
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.530
Of our size.

131
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.190
Okay.

132
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.770
Great.

133
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.040
Right.

134
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.730
I did shoot a couple of.

135
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.920
It's a very good forward.

136
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.920
They're trying to get a good format.

137
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.100
Okay.

138
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.310
Grace is controlling this tape.

139
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.700
Okay.

140
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.530
Although, yeah, we generated we we created the fields we need.

141
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.670
We need the product name.

142
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.790
We need the price, we need the image URL to be able to use this fields we just created, we pass it

143
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.980
on to the constructor, right?

144
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.960
So whenever I would call this close in any, in any of all the files to be able to fill to this fields,

145
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.020
that was the reason we have to pass it on to the constructor.

146
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.680
And over here we are generating a list of calls.

147
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.160
Right.

148
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.040
We are for the now we have just to close that is to super size on this price which is $70 to and the

149
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.540
assets that is the image.

150
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.950
And over here we have a w l products which is t shirt of a size and the price, which is 80 to $99 for

151
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.560
the image.

152
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.920
Right.

153
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.720
So for now, we have just two products and 40.

154
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.480
Now we are generating this item.

155
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.060
This product locally, right?

156
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.220
In the future, your products is going to come from our base and not from our.

157
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.710
Not from our model.

158
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.890
Secretary Rice is getting a call from the firebase.

159
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.100
We can then upload for that and it's going to be visible.

160
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.260
Just that this is going to be visible horizontally.

161
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.510
That's a sequence crew that is also subsequently visible at the fields.

162
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.000
So when you click on this fields, you're going to see varieties of lots of products.

163
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.320
Okay.

164
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.940
Okay, guys.

165
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.560
See, you did this lecture.
