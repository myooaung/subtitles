00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.569
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:02.469
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:08.260
In this lecture, we're going to integrate Firebase, but before then, we're going to have some request

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.720
packages we need in order to use Firebase.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.670
So head up to your browser and head up to pub dot dev.

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.360
And over here we're going to have some required packages we need.

7
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.870
Now, one of the packages we need is Firebase Core.

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.700
Okay.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.380
We can click on this first thing over here.

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.260
But before then you can basically see what it does.

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.690
Flutter plugin for Firebase Core Enabling Connecting to multiple Firebase Apps.

12
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.130
But in the future, you're going to see the fullness of this.

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.910
Click on this first thing over here, and we need to copy this code and head back to our voice code

14
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.790
and then post back that YAML file and we're going to paste this right after the Cupertino icons we don't

15
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.940
really need to save since we are going to have some more so we can go back and click on this pop.

16
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.260
The dev and the other package we're going to be needed is the Firebase Heart's.

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840
For authentication, you can basically say What does Flutter plugin for Firebase?

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.480
Enabling Android and Hours authentication using password.

19
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.820
Phone numbers and identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter so we can click on this Firebase

20
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.170
or First Link.

21
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.630
As well.

22
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.320
You're going to see the fullness of what this does in the future.

23
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.480
So we can copy this.

24
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.290
And pays this.

25
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.160
Sorry.

26
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.160
Pays this OC.

27
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000
And click on this again.

28
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.690
Okay.

29
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.620
For sure.

30
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.830
We're going to have all our data saved.

31
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.380
Right?

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.290
So we need this package called cloud faster.

33
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.730
And you can see what does flutter plugin for cloud first or a cloud or stat and you can just redirect

34
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.330
yourself.

35
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.220
So we can't copy this.

36
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.640
And is this okay?

37
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.160
And as you know, we are going to store all of our images.

38
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.540
That is the user images, the product images.

39
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.610
So for this purpose, we're going to need to install a package known as Firebase.

40
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.270
Firebase.

41
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.720
Firebase Store.

42
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.790
Okay.

43
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.290
That is fab storage.

44
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.080
Okay, I think.

45
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.650
We have something.

46
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.820
Fobister.

47
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.640
Well, I think it's called Firebase Firebase Storage.

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.320
Firebase Storage.

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.710
Hopefully.

50
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.270
Okay.

51
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.780
I'm just going to search for this.

52
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.080
Okay.

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.440
Firebase Storage.

54
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.540
So we can click on this.

55
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.420
And.

56
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.900
Had this.

57
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.010
Okay.

58
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.830
So now we can use concur and save in order to get all these packages we just added.

59
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.700
Okay.

60
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.610
While it is running, we can then integrate Firebase.

61
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.890
Okay, so now over here, we'll put a new tab and we're going to search for.

62
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.890
Firebase.

63
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.810
Firebase.

64
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.970
And we can go to this first link or via the firebase dot google dot com.

65
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.230
Click on this first link.

66
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.600
Okay.

67
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.170
If for any reason you don't have an account, you can easily just create one and click on.

68
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.650
Console.

69
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.100
Go to console.

70
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.480
Sorry.

71
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.000
Okay.

72
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.440
Go to the console.

73
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.660
Okay.

74
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.960
I think I'm having a bit slow.

75
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.770
Let's network.

76
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.310
Okay.

77
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.630
We just have to wait for this and check what we have.

78
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.450
Okay.

79
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.970
Still running.

80
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.520
Okay.

81
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.910
So now what are we going to need to do is we're going to click on had projects.

82
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:21.740
Hard projects.

83
00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.750
Now you can see it's asking for the project name.

84
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.240
We can call this multi.

85
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.020
We'll see whether you can call this whatsoever desire.

86
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.800
But whether.

87
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.490
And we can click on, we confirm ourselves, then click on Continue.

88
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.400
And make sure you disable this.

89
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.430
We don't really need it and create projects.

90
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.550
This is going to take some time and.

91
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.120
Okay.

92
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.930
Okay.

93
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.080
Provisioning resources.

94
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.180
And.

95
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.450
Finishing up.

96
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.010
Okay.

97
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.530
Now we can click on Continue.

98
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.660
And they're going to be integrating for Android so we can click on Android.

99
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.860
Because he's asking for the Android package name.

100
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.420
And if you want this, you can see where the location is.

101
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.060
Your package name is generally the application ID in your app level.

102
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.380
Build that gradle file.

103
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.780
So we can go back to our vehicle.

104
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.650
This is done.

105
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.550
Okay.

106
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.710
And the harp level.

107
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.600
This is.

108
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.580
Okay.

109
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.980
We can just collapse of this.

110
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.740
And hundred.

111
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.650
And happily reputed cradle.

112
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.640
Okay.

113
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.280
So this is the app.

114
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.770
This is the level integrator.

115
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.730
Okay, it should be, yeah.

116
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.950
Okay.

117
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.580
This is the application ID.

118
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.740
But what we can do is we can make this a bit unique by using our own name.

119
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.030
So over here, we can just use our name.

120
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.780
I can say Mark CLI.

121
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.770
Again.

122
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.870
We're just going to use my name, my colleague.

123
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.050
Famous.

124
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.340
Okay.

125
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.970
You can't use your name over here.

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.480
Okay, so what we can then do is we can copy this.

127
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.650
Copy.

128
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.250
And.

129
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.590
Paste it over here for the app nickname because it's not really necessary.

130
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.530
Or you can just say Multi-vendor as well.

131
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.480
Multi-vendor and just click on Continue.

132
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.850
You basically need this two for four to integrate Google so you can just click on Register App.

133
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.340
Okay.

134
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.600
Och.

135
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.440
Och.

136
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.980
This is taking longer than expected.

137
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.370
Okay, great.

138
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.570
So now what we have to do is to click on this, to download this download.

139
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.270
Download.

140
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.680
Downloading.

141
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.120
Because, Don, I'm just going to hold my.

142
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.600
My phys.

143
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.380
Okay.

144
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.280
Okay, okay.

145
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.080
Sorry.

146
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.480
I think this is taking a bit longer.

147
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.370
Okay, it's done.

148
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.810
Okay.

149
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.220
We can then go to downloads.

150
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.100
That.

151
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.890
Loads.

152
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.310
Okay, this is it over here.

153
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.600
We can cut it.

154
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.380
And go to Dexter.

155
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.430
What the vendor I can.

156
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.830
I have a lot of projects I can just search through.

157
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.040
Okay, this is it.

158
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.830
So we are going to need space.

159
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.220
This is the android.

160
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.670
Then within the app level, like the app level, where we have this Z and this.

161
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.590
So we can then paste this over here.

162
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.770
So now we can click on Nest.

163
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.150
So now this is what is asking for.

164
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:24.550
He says the the perfect level that Guido is asking us to add this line, this line of here to the project

165
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.780
level, Guido.

166
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.370
So what we can do, we can copy this and head back to vs code.

167
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.240
Sorry.

168
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.460
We need control and save this file.

169
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.530
Okay.

170
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.200
This should be this is the half level.

171
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.679
Be the widow and this should be the project.

172
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.580
The project level be the widow.

173
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.280
And in order to basically know.

174
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.680
Okay.

175
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.300
Project level.

176
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.760
This is the app level.

177
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:51.790
Okay.

178
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.550
I think we should check.

179
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.590
Okay.

180
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.660
Project level B that Guido.

181
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.010
Like project level B that grader.

182
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.020
This is the project level for sure.

183
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.670
And they're going to need to have this.

184
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.740
We send the class.

185
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.640
We can basically just know we have to have this since this class is here.

186
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.310
So definitely we going to need to have this here.

187
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.730
So this is the project level we can use containers to save again.

188
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.380
Okay, now.

189
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.570
Screw down.

190
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.010
That is all earbuds this year.

191
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:34.870
So we need to go down and you can see it wants us to have this other line and it wants us to add it

192
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.690
to the half level bullet griddle.

193
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.350
So we need to copy this.

194
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.150
And head back to the top level.

195
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.870
This is the top level and this is the b the griddle and.

196
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.340
Within here.

197
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.860
You can you can see we still have this apply plugin.

198
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.590
So in case you forget, you should be able to track with this apply plugin we have so we can paste this

199
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.320
over here as well and it's and save.

200
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.430
Okay.

201
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:07.570
Lastly, we're going to need to have this implementation and it is it is the same directory that is

202
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.500
the hub level.

203
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.140
So we can copy this and.

204
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.880
Scroll down to the implementations.

205
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.590
Okay, great.

206
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.340
Now what we can also do the minimum SDK.

207
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.300
We are going to need to increase it to 21.

208
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.620
Take the for the sensor lighting also.

209
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.990
But we just have to increase the.

210
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.780
Make sure you get rid of this.

211
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.400
And use 21.

212
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.630
So we're basically increasing the minimum SDK version to 21.

213
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:48.710
I can use control and save and this is basically all you need to do in order to integrate Firebase.

214
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.460
So make sure you stop your app from running if it's already running and you're good to go.

215
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.670
So now we need to click on Nest.

216
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.110
Okay.

217
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.580
Continue to console.

218
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.360
Okay.

219
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.040
This is all.

220
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.870
So by doing this, we have fully integrated firebase.

221
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.090
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
