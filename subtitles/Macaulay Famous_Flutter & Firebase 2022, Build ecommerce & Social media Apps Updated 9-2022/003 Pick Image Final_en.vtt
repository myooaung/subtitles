00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.590
Hey, Walker, in this lecture, we are finally going to be able to pick image either from the gallery

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.320
or from the camera.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.700
Okay, then let's do this.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.820
We're going to need to go back to our via record and then the London customer screen.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.720
And what we can do, we can use control and beat the mic this wide.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.350
Okay.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.440
Now I know that you have a much more clean record.

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.330
We're going to need to create a function just the same way we did for this sign up.

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.500
So over a year, we're going to first create a function in a that's a peak image from the gallery.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.490
So we can call this function peak.

11
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.200
Image from.

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.300
From Gallery.

13
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.120
Okay.

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.510
And now we're going to need access to this reusable function we have over.

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.440
And in order to have access to this reusable function, we first need to have access to this controller

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.630
class because this function is within the class.

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.560
Okay.

18
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.980
Now, over here, we already have the function.

19
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.390
Sorry, we already have the class imported and we basically save the results in a variable called on

20
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.170
the score horse controller.

21
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.780
Okay.

22
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.480
So now what we can do is over here, we can then call the underscore or it's.

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.960
Underscore Odds controller and we can then have assets to that function.

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.370
So we can say dot peak image.

25
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.770
Okay, now you can see it's asking for the value.

26
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.410
Remember over here we had passed in a dynamic variable called source and over here is asking for the

27
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.880
value to that variable.

28
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.570
Okay.

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.260
So for this, this is going to be a major source.

30
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.930
Dark Arts Gallery.

31
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.710
So we're going to be able to pick image now from the gallery.

32
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.320
So you can just had a semicolon over here.

33
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.960
And what we can then do now is we can store the image in a variable.

34
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.160
We can store it available card image or we can just say I am, which is the short form of image and

35
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.150
equal to.

36
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.680
And this is a type of something known as you.

37
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.590
Ain't.

38
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.960
Most of the time, you just have to memorize all this process.

39
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.880
You're in eight lists.

40
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.460
Sorry, eight.

41
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.110
Make sure you don't go with the system, but eight.

42
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.800
Okay.

43
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.210
And after we pick an image, we're going to need to display the image over here.

44
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.570
So basically, we're going to need to update the UI to something that's and in order to update the UI,

45
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.700
we have to set state.

46
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.040
So over here we can then say set.

47
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.410
States and we can store the pigs image in the global variable.

48
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.020
So all we can do is over here.

49
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.540
We can create a global variable which we are going to call underscore image.

50
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.670
And this is the type of you.

51
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.440
Ain't.

52
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.640
Its nature is not sustained.

53
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.770
But it's.

54
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.780
At least.

55
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.470
Okay.

56
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.360
And we can say it can be nor.

57
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.800
Now over here we can then Korda on the score image that is the global variable and we can see it's going

58
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.500
to be equal to this variable or via.

59
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.490
Okay.

60
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.310
This country needs to save.

61
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.160
And now we can call this function.

62
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.650
So we have that over.

63
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.820
This is for the camera.

64
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.870
And this should be.

65
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.870
The camera.

66
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.980
And this is okay.

67
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.750
This is for the gallery.

68
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.050
Right.

69
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.560
Okay.

70
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.470
So over here, we can then cover the story.

71
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.460
Peak.

72
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.780
Image from gallery.

73
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.860
Okay, now we start this.

74
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.030
Ports starting.

75
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.060
Okay.

76
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.160
We just have to wait.

77
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.230
Okay.

78
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.080
And.

79
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.220
And now we can try this.

80
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.980
Okay.

81
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.260
Click on this.

82
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.970
You can see now the gallery is open.

83
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.150
If you don't have any image, all you just have to do is to go to where you have your pictures.

84
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.900
And you can just drag this and.

85
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.030
Howard is over here and you're going to see it in the loads.

86
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.850
You might not see it in every sense, but you're going to see it in the downloads.

87
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.090
Okay, so now we can pick this image.

88
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.200
Okay.

89
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.510
Now, what we want to do is we want to be able to display the image over here.

90
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.400
And remember, over here, this variable called Higham.

91
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.990
Has the value of whatever the user picked.

92
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.780
And over here we created a global variable.

93
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.170
And you can see we are using this global variable and we are basically assigning this value to the global

94
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.860
variable.

95
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.680
Right.

96
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.300
Okay.

97
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.140
So over the Sequoia avatar, we're going to do some check.

98
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.260
So over here we can say if image.

99
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.210
Sorry, underscore.

100
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.660
Image.

101
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.910
Words.

102
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.080
So.

103
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.790
No, Dorrit, what am I doing?

104
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.280
Okay.

105
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.750
On the score.

106
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.360
Image is not a score so.

107
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.160
Nor if it is not equal to.

108
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.070
Nor it means the user speaks an image.

109
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.580
Right.

110
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.390
Then we are not going to return the square.

111
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.560
But what we can just do.

112
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.120
We can just copy this.

113
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.890
Copy this, and this is going to be for the spouse.

114
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.590
Okay.

115
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.170
So if it is not equal to know, what we want to do is.

116
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.010
Over it, this background.

117
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.520
We are basically written in a background color.

118
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.930
So if it is not equal to no, that is if the user has successfully picked an image, the circle avatar

119
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.510
has something known as background image.

120
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.220
And for the background image there's something known as memory.

121
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.880
Memory image, and now we can call that global variable, which is scored on the score image and we

122
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.200
can see it can be more.

123
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.850
Okay, great.

124
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.250
So if it is not equal to no, which means the user has actually picked an image.

125
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.280
So we're going to return a Sequoia avatar which has the background image.

126
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.680
Else.

127
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.900
We just want to return a square water with just the background color.

128
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.190
Okay.

129
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.850
So we can ask what we can just do.

130
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.570
We can start this.

131
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.390
But we started.

132
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.750
Okay.

133
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.790
Pick this.

134
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.890
Nothing happens.

135
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.830
What we can.

136
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.560
What we have to do is.

137
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.300
This will always take some time.

138
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.890
So we have to await it.

139
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.510
And in order to use it weight, we have to use the async of a.

140
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.090
And how it.

141
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.690
Okay.

142
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.200
Now we start.

143
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.790
Or it's restarting.

144
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.060
Sorry.

145
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.580
Okay.

146
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.310
Okay.

147
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.870
If I'm allowed to start.

148
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.990
Okay.

149
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.550
Now we can try to peek and the image.

150
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.800
Ticketmaster or to start this app.

151
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.390
Okay.

152
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.020
And pick this.

153
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.240
Okay.

154
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.450
You can see Tovia.

155
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.580
Okay.

156
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.570
Pick this.

157
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.400
Okay.

158
00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:46.110
Remember, we made this dynamic so we can just copy this.

159
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.090
So copy this function.

160
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.950
And.

161
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.530
This is going to be peak image from.

162
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.420
Camera.

163
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.500
Right.

164
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.600
And now we can change the source to.

165
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.790
Towards camera.

166
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.750
And what we have to do is to core the function.

167
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.680
Okay.

168
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.940
We have that.

169
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.360
Over.

170
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.090
Over a year.

171
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.100
So this is going to be peak image.

172
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.170
From camera.

173
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.850
Okay.

174
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.840
Now we start.

175
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.500
And we're going to be able to pick image now from the camera and from the gallery.

176
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.480
Okay.

177
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.890
What we started.

178
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.600
Okay.

179
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.700
Click on camera.

180
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.730
There's no opening up the camera.

181
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.950
Okay.

182
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.940
Okay.

183
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.270
Working as expected.

184
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.450
We just have to wait for the camera because it's taking some time.

185
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.110
And that was why we have to wait for it.

186
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.410
Okay.

187
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.100
Allow.

188
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.210
Okay.

189
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.410
And next.

190
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.140
Okay.

191
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.850
Okay.

192
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.470
Go, go, go.

193
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.570
And I'm just going to go sit.

194
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.280
And this is okay.

195
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.630
I've snapped and.

196
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.260
Okay.

197
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.890
This is.

198
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.270
It sounds good, right?

199
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:42.960
Okay.

200
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.820
Okay, guys.

201
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.470
See you in the next lecture.
