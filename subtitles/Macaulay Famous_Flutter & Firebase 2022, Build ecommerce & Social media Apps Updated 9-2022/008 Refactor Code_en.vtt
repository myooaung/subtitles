00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.320
In this lecture, you're going to need a lot.

4
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.610
So we use widgets.

5
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.920
Now, what we're going to do first is over here, we're going to have a divider.

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.200
And at the middle, we are going to have a test which is going to say account settings.

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.980
And then over here we're going to have a divider as well.

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.290
Now, with my explanation, you can see it's going to look similar to what we have over here.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.770
So what we can do is we can make this reusable.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.300
Okay?

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.690
To do this, we're going to need to go back to our VTS code.

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.520
Now you can see we have this row of widgets and the reason for this row is because we want to display

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.650
these three main widgets horizontally that is from left to right.

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.450
And you can see we basically have the the first divider, which is what you say over here, the test,

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:02.490
which is what you see over here, and the last divider, which is what you see over here.

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.120
Okay.

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.740
So what we can now do is we can alight and we're going to go to the extract widgets.

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.130
Okay.

19
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.680
Now we're going to call this repeated.

20
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.650
Pete said, make sure it is a capital letter since it is a class repeated.

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.170
Pete said the further click on Enter and you can see it obvious what we can do and copy that and you

22
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.540
can see it is created below this.

23
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.980
And right after the pardon the remember the pardon is basically for this container and we are basically

24
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.540
using the pardon to wrap the container.

25
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.380
Hope you know that to have this space within the hedges.

26
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.100
So we're going to paste this right after the pardon before then we need a chain of command and we can

27
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.180
then pass this.

28
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.760
We can use control and that's to save over there.

29
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.090
Okay.

30
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.220
You're going to see the value.

31
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.160
Okay.

32
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.300
Now, the issue is it has the same details.

33
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.090
That is, the account is for account info.

34
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.130
Now what we can then do is we can make this dynamic to do that within the created within the created

35
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:21.560
repeated divider, we're going to create a final variable and we're going to call this title and.

36
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.330
It is a test.

37
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.860
So this is the type of string.

38
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.310
In the value we can then say required.

39
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.450
And the reason for this required is we are saying anytime we call this title, we need to pass a value

40
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.350
to it.

41
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.710
Okay.

42
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.410
So this is going to be this.

43
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.810
This does tie to how do you recover and the cost to make it required you can see is asking for the value

44
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.920
to that to.

45
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.150
So instead of this we can get rid of this and pass in the title.

46
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.940
How did you look over and over here?

47
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.020
We can then say.

48
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.000
So I'm just going to click on this error.

49
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.640
You for this title.

50
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.310
And this is going to say accounts.

51
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.080
Accounts in for.

52
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.260
Okay.

53
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.070
Click on this and try to.

54
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.710
This is going to say accounts.

55
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.190
Cities.

56
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.450
Cities.

57
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.670
Okay.

58
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.460
We can just give some breathing space.

59
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.170
It's in this and use control and that's the save.

60
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.280
And you can see the consensus over here.

61
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.350
Okay.

62
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.140
Sounds good, right?

63
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.660
Okay.

64
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.300
Now, this is your assignment.

65
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.830
You're going to try to make this container reusable.

66
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.620
That is this entire container.

67
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.380
I remember we have this list in this container, right?

68
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.620
So you're going to make this entire container reusable and you're going to change all this value.

69
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.000
Right.

70
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.210
Okay.

71
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.440
So you're going to do that over here.

72
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.600
So try to see if you can do that.

73
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.380
And in the next lecture, we are going to do it together.

74
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.950
Okay.
