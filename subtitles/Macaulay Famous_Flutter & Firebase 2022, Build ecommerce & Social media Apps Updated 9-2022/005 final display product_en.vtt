00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.410
Worker In this lecture, we're going to continue from where we start.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.530
Now you can see over the finished step we have this widget on top of the image.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.820
Now to do this, you're going to need to go back to our record.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.410
In the last lecture we had earlier use a stock widget.

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.560
The reason for this dark widget is because we want to be able to place widgets on top of widgets.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.270
Okay, now we are going to need to use control and be in a that's a big this wide.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.800
Okay.

9
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.080
That's a place with lots of widgets.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.490
This stock widget has a property known as position.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.310
So after this container, we're going to give it to the cover that we're going to say, pull the shed.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.250
Okay.

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.420
This is the tide is going to be I call it for now.

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.560
Later we're going to do.

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.700
This.

16
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.590
That is just as we get for now, we can just have an I call widgets.

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.960
Okay.

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.930
Icon widget.

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.230
It is going to be icons, dots, fable.

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.380
Civil rights.

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.790
Okay.

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.260
I caused that fever, right?

23
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.230
I think it's okay.

24
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.790
So I'm just going to get rid of this.

25
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.140
Let's say we have an icon like this.

26
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.550
Okay.

27
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.940
Great.

28
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.910
Now.

29
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.470
I think we need to have it.

30
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.030
Okay.

31
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.070
Over in this, you can see we need an additional parenthesis then.

32
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.660
The Control initiative.

33
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.580
And good check what you just did.

34
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.170
Okay.

35
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.950
You can see it now.

36
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.340
There.

37
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.430
Now we can tickets to the right to do that.

38
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.230
This position has a variety.

39
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.030
So you can see rates of 20.

40
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.270
Okay.

41
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.950
So they're going to go to the right now.

42
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.900
Okay.

43
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.340
Great.

44
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.850
Now, can I take it a bit from the top so you can't see top?

45
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.360
Oh 15.

46
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.020
Okay.

47
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.250
And go check it out.

48
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.880
Okay, great.

49
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.700
Now, this icon of the property known as color, so you can see color follows that red.

50
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.530
Okay.

51
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.880
Now we are not doing this because in your future we will show you how to do the same thing, but using

52
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.510
a package.

53
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.670
So that's why in in any future lecture we are going to do this for for now we're just going to go with

54
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.060
this.

55
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.640
I call the widgets.

56
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.010
Okay.

57
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.100
So we can add the background to this icon.

58
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.190
To do that, we need to have this icon which acts as a container.

59
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.590
So over here, we're going to use control and then we're going to go to our ports container.

60
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.010
Right.

61
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.570
Then over here we can have a decoration and a box.

62
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.630
The crucial class.

63
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.050
Right.

64
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.720
Okay.

65
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.130
Then we can see color is going to be colors those white.

66
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.300
Okay.

67
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.410
Go check it out.

68
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.530
Okay.

69
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.880
Now we can make this rounded, right?

70
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.280
By using what's the shape?

71
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.900
So you can see the issue is going to be box shape.

72
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.550
That circle.

73
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.580
Okay.

74
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.450
Okay.

75
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.480
You.

76
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.300
I think this is more over the content you can give.

77
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.840
Pardon.

78
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.820
It's going to be ages sets.

79
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.030
Their agent said that all we're just going to say it's okay.

80
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.730
Then as well, we can reduce this icon.

81
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.680
So this icon we did as a property, not our size, we can just see 15.

82
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.030
Okay.

83
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.780
Is controlling.

84
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.740
This is safe and good.

85
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.310
Check it out.

86
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.210
Okay.

87
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.930
Great.

88
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.770
Right.

89
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.150
Okay.

90
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.980
So now the next thing we're going to do is I say decant in our story outside the stock.

91
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.370
Right.

92
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.070
We are going to have, first of all, the chain of command, then they're going to have exists widgets

93
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.910
to display the name of the cause, the name of the products.

94
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.530
So there's going to be close.

95
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.860
The arts.

96
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.399
Product name.

97
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.149
Okay.

98
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.550
You can convert it to a string.

99
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.660
That's a string.

100
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.110
Okay.

101
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.910
Either through a comma.

102
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.170
Okay.

103
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.390
Go check it out.

104
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.170
Okay.

105
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.100
You can sit there.

106
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.920
Now we can give this a try.

107
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.910
So there's going to be a test.

108
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.170
So I.

109
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.220
Then test.

110
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.090
Tie.

111
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.220
First of all, you can change the font size.

112
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.280
So font suites to form suites.

113
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.940
That board.

114
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.690
Okay.

115
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.690
Right.

116
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.130
Okay.

117
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.020
Great.

118
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.020
Now we can't turn of the price so that you cover test.

119
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.920
We did right okay is going to be close to that's.

120
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.280
Price.

121
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.750
Okay.

122
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.400
Then you can convert it to two string to say to test the case either to recover.

123
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.590
And then as well.

124
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.170
You can of a sty.

125
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.850
It's going to be test sty.

126
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.840
Right.

127
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.090
You can't see font.

128
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.250
Weeds.

129
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.470
Front weeds.

130
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.480
That boat.

131
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.100
Okay.

132
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.460
The takeover and go check it out.

133
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.900
But I think they are way too close to what we can do.

134
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.300
We can say.

135
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.090
Height.

136
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.070
Of one third.

137
00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.140
Right on.

138
00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.710
This is.

139
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.120
Okay.

140
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.020
Try and cover.

141
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.960
Okay.

142
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.520
As well.

143
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.990
We can see how it's.

144
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.500
1.6.

145
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.500
Okay.

146
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.160
Great.

147
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.410
Now it is more like the size works, right?

148
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.770
Okay.

149
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.530
Grids.

150
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.220
Now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take this to the side of it, I think is way

151
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.450
too far from the left.

152
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.790
So to do this, I'm going to go to the whole.

153
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.850
The home screen.

154
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.320
Now what we can do is over the scale of widgets probably use across us settlements, across US alignment.

155
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.840
Across us is.

156
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.760
Elements, thoughts starts.

157
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.050
So we want allowed to start from the left.

158
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.420
Right.

159
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.760
Okay, great.

160
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.540
Okay.

161
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.910
Now, we can give some margin to this.

162
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.620
Okay.

163
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.990
We can go back to the products.

164
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.860
Then over this container you basically want to give the pardon to.

165
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.220
Over here.

166
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.480
You can see margin edge.

167
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.250
It said that all old sides or 15 is going to check and see what it does.

168
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.530
Okay.

169
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.140
I think 15 is way too much.

170
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.320
Okay.

171
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.010
Great.

172
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.700
Right.

173
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.270
Okay.

174
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.220
Look in grades.

175
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.570
Okay, guys, see you in a this picture.
