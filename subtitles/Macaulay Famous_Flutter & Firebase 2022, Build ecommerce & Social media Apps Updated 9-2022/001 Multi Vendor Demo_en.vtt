For the men.

178
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.430
You can just click on this link.

179
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:18.810
It can.

180
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.450
This is the sheds category or subcategory and t shirts.

181
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.660
Okay.

182
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.840
You can see we don't have any product yet for this t shirt and the jacket.

183
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.600
Okay.

184
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.450
Sounds good, right?

185
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.830
They are really a lot of features I can't really cover.

186
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.590
I can't really show you.

187
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.460
And you can see the orders, the name, the time and everything.

188
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.330
And we ordered from Wichita.

189
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.550
I think this is a product we just ordered and we heard that from to know that we just have to click

190
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.210
on this.

191
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.750
It's going to take us to the store where that product is.

192
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.430
And you can see the product on the dollar.

193
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.620
And it was Mac Mac's store that uploaded the products.

194
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.520
Okay.

195
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.710
So what I'm just going to do, I'm going to log out to show you the seller's.

196
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.180
The seller's accounts.

197
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.090
You can see we can edit photo, we can change password and it's going to log out.

198
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.480
Okay.

199
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.290
Seems good.

200
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.620
Then I'm going to log into a seller's account.

201
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.970
Create.

202
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:27.520
The key.

203
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:28.790
Early.

204
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.000
I have an account, so I'm just going to click on log in.

205
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.620
Okay.

206
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.880
I'm going to log in to my store.

207
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.770
So I am going to say Mac.

208
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.780
Stir.

209
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:47.750
At Gmail dot com and the password is being G-a-y esque.

210
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.860
I'm just going to hide my password from you.

211
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.150
Okay.

212
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:50.940
Log in.

213
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.010
And it's going to take us to the sailor home screen.

214
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.360
And you can see the bottom navigation bar is a bit different.

215
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.960
And you can see over here we have the dashboard.

216
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:12.080
And over here we have the statistics of the user and you can see the user as sold up to ten products

217
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:19.880
and you can see item counts and you can see the total balance of the seller.

218
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.730
2003 hundred.

219
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.850
That's very huge.

220
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:30.740
Hopefully have such money and you can see the balance of the user and the user can choose to get this

221
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.400
money.

222
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.460
That is the cellar.

223
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.950
And you can see it stirs.

224
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.040
And I think we recently purchased this product.

225
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.040
Right.

226
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.930
So what we can do.

227
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.440
We can go to these orders and you can see why we have the preparing section.

228
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.260
We have the shipping section.

229
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.970
So far, I think this product is currently shipping for another user.

230
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.530
This product is currently shipping for my famous.

231
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.590
And the email address of the user that ordered the product is my colleague.

232
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.460
Famous email that's calm and.

233
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:21.260
So far he has delivered up to one, two, 3456026123456 up to six products.

234
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.750
Now, what we have to do is.

235
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.130
Over.

236
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.550
Yeah, we have this.

237
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:27.540
Okay.

238
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.340
This is from John.

239
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.330
And over here, we're going to click on this.

240
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:39.760
And to set a shipping date for the shipping date, I'm going to say to we're going to ship this product

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.090

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.930
delivered.

245
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.270

And you can see the delivery status is delivered and you can see the payment status is cash on delivery.

251
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.780
Like you can see via this.

252
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.780
This order has been delivered.

253
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.820
Sounds good, right?

254
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.320
So you're going to know how to do all this.

255
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:22.900
Don't worry.

256
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.200
You'll be able to do all this by yourself.

257
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.500
Okay.

258
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.520
I can't really go through all these features.

259
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.080
And you can see we have the we can choose to upload a product.

260
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:41.400
We can choose to select from various categories that is the man women and probably this and we have

261
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:48.390
the subcategory maybe t shirts and the price, the quantity, the product name, the description of

262
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.200
the products and we can pick multiple image.

263
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.000
Okay.

264
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.830
I'm going to pick this.

265
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.490
This.

266
00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.210
This.

267
00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.840
This.

268
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.530
This.

269
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.240

Select.

271
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.260
And you can see we can even slide this way.

272
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.980
And then after everything we can then click on upload.

273
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:10.730
Definitely.

274
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.990
We're going to have all these errors, right, because all these fields are required.

275
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.640
Okay.

276
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.880
And over here.

277
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.800
Okay.

278
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.870

283
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.700
Leader.

284
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.230
John.

285
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.730
It's Gmail.

286
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.050
It's calm.

287
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.530
Jameel.

288
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.370
That's calm.

289
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.150
And the password is MSC.

290
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.260
Just going to hide it from you again and log in.

291
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.510
Okay.

292
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.310
We just have to wait for this.

293
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.070
Wait for this a bit.

294
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.430
Okay.

295
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.370
And back to the customer home screen.

296
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:19.670
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to draw up a review for that product since it has been delivered

297
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.270
to me.

298
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.230
Okay.

299
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.780
To do that, we have to go to the orders.

300
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.250
And.

301
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.820
You can see writes a review.

302
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.340
It has been delivered, right?

303
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.750
I'm going to give my review.

304
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.050
I think the product was very nice.

305
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.790
It's very cool.

306
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.640
But I'm just going to give five star.

307
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.320
It deserves it.

308
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.160
Okay.

309
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.570
I'm going to say over here.

310
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.670
Well, it's a good.

311
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.510
It's an.

312
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.950
Good item.

313
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.890
And.

314
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.050
Okay.

315
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.520
And we just add that this okay you can see review added.

316
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.980
Don't worry.

317
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.780
You'll be able to do all this.

318
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:06.980
Okay.

319
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.530
And over here, you can see the VAT and scroll reviews.

320
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.079
Okay.

321
00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.569
You can see now we have Joy Mach, we have leader John.

322
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.790
And John said, good item, I think this is us.

323
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.430
Right.

324
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.119
Okay.

325
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.319
Sounds good.

326
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.960
Sounds good, Sims.

327
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.160
Very, very cool.

328
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.690
Right.

329
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.200
Okay.

330
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.820
I think I'm just going to stop here.

331
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:44.660
But definitely after this course, you will be able to build this from scratch with not just with extremely

332
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.380
understanding.

333
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.170
That is, you be able to do this by yourself.

334
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.720
Every code is written from scratch.

335
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.500
So definitely after this course you will be able to build all this from all these sections, different

336
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.270
categories, such.

337
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:07.370
And everything you're saying over here, you'll be able to build everything yourself from from scratch.

338
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:08.380
Okay.

339
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.810
Okay.

340
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.060
Okay, guys.

341
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.560
See you in the chorus.
