00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.589
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.640
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.900
In this lecture, we are going to create the dashboard screens, but before then, what you have to

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.080
do is to log into a seller's accounts.

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.450
Okay, now what we can do is we turn the views.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:27.090
That way we can create a new folder and we can call this folder dashboard.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.090
Underscore screens.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.720
Okay.

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.120
And back to the dashboard on the screen.

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.930
Five.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.440
The first screen we need is the store screen.

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.110
Right.

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.950
But this is going to be for the seller, right?

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.490
Okay.

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.320
Because definitely the user the seller is going to be able to manage the store.

16
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.030
There are others there that provide manage products, balance and statics.

17
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.490
Okay.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.310
Now back to the dashboard screen.

19
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.600
The first screen we want to create is the.

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.190
We can just call this store on the screen.

21
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.870
Or we can just maybe have Scylla to be a bit more specific.

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.040
Okay.

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.950
Sailor on the score store.

24
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.860
On the score screen, then the dot.

25
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.710
Okay.

26
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.660
And the other screen we need is the we can as well just say seller order because remember we also do

27
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.940
have another screen known as customer order, right?

28
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.320
So we can also be a bit more specific.

29
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.130
So this is going to be seller.

30
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.460
Father on the screen, then the dot.

31
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.100
Okay.

32
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.780
I'm just going to go back to the dashboard on the screen.

33
00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:01.250
In that to the second set screen we need is the edit profile, edit profile and manage product.

34
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.230
Okay.

35
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.030
Back to the dashboard screens.

36
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.979
We can just go ahead and see a date on the score profile.

37
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.000
Then screen.

38
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.100
Then the doth.

39
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.150
Okay.

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.770
We need for.

41
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.860
The manage on the score product.

42
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.990
On the score screen.

43
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.710
Dot.

44
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.430
Dot.

45
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.580
I think.

46
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.310
Okay, back to the dodge ball screen.

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.080
We need the balance and statics.

48
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.760
Okay.

49
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.240
This OC.

50
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.040
We can call this balance.

51
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.380
On this car screen and the Darth.

52
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.020
And last.

53
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.500
We need to start six on the score screen, then the OC.

54
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.590
And within the balance screen, we can just go ahead and create a stateless widget and since we can

55
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.660
update it to stateful widgets if the need arise.

56
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.210
Okay.

57
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.550
And this is going to be balanced.

58
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.500
So balance.

59
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.730
Screen.

60
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.920
And Novaya, we need to alight in this country.

61
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.130
And, you know, that's important material to that package.

62
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.740
And we can get rid of this and we're just going to go out and use a scaffold.

63
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.210
The Scaffold widget.

64
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.110
Scaffold.

65
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.470
You know, that's how I've access to a lot more properties.

66
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.480
We can get rid of this.

67
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.750
And within the scaffold it has a property.

68
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.360
Sorry.

69
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.830
I think.

70
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.970
Correct.

71
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.650
But the.

72
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.820
And for now, we can just have a center.

73
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.600
We just.

74
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.470
Or maybe maybe a container.

75
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.160
Or maybe another number should be okay only.

76
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.400
Okay for now.

77
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.750
Okay.

78
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.590
And what we can just as we can light everything and copy.

79
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:23.680
And we are then going to pass it over and now we have to rename this to added profile, then screen.

80
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.270
Okay.

81
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.630
And over here too.

82
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.840
We need to pace this and.

83
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.690
We are then going to call this I think my niche on this product.

84
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.660
Sorry, my niche product then screen and.

85
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.270
Face this.

86
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.470
Sorry, not.

87
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.860
Okay.

88
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.060
This is going to be.

89
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.400
This.

90
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.600
I think I made this mistake of, okay, I'm just going to go out at first.

91
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.600
This is going to be sailor.

92
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.310
Order.

93
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.920
Order then screen.

94
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.570
Okay.

95
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.000
And this is going to be cellar store, then screen.

96
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.730
And.

97
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.370
Paste, then this is going to be so.

98
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.390
This is going to be six.

99
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.570
Okay.

100
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.170
Statics and we have to correct this spell.

101
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.530
Here we have.

102
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:42.910
Okay you concur and that's the save and also concur and se contra and se.

103
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.280
Culture and se.

104
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.610
Puncture an x and.

105
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.630
Contra and ex OC.

106
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.100
Now back to the dashboard screen.

107
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.570
Back to the dashboard screen is control.

108
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.390
And B, what we have to do now is to make all this clickable.

109
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.880
Right.

110
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.250
Okay.

111
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.380
To do that, we are going to open this with a button.

112
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.600
You can see why we have in this card so we can just apply this and use control dots, wrap widgets,

113
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.850
and we can just wrap this with a gesture detector or maybe an inkwell.

114
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.380
Okay.

115
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.960
Ink.

116
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.240
Well.

117
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.760
Okay.

118
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.170
And as you know, the Inquirer has a property known as On Tap.

119
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.910
Which is a function.

120
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.640
And what we are going to be doing is.

121
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.610
We are going to be saying we get the push right.

122
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:55.760
But you can see currently we have up to I think up to one, two, two, four, five, six, six screen.

123
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.530
Right.

124
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.900
So what we can just as we can assess is screen by the index.

125
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.330
To do this, we have to create a list and we can create this list over here.

126
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.890
We can just go ahead and specify.

127
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.940
It is a list.

128
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.290
A list of.

129
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.210
Widgets.

130
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.200
Right.

131
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.380
You can see over here in this.

132
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.230
In this screen we have.

133
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.940
You can see it's at least it is.

134
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.370
All these are referred to as widgets, right?

135
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.330
The harbor widget.

136
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.210
So that was why we have to specify.

137
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.660
We are expecting widgets.

138
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.140
Okay.

139
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.180
And we can call this variable pages.

140
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.110
Pages.

141
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.500
So it's going to be equal a third and add this.

142
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.180
Okay.

143
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.880
And for now, the first one is going to be the seller.

144
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.180
Sailor, I think.

145
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.320
Sailor, sir.

146
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.840
So, screen audio Yokohama.

147
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.580
And the other is going to be the seller.

148
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.670
The seller.

149
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.450
Order!

150
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.650
Order!

151
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.520
Screen!

152
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.060
Okay.

153
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:18.200
Make sure you are in your coma as you can get summaries and dates.

154
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.840
Profile screen.

155
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:28.700
Comer I think allies in this country and also imported and get rid of this.

156
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.480
Okay.

157
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.559
And we need to manage products.

158
00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:39.210
Buy this product, ice cream and the balance.

159
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.799
Of course we need our balance after making any sales from products.

160
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.480
I think we also do need to highlight and use country and dot.

161
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.820
Okay.

162
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.320
We need to start six.

163
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.800
Statics are state.

164
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.710
Okay, Star.

165
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.790
Statistics audit recorded stats since.

166
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:06.830
Okay.

167
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.400
I think we just call the statistics without adding screen to it.

168
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.190
I love adding screens to my.

169
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.990
To the name of my screens in order doesn't make it more clear or more understandable.

170
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.180
You can just add a screen to it.

171
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.470
And back to this.

172
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.700
We're going to be having this error.

173
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.760
So we have to then say screen.

174
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.530
Okay.

175
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:36.670
And hopefully we're not going to have any hero again in this country unless they say, okay, and now

176
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.090
what's in the function?

177
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.140
We can then say na na ve get her.

178
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.520
Navigator.

179
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.350
The arch push.

180
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.230
And.

181
00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:01.200
This is my Syria page roots or roots whatsoever where you pronounce it.

182
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:01.650
Okay.

183
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.110
This is going to be contest.

184
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.500
And we can just use another function for this.

185
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.750
Okay.

186
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.670
Our function and basically we want to call that variable called pages.

187
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:22.060
Pages and we want to access each of the page by the index that is zero one, two, two, four, five.

188
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.520
Right.

189
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.050
Okay.

190
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.710
Okay.

191
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.750
Zero.

192
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.920
12345.

193
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.390
OC use contra save and see if it's going to work without us without stats because we did not actually

194
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.610
create a stateful widget.

195
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:49.060
Most of the time you have to refresh whenever you create a stateful widgets and notice that less widgets.

196
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.470
And let's see.

197
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.270
OC did not work.

198
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.430
Okay.

199
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.090
It means we have to restart our hub.

200
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.500
Okay.

201
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.670
Dashboard.

202
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:02.680
Okay.

203
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.820
Now let's we start.

204
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.460
It's going to take some time to alter your stats.

205
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:17.090
And that was what I was trying to actually avoid in in order not to get you bored with all this.

206
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.390
I think it's a bit faster today.

207
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:20.910
Okay.

208
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.450
And let's wait for this.

209
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.470
Okay.

210
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.040
And now we have to log into a seller account.

211
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:36.650
It's seller account and you are just going to log in to, I think, famous store.

212
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.240
US.

213
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.510
Gmail.

214
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:47.500
Gmail dot com and the password is BGR may see.

215
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.860
And we can then click on log in.

216
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.400
Okay.

217
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.840
We tend to log in.

218
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.820
Okay.

219
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.940
And now we can go to Dashboard and click on my store.

220
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:02.720
Great.

221
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.940
And now we can just create those bar for it.

222
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.500
Okay.

223
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.880
Back to.

224
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.230
Balance.

225
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:19.220
First of all, we can change the background color to colors white.

226
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.920
And as you know, the harbor has a property known as elevation.

227
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.650
We can set this to zero.

228
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.770
And as you know, the harbor has a property known as title.

229
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.870
And this is going to be.

230
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.090
Is just going to say balance.

231
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.910
Screen.

232
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.570
Okay.

233
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.700
And you won't see this, so we can just go ahead and give this a color.

234
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.120
Of colors that black.

235
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.310
Okay.

236
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.650
And I think we are missing an audition.

237
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.410
Okay.

238
00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.230
Sorry.

239
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.740
This and this country and has to save.

240
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:05.450
Okay.

241
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:14.070
And as you know, the the caller so I think not on the screen, but the balance screen.

242
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.640
And you can see we can't see that error.

243
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.270
And I think you already know how to sort that out within the harbor.

244
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.970
It has the property known as icon theme.

245
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.770
And this is going to be icon.

246
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.910
Icon icon team then data then sorry, I contain.

247
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.800
Theme, then data.

248
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.210
Then we can change the colour to colours the black.

249
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.820
Okay.

250
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.960
And it's contrary to save.

251
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.170
You can see why I think it is very cool to be at this sport.

252
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:58.910
So what we can just do now in order to save our life or save us from stress, we can just copy this

253
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.690
ABBA and hopefully you can do this by yourself.

254
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.670
Use control and see it's copy and we can replace this.

255
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:09.760
Okay.

256
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.120
And now we can just call this.

257
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.530
Indeed.

258
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.770
At the profile screen.

259
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.410
Okay.

260
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.340
That's.

261
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.460
Okay.

262
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.370
We can.

263
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.790
Get rid of this contrariness.

264
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.800
This is going to be what?

265
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.200
Manage.

266
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.000
We can just use a capital letter for this.

267
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.230
Manage.

268
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.440
What products?

269
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.500
Or maybe you could just get rid of that screen.

270
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.620
These already know you're currently in the screen.

271
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.170
Okay.

272
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.630
Okay.

273
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.580
I'm just going to check the others looks.

274
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.130
If probably it's way too long, we can just get rid of that that screen.

275
00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.170
My niche products.

276
00:14:59.580 --> 00:14:59.800
Okay.

277
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.120
I think that is okay.

278
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.410
My niche product.

279
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.850
I think it's okay and we can just go to this and we can get rid of this and paste this.

280
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.070
This is going to be sell to other.

281
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.680
Seller order.

282
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.720
Screen.

283
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.400
Okay.

284
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.360
And this is going to be Lester.

285
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.630
OC and seller.

286
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.470
Then start.

287
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.680
You already know what is going to be here.

288
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.520
You can just copy the customer store and paste it over here.

289
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:36.630
Okay.

290
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.510
No, sorry, don't do that.

291
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.280
This is going to be all the products for that seller.

292
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.890
Okay.

293
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.570
And.

294
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.930
Okay.

295
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.750
And and.

296
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.230
And and and and.

297
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.060
Yeah, I think you can do that.

298
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.320
Don't worry.

299
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.210
We are just going to do it together.

300
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.650
Okay?

301
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.440
Yeah, you can do that.

302
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.690
Because we are basically between each our store.

303
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.970
So you can basically just do.

304
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.580
That or maybe in the future we are just going to do this together.

305
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.050
So you do not worry.

306
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.540
Okay, now let's check all this.

307
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.310
My store, we have the seller's store screen and order we have.

308
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:27.530
Okay.

309
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.760
I think we are missing that for the order.

310
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.810
Seller order we did not save.

311
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.880
Okay.

312
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:41.820
Okay.

313
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.630
Good.

314
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.990
My store.

315
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.730
Orders.

316
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.110
Edit profile.

317
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.670
Niche products.

318
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.290
Balance Queen.

319
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:05.849
And lastly, statistics, service statistics skewing.

320
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.400
And hopefully you understand all this.

321
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.069
But if you don't, you can please do well to let me know.
