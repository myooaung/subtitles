00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.780
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.850
In this lecture, we are going to create the subcategory and it's going to look very similar to that

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.570
of this.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.750
So what we can do is we can copy from this test we get and to this part you can try and see.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.400
Sorry.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.490
And we are going to pace this over here.

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.310
And instead of select main category, we are going to change this as a select sub category.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.240
Now use control and has to save.

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.220
And you're going to see your rights over here.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.080
Okay.

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.560
Now, the next step is to change the value of this, because when a user clicks on this man or chooses

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.380
this man category, all main item should be displayed over here.

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.830
Right.

15
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.390
So we have to change the value.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.480
But before then, you can see we already have this list over here which says Men.

17
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.970
Right.

18
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.150
So these are the men clothes, right?

19
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.750
Okay.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.200
So what we have to do first is to create a default value, which is going to be displayed over here.

21
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.400
Okay.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.930
We have to do that first.

23
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.570
Look at the top.

24
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.590
And we are setting the test.

25
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:28.550
So it is going to be a type of string and we can call this variable sub category value and the default

26
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.090
value must be within the list.

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.800
You can see how this list of why you called men.

28
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.120
And now in order to peak, in order to make a default value, the default value must be within this

29
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.330
list.

30
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.260
You can see for the for the.

31
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.820
For the string main category value we said is main.

32
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.640
And you can see the value is in this list, right?

33
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.750
Okay, let's just choose something which is not in this list and see what's going to happen.

34
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.440
Okay.

35
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.180
And is it of this?

36
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.070
I'm going to say select.

37
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.670
Select SOB category and let's see, select sub select.

38
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510
So see, sorry, category.

39
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.360
Okay, great.

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.470
And now.

41
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.680
Over here.

42
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.390
We can change this to be the main category.

43
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.390
Okay.

44
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.260
Men.

45
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.210
Okay.

46
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.560
Okay.

47
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.870
And do we start this now?

48
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.270
You see the error.

49
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.270
So we also have to change this value to say sub category.

50
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.200
Okay.

51
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.000
So.

52
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.650
Subcategory value.

53
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.890
Okay.

54
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.800
And it's going to copy this.

55
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.290
And pass this over.

56
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.870
Yeah.

57
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.620
Sorry.

58
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.800
Sub.

59
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.100
Okay.

60
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.340
Also start this.

61
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.700
All three starting.

62
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.710
All three.

63
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.710
We just have to wait for this a bit.

64
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.570
Okay.

65
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.790
And let's go check it out.

66
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.560
Definitely.

67
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.450
We are going to have an error.

68
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.600
Okay, good.

69
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.380
Check this.

70
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.840
Okay.

71
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.320
You can see we have this error and read what is saying item is empty.

72
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.640
Value is equal is equal to null and there should be exactly one item with the dropdown value.

73
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.190
So let's select subcategory.

74
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.560
It does zero or two or more updates.

75
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.720
We are dictated in the same value.

76
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.910
You can see what is basically trying to see is we do not have this select subcategory within this list

77
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.960
called Main.

78
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.720
Okay, so what we have to do is the default value definitely must be within that list, right.

79
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.209
So we have to say, I think we have a value known as Shell's and it is a capital letter.

80
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.500
A case controller and has not to save.

81
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.210
We have to wait for this.

82
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.110
Wait for this and go check it out.

83
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.120
It's to hard.

84
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.030
We start this now, and there should be no heroes.

85
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.410
You can see no errors and you can see we have this -- and it is within the category, the man subcategory.

86
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.870
And we also can choose the shirts, the t shirts and jackets and you can see why.

87
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.900
What we simply did was to create a variable called subcategory.

88
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.270
It is.

89
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.760
It says so it is a type of string.

90
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:12.560
And over here, within the dropdown, within the dropdown button, the dropdown button has a property

91
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.610
known as value.

92
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.910
And over here, at this moment, this is going to be shared, right?

93
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:27.560
And via the within the dropdown button, it also has a property known as own change and.

94
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:37.730
We are basically set in state to update this sub category value to whatever the user is going to pick.

95
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.820
Right.

96
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.250
Okay.

97
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.430
We start this.

98
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.590
Or to start this.

99
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.390
And I'm just going to show you this again.

100
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.950
Okay.

101
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.090
We just have to wait.

102
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.100
Okay.

103
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.460
And back to the beginning.

104
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.720
Okay.

105
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.410
And now you can see the default value is shared, right?

106
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.550
So and this is what we are basically saying, the way the value is going to be whatsoever, we have

107
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.520
at the top and currently it is shared.

108
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.000
It's this --, right?

109
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.380
And nobody you can see.

110
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.090
We are saying when we tap.

111
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.010
So.

112
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.280
VI.

113
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.260
Yes, sorry.

114
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.760
Over.

115
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:26.810
Over a year we have seen when we tap whatsoever value we picked, we want to update this subcategory

116
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.030
value to the recent value.

117
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.120
Okay, now let's tap on.

118
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.820
Tissot is going to update that T-shirt and jacket.

119
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.330
It's going to update the T-shirts, the jacket and so on.

120
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.470
Okay.

121
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.400
Seems good.

122
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.160
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
