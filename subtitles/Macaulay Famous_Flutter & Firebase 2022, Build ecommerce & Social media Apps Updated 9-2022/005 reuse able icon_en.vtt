00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.730
Walker In this lecture, we're going to have four icons over here.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.600
And this four icons are going to be displayed horizontally, that is from left to right.

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.590
And this four icons are going to be similar.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.070
Okay.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
So now we're going to need to do is over this widget dietary.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.320
We're going to need to create a reusable icon widgets.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.740
Okay.

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.390
So over this which is directory, we are going to create a new PHI and we can just call this usable

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
underscore icon in this picture on Toad Dots.

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:46.530
And over here we can just go ahead and use this fitness widget and as well we can call this we use it

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.950
will.

13
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.210
I can't just spell it this way.

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.870
Okay.

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.750
And over here, we can then highlight and then use contra and dots in that same part.

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.090
The material to that package.

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.510
Okay.

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.380
And now we can just use Contra and B to make this wide.

19
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.400
Okay.

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.890
Now for the container, we can have a chart.

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.530
And the child is going to be an icon, which.

22
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.100
And like I said, we are going to make this reusable.

23
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.000
So what we can do is we can make this dynamic.

24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.750
Okay.

25
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.540
So over here, we can create a finite variable and we can just go ahead and call this variable icon.

26
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.220
And it is a type of something known as icon data.

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.330
Okay.

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.600
Now, the next thing is to pass it on to the constructor.

29
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.020
So any time we call this reusable icon, fi, we're going to need to pass in the value so this variable

30
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.870
so that a light is controlling dots then creates constructor for fine that fits.

31
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.570
Then over a year you're going to need to make this required all you can just add your note check to

32
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.000
see we don't really need to pass in the value.

33
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.350
Okay.

34
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
Now, over here, the icon is going to be the icon.

35
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.729
And we can give his size this icon against this size of turkey.

36
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.620
Okay, great.

37
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.030
He's controlling and save.

38
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.820
Now what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to go to the little screen and instead of

39
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.890
this, we're going to need to get rid of this.

40
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.430
Then use a widget known as sorry we just said wants to be displayed horizontally.

41
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.820
Right.

42
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.100
So we are going to be using what's a row widgets row widget is going to help us display our widgets

43
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.510
horizontally.

44
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.500
That is from left to right as well.

45
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.100
Just like the column, the row widget has a property known as children because it can take multiple

46
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.730
widgets.

47
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.180
And the first side is going to be that we.

48
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.610
We use able icons.

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.570
Okay.

50
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.840
Right.

51
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.940
I can I can see it wants us to parse the value.

52
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.080
The value is going to be something that's icons that video.

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.040
Com.

54
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.750
I think we have something like this.

55
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.460
Okay.

56
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.880
Okay.

57
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.290
Yeah.

58
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.490
Okay.

59
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay.

60
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.510
Okay.

61
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.050
Okay.

62
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.040
Nice country.

63
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.600
And that's to save and.

64
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.070
You're going to see it over a year.

65
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.270
Over a year.

66
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.870
Okay.

67
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.540
Now we can have hopes before.

68
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.410
Okay.

69
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.090
Okay.

70
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.030
Okay.

71
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.920
Okay.

72
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.570
Added sugar cover and you can change this icon since we made it reusable.

73
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.520
But for now, we can just go with this for now.

74
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.890
Okay.

75
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.120
Now check.

76
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.920
But you can see now all we can do is we can make this icon has because space now the road yet has something

77
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.700
known as name as this element that we can that's a main assets element that space evenly.

78
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.850
So this is going to share equal space for all the four icons we have.

79
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.180
Okay.

80
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.390
Okay.

81
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.550
You can see this space and this space and this space and this space and this.

82
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.510
Our whole same.

83
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.470
Okay.

84
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.250
Now, what we can also do is we can give a background color to this.

85
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.820
So each icon to do this, we can then go to our visible.

86
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.130
Icon and over this container.

87
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.390
In order to have access, we can easily just say color, right?

88
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.170
But in order to have access to loss of property inside this container, we can have something known

89
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.590
as decoration and box decoration.

90
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.360
And within the box decoration, the color is also found.

91
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.650
And we can see.

92
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.450
Callers.

93
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.440
Darts.

94
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.630
So you can just use the button colour which we have in the colours.

95
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.210
Firefox.

96
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.770
Try and save and see.

97
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.870
Okay.

98
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.360
Okay.

99
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.860
Okay.

100
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.310
Okay.

101
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.120
Okay.

102
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.920
Now, what we can do is we can say height of 60.

103
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.220
And we'd as well of 50 or 60.

104
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.660
Let's just take it that first.

105
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.430
Okay.

106
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.730
Okay.

107
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.090
Okay.

108
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:25.430
So the the container has the property, you know, that's height and what width and as well the decoration

109
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.200
and box decoration.

110
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.490
Right.

111
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.830
Okay.

112
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.020
So now what we can also do is we can give this some rounded shape.

113
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.740
Okay.

114
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.070
So to do this within the border bus decoration, it has something known as border radios.

115
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.240
And we can then say border radius dot circular and we can just say 16.

116
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.390
Okay.

117
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.570
Yes.

118
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.700
Contribute and save and see.

119
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.890
Okay.

120
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.090
Okay, great.

121
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.140
Now, what we can also do is we can give some little shadow to this.

122
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.560
Okay.

123
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.480
Now, within the boss decoration, the boss decoration also has a property.

124
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.930
All we can do is have the chain of command to know where this.

125
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.200
But the videos aren't.

126
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.150
And where we can then see Boss Shadow.

127
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.850
This is going to be a list of shadows.

128
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.570
Okay.

129
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.460
And now you can see, boss.

130
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.350
Shadow.

131
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.900
Okay.

132
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:35.860
The first thing is we can give a blow radius to make it blow and we can see we want ten year control

133
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.360
and excessive.

134
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.740
Okay.

135
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.520
Hopefully you can see that you can really see this now.

136
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.650
Then this boss shadow also has the color property, the little properties.

137
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.800
Each property has a key, and over it we can see colors that black.

138
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.360
Okay.

139
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.940
Now check it out.

140
00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.940
Now you're going to see it's.

141
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.770
Okay.

142
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.760
Hopefully you can see there's a little shadow around it that we can also see dots with opacity.

143
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.870
This means I'll block or I'll.

144
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.720
Doc, we want you to be with opacity of 0.7 and see.

145
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.210
Okay.

146
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.350
Okay.

147
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.510
Probably we change this to 50 and see 50 and.

148
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.250
Okay.

149
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.260
Okay.

150
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.950
You can see.

151
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.160
Okay, we can just go with the ten.

152
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.760
It's not really visible that much.

153
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.150
Okay.

154
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.790
Great.

155
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.570
So this is basically it's.

156
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.210
Okay.

157
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.780
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
