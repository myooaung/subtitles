00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.640
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.700
Or come nine last lecture.

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.210
I told you to create to this region and both regions are going to be displayed horizontally.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.150
That is from left to right.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.810
And one of the test regions is going to say, where do you have an account?

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.470
Then the test widget is going to sit there and log in.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.250
Okay.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
So if it comes to do it for me, that is absolutely fine.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.350
What I believe as the process goes, it is a masterpiece of how everything works.

10
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.250
Okay, so now what I'm going to do now in this lecture is you're going to create two test fields, both

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.070
of which are probably better left to right.

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.360
And one is going to say, I already have an account and to have a link to log in.

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.140
Okay.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.670
So now let's set both that a little bit horizontally.

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.280
And the other display widget is probably going to be using a widget known as row.

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.940
Okay.

17
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.020
So this is the end of the bottle we created from scratch right over here.

18
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.760
We see they just give a weight to the bottom that is all white.

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.190
The bottom is going to be those of you.

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.230
The height which is along the bottom is going to be that we gave a column to the bottom, which is a

21
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.510
column of where that's our bottom column, which is defined in a cost of 35.

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.500
Okay.

23
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.020
And over here, we simply just add to the test record.

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.700
This is to give a portrait of the plus size of its approach to the catalog figure.

25
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.830
Okay, now what we're going to do is we're going to have a greater cola.

26
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.000
And since we're going to this bit is two how horizontal?

27
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.300
Because it's from left to right.

28
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.790
I believe it will be the right to do that.

29
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.250
So basically all we widget that goes into it is going to be displayed horizontally.

30
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.490
Now this row as well can take multiple pages as speaking.

31
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.950
Okay.

32
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.539
Now, the first test widget is going to save already.

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.580
Okay.

34
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.620
We're going to go to the log in page.

35
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.920
Right.

36
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.090
So this is going to be.

37
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.780
Already.

38
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.390
Have an account.

39
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.570
Okay.

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.790
Sorry.

41
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.930
Jehovah.

42
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.600
Right.

43
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.950
Can I go check it out?

44
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.620
Okay.

45
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.790
This is the way they're going to take it to the center of a society that is from left to right.

46
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:56.360
So to do that over here in Maine, I mean, this alignment, the center is going to take it to the center

47
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.680
horizontally.

48
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.830
Okay, great.

49
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.350
Now, you can see we don't really have space.

50
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.930
So what we can do is we can use this size box to give this space vertically that is sort of at the bottom.

51
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.230
Right.

52
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.310
So this is going to be height of probably change as well.

53
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.570
Okay.

54
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.130
Great.

55
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.870
Now, the next day, we're going to have a contest that's going to log in.

56
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:35.890
So I'll tell you how critical they're going to have that says, okay, so the because first of all,

57
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.420
I'm just going to say this, I want to do this tie then is going to be tested.

58
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.600
So I'm just going to say the size of it, right?

59
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:58.630
Then they're going to call tweets of it's for tweets that both of the candidates this is either critical.

60
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.590
So that's a very, very good compromise.

61
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.790
Okay.

62
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.420
Now as all you can just go through this.

63
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.070
Well, this is a big win across all aspects as much as you can on my side.

64
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.260
So that's why I was going to be doing everything from.

65
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.500
I love doing everything and everything as we started the business.

66
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.940
So this is going to sit and log in and it's going to have this tie, really.

67
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.970
Right.

68
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:37.510
You're going to have this odd size of 18 as well, that influence it forwards, which is going to influence

69
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.860
which and both ideas are critical.

70
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.160
What are the hedges which are necessary?

71
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.780
Now check it out.

72
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.250
You can see we don't really have space between the already have an account on the log in.

73
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.140
So that's where there's two test fields.

74
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.610
I'm going to give it space between those.

75
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.960
Okay.

76
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.040
Now roughly the same size box.

77
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.130
Size was not going to be given the space.

78
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.000
Horizontally, that is from left to right.

79
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.680
Right so it's going to be weight of of the ten gadgetry to.

80
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.030
Okay.

81
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.750
Now, what you're going to do now is to wrap.

82
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.320
Just log in with a button.

83
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.630
So when you go to the street, it's going to take us to the register.

84
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.940
He's going to take us to the log in page.

85
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.910
So what you're going to do now is force feed you or try to implement that yourself.

86
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.210
Okay?

87
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.100
Okay.

88
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.780
If for any reason you can do it, I'm going to do it now.

89
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.170
So what you're going to do is of others, just which is like for us, everybody is going to add dots,

90
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.180
which we get since the user is not available.

91
00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.140
I just drove down click or with digits in a little traffic ticket, but it is going to be a kind of

92
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.320
equal.

93
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.940
You can, as we wrap this with the gesture gesture detector, it'll look similar because just will use

94
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.550
an equal because of those recordings we had something last year.

95
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.780
So you can say, well, okay, so we're going to have the on time.

96
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.300
Okay, great.

97
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.930
Well, I was going to add this to say that to get a very good of a lot.

98
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.310
Okay.

99
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.930
Now go check it out.

100
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.050
So it is cricket for now, right?

101
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.030
Okay.

102
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.660
Now what you can do is when does this click is going to trigger this function.

103
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.140
So now going to send the here to years of contest and darts.

104
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.680
Oh.

105
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.960
Well, it's a good idea.

106
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.440
Okay.

107
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.220
There's going to be a lot easier to page round for us.

108
00:06:50.810 --> 00:07:01.080
It is going to take in the contest and it's going to say we want to go to no option or to go to the

109
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.380
login screen.

110
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.890
Okay.

111
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.920
Are you trying to clear this issue?

112
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.470
Okay.

113
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.300
Now, when we type on it, we don't have an account.

114
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.630
Now, I can click on this to go to the log in.

115
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.780
What if we need an account to get as well?

116
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.620
Click on this.

117
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.170
So go to the register page.

118
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.620
Okay.

119
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.700
Okay, guys.

120
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.350
See you in the next lecture.
