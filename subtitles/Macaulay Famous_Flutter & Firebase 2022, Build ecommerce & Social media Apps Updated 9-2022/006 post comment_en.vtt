00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.620
In this lecture, we're going to be able to upload comments.

4
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.540
Okay, then let's do this.

5
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.110
We need to go back to our controller's entry and the comment controller and now we can use control and

6
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.010
B to make this way.

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.490
Okay.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
Now the first step is to save our comments to the cloud faster.

9
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.640
And as we said within the video collection, we want to have another collection which is going to be

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.510
for the comments.

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.930
Okay.

12
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.380
So now all we have to do is over here.

13
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.360
We're going to need to see our weight.

14
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.670
And then core your fire.

15
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.640
Stir fry, sir.

16
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.790
Faster dirt.

17
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.480
We have the collection, and we first need to assess the evidence collection.

18
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.230
Okay.

19
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.680
Now, you can see over here is video.

20
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.010
Each video is connected to this video collection based on what's the Heidi?

21
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.890
Right.

22
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.340
Okay.

23
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.390
So now all we have to do is the comments collection is going to be also connected to.

24
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.680
It's also going to be connected to this video collection based on something known as what, I.D. or

25
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.040
your ID.

26
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.670
Okay.

27
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
So over here we need to say that.

28
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
And you can see we have this post over your what we can just do is we can be more specific.

29
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.340
We can call this post on this.

30
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.450
Sorry, post, ID and post.

31
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.100
I'd.

32
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.220
Okay.

33
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:42.400
And over here, we're going to need to say on this car post ID so that comments collection is going

34
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.220
to be connected to this video collection based on.

35
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.500
The idea.

36
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.700
You can just see this as a rope or a road between two roads or a link between two roads.

37
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.180
Okay.

38
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.940
So now we can then say collection again and there's going to be comments.

39
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.900
Comments.

40
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.500
Okay.

41
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.500
And we can.

42
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.590
As well say good doc, because each comment is also going to be connected.

43
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.020
Like you can see over here, we just have one collection, right?

44
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.840
And each video is connected to this with this collection based on what's the idea.

45
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.010
Hopefully you understand this.

46
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.430
So that's what we basically say.

47
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.950
So this is more like we're just creating a new collection, right?

48
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.370
Okay.

49
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.450
So the doc as for the comment ID is going to be the length of how many comment we have.

50
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.680
You can see over here, we basically created the variable in a that's it just gets our many, many comments

51
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.190
we have.

52
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.880
Right.

53
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.690
Okay.

54
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.730
Hopefully you understand or hopefully I'll be able to explain to you or or the standard.

55
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.180
Okay.

56
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.040
So now we need to say comments and how to the a sign and length.

57
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.380
And now we can then say dot set.

58
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.990
I think you've seen this before, and you're going to need to call this comment.

59
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.800
This comment varied.

60
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.730
But now if you comment and we need to say dots to JSON or JSON and how you pronounce it.

61
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.380
Okay, great.

62
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160
Now, what we need to do next is over here.

63
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.330
You can see we created a variable and causes variable on this call post ID.

64
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.260
Right.

65
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.650
Okay.

66
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.620
And we said is going to be the link between is going to be the link between this video collection and

67
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.880
this comments collection.

68
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.210
Right.

69
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.550
And you can see over here, we do not have any value to it at the moment.

70
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.820
So all we can do is we can create a virtual card of dates, post ID.

71
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.400
And Lebanon need to create a dynamic variable.

72
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.040
So and then I'll call this function.

73
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.320
Lebanon needs a positive value to it.

74
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.770
And the way we can see on the score post ID.

75
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.500
Is going to be core to this idea we have over there.

76
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.190
Okay.

77
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.080
So whenever we call this post, so update post it.

78
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.480
We are going to need to pass the value to it, which is automatically going to be automatically going

79
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.080
to be here.

80
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.740
And automatically gonna be.

81
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.850
Yeah.

82
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.019
Okay, great.

83
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.530
So now all we can do is just try this to save.

84
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.850
And lastly.

85
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.700
We tend this cash, we can as well cause the era.

86
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.680
You can say get that.

87
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.390
Snack bar.

88
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.910
Okay.

89
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.220
For the title of the era.

90
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.420
Because the era.

91
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.940
Comments.

92
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.930
For the Expert Comment Committee.

93
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.400
And this is going to be what's e?

94
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.710
Dot to string.

95
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.900
Okay.

96
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.470
Great.

97
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.610
Okay, great.

98
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.350
Now, the next thing to do is to have access to this post comment.

99
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.800
Okay.

100
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.280
For the now, we're basically not retrieving our comments.

101
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.950
We are only able to watch post comments.

102
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.520
Right.

103
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.620
And in order to have access to this function, we first need to have access to this comments.

104
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.670
Controller class.

105
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.720
Okay.

106
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.270
So now we need to go to the common screen.

107
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.540
And over here we can create a finite variable and we can just go ahead and specify the type of variable

108
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.850
this a type of climate controller.

109
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.360
And now we cannot call this on the commit controller since you have this variable called this controller.

110
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.490
And remember this current controller is basically to get the input of what the user is actually committing.

111
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.580
Okay, now is this ready have this variable, we can just go ahead and call it hound command controller

112
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.990
and now we can then see get I think you've seen this before yet and what we can do is we can import

113
00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:03.260
this manually in the that's a path to get slash gets okay and now we can then say Dot's put and comments.

114
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.590
Controller.

115
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.680
Okay, great.

116
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.730
Okay.

117
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.940
Now the next thing to do is to rub this list view.

118
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.580
We with something known as obese.

119
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.040
And the reason for this obese is whenever we comment, we want that comment to be displayed life.

120
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.170
We don't want the user to refresh or do anything.

121
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.780
We just want that is that comment to be displayed like.

122
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.780
So whenever a user comments, probably when a user is in the comments screen, new comments will just

123
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.970
easily pop up with that of that user.

124
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.830
So refresh.

125
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.220
Okay.

126
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.600
So in order to do this, we need to wrap this for us.

127
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.780
We streamed you there.

128
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.590
Okay.

129
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.710
And we can basically get rid of what is inside here.

130
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.980
Get rid of this.

131
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.300
And.

132
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.750
This as well.

133
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.570
So.

134
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.910
Okay.

135
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.680
This as well.

136
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.630
Do we need to get rid of this?

137
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.850
And instead of this, we can then call this all B.

138
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.190
S.

139
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.640
Okay, great.

140
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.600
Now, we really don't need this at this moment because we are visibly not fetching any products.

141
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.190
Okay.

142
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.670
As of now, you're going to get a red arrow.

143
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.310
You're going to get that here.

144
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.360
Okay.

145
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:35.490
Because we basically wrap this with an obvious is basically in the item count as well.

146
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.600
The.

147
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.660
The data.

148
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.100
Okay.

149
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.790
And for the now, what we can then do is look.

150
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.240
Okay.

151
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.070
So what now?

152
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.870
So all we need to do this is we can get rid of this and use the higher function.

153
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.270
And that core the comments controller.

154
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.510
Comrade Controller.

155
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.400
You can just see and see what you're going to see.

156
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:01.840
Definitely.

157
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.360
You going to have this red area.

158
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.320
Okay.

159
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.150
I think, Manuel, it says green in the running.

160
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.180
If I'm with her on that later now, we can then see.

161
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.030
Sorry.

162
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.950
Post comment.

163
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.240
Okay.

164
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.400
For the post comments.

165
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.310
We have one field and the reasons for this field.

166
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.320
You can see we tend to the controller.

167
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.460
We passed this comment test field right away.

168
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.120
So over here, this is basically going to be the honest comments.

169
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.070
Controller and or test, you know, that's assets the value.

170
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.690
Okay, great.

171
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.220
Okay.

172
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.570
Now, the last thing to do is to basically code it.

173
00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:42.650
Okay.

174
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.280
So within the build, we need to call the comment controller.

175
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.210
And sort of date post ID.

176
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:51.870
Okay.

177
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.790
So now all we have to do is over the video screen.

178
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.770
You can see we have all the data.

179
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.160
Right.

180
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:08.640
And we said that, Heidi, of the video is basically how many video we have.

181
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.310
You can see this in the video screen.

182
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.110
So sorry, the video controller, you can see we want the video.

183
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.250
We weren't.

184
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.410
Sorry, not this.

185
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.340
Okay.

186
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.930
I think I did this behind the scene.

187
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.380
Yes.

188
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.130
Avoid this one.

189
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.600
Now, we're going to do that later.

190
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.770
Okay.

191
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.450
So within the video, you can see.

192
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.310
Okay with your controller.

193
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.800
Okay.

194
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.150
Sorry, not video controller body upload.

195
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:46.280
Sorry AKC we want the name of the Heidi, which is going to be the how many video we have.

196
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.540
Right.

197
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.880
Okay.

198
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.250
So that's what we also want.

199
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.700
Okay.

200
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.070
Hopefully, I think I'm talking too much.

201
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.830
Okay.

202
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.290
Okay.

203
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:56.660
Okay.

204
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.410
Sorry, I'm not.

205
00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.640
Okay, great.

206
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.820
So what we can do is.

207
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.010
Over here we can create a find available.

208
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.140
Open that confusing.

209
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:14.880
I think I'm talking about change and so for that okay I can just history and ID and now we need to pass

210
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.910
this on to the constructor creates constructor for final fields.

211
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.320
You're going to see this shot this sorry you can see goes magically positive required keyword.

212
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.130
Okay.

213
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.700
Great.

214
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.620
Now you're going to have this area.

215
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.130
Right.

216
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.540
Okay.

217
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.480
So now we need to go to the video screen and where we call that commit controller.

218
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.400
And for the ID, this is going to be data that we have.

219
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.500
They are.

220
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.990
The authorities we have data.

221
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.530
Are that it?

222
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.760
Okay, great.

223
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:46.990
Great.

224
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.900
Now I'm going to play what we are doing.

225
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:51.660
Eunice.

226
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.190
I'm going to take my time a little.

227
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.450
Come down to this before we do it.

228
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.920
Okay.

229
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.830
Now, in the comment controller, we created a rainbow card on the scope post ID.

230
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.490
Right.

231
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.690
And for now, we are not actually giving it to anybody.

232
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:15.180
And voila we created a functional court of dates post ID so you can see when we court that of this,

233
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.720
post it.

234
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.400
We passed and we didn't pass any value to.

235
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.880
It's a big deal.

236
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.620
Okay.

237
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.080
Sorry.

238
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.490
We then pass in the value to the common screen.

239
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.430
Why are there is no pass in the value?

240
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.620
Is.

241
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:42.590
So we are going to have access to it in the video screen because we call it this FI, we call this comic

242
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.030
controller.

243
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.560
And remember by ear, we are basically marketing it as what's required.

244
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.960
So we are going to need to pass in the value to this idea and the idea of the video.

245
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.530
So the Heidi is going to be the data.

246
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.120
Heidi.

247
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.570
And we said that, Heidi.

248
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.260
Is going to be what they applaud.

249
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.590
We said, Heidi, is going to be how many video we have.

250
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.000
Okay.

251
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.710
Well, let's we are just going to do now.

252
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.500
That's our void as long as tradition is.

253
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:21.960
Is to basically just randomly have their try to upload the current and then you're going to need to

254
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.800
check your videos collection and then you're you're going to see the idea is going to be connected to

255
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.860
something similar like this and you're going to see the comments collection.

256
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.220
Okay.

257
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.300
Okay.

258
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.630
I'm sick.

259
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.040
I'm taking way too much.

260
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.490
Okay.

261
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.030
So now all you have to do is to run your hop.

262
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.300
I think my this is going to take some time to run.

263
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:48.090
So you can't just run your lap over here and try to comment.

264
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:48.960
Definitely.

265
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.620
Definitely.

266
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.910
You're going to see red hair.

267
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.140
Just get with that and just go ahead and comment in that that comment thing.

268
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.720
Try to go to this and go back to the data in that that's automatically refresh.

269
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.430
Then go check your video collection.

270
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.370
You're then going to see a new collection called Comments.
