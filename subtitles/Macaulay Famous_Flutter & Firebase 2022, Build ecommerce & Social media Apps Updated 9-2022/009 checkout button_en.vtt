00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.710
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.980
Now over here, we're going to have the checkout button and the way we're going to have a test, widgets

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.550
wishes is going to say total price and the value are going to have the total price of all the products

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.880
we had.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.690
That's our costs.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.050
Okay.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.300
Not to do this, nobody need to go back to our code.

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.640
Okay.

10
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
Now, first of all, in order to display widgets at this spot.

11
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.110
The scaffold.

12
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.190
Widgets.

13
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.430
As a property known as bottom --.

14
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.130
Okay.

15
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.720
You can even do it a tough year.

16
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.510
Right.

17
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.010
But must be within the scaffold.

18
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.760
So let confess in flutter.

19
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.340
It does not really matter.

20
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
Okay, Casi, but some -- like it's going to be over here.

21
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.600
Okay.

22
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.730
Now.

23
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.950
We can't just take this to the bottom.

24
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.270
Okay.

25
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.410
Bottom.

26
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.330
--.

27
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.840
Okay.

28
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.780
Now, like I said, we are going to be having three main widgets.

29
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.000
The.

30
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.320
Button widgets.

31
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.110
The says widgets.

32
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.980
Which is going to say.

33
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.760
So surprise.

34
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.160
And then what's it going to have in the test, which again, was going to be for the.

35
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.520
All the products we have added the total price of all the products we have added.

36
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.400
So our costs.

37
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.720
Okay.

38
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
So not to do this, you know, not to display widgets horizontally, you're going to be using the widgets

39
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.410
which are already known.

40
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.870
That's the role.

41
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.000
Okay as well.

42
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.610
This role can take multiple widgets.

43
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.740
So it's as if children.

44
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.100
Okay.

45
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.510
Now for the first child is going to be the.

46
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.170
The.

47
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.840
Elevated, but they oppress.

48
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.010
Okay.

49
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.310
Now the child is going to be a test it wishes is going to say check.

50
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.900
LBS.

51
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.670
Okay.

52
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.400
Addiction and use culture and this to safe.

53
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.450
But you're going to see that this was.

54
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.280
Okay, great.

55
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.540
Now, what we can do is we can rob this button with an expanded widget so the buttons will take the

56
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.440
available space.

57
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.960
Okay, now via a light and use control.

58
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.250
And that wrap with widgets is going to be expanded.

59
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.810
Expanded widgets.

60
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.520
Look, now you're going to see it, but it's going to take the full size.

61
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.140
Okay, great.

62
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.730
Now you're going to have the harder tests.

63
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.370
So it says here, right, we can then have the other tests.

64
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.930
And he's going to say so to.

65
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.990
Okay.

66
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.790
The key.

67
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.430
Here you can see the value.

68
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.230
Right.

69
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.580
Okay.

70
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.540
Now as well, you're going to have the other test again is going to see you as the.

71
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.910
He is the.

72
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.100
Okay.

73
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.300
We can just use yesterday.

74
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.920
For now, we just do it this way.

75
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.260
Okay.

76
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.410
He's got you and s.

77
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.770
Okay, great.

78
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.320
Now, once we can do, we can give a little space between this and this Nazi's attitude.

79
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.010
That's another way we thought using this size box is using this piece of widgets.

80
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.350
Okay.

81
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.740
Now over here, we can use the spacer.

82
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.030
Okay.

83
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.400
The actual color and see.

84
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.320
Okay.

85
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.120
You can see now, it's now very small.

86
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.420
Okay.

87
00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.560
And now we can grab this row with the paddle drop which are then.

88
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.600
Okay.

89
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.870
We can just go with ten for all sides.

90
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.040
Okay.

91
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.020
Go check it out.

92
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.510
Okay.

93
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.530
That we can give space between this and this.

94
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.269
Okay.

95
00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.910
So.

96
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.339
Over here.

97
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.170
You can just use the size box.

98
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.230
Weeks of five.

99
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.340
Okay.

100
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.000
Okay.

101
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.690
Great.

102
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.880
Now we can then tie this.

103
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.130
Gives his thigh.

104
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.790
This time.

105
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:58.110
You can increase the font size to 17, and so each color and font suite is going to be font weeds.

106
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.200
Doug Vogt.

107
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.590
Okay.

108
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.470
Addiction killer.

109
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.150
And save.

110
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.870
Okay.

111
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.820
Now for this as well.

112
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:21.620
You can use this to visit any test site and you can see fonts we can just use.

113
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.000
Go ahead.

114
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.400
We can we can need you for like that and just say fonts.

115
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.920
Wait.

116
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.430
There's going to be France with.

117
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.240
The W 700 wouldn't want it to be that boat.

118
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.540
Okay.

119
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.890
Okay.

120
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.610
Great.

121
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.080
Now what you can as well do is we can do is tide is button.

122
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.470
Okay.

123
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.730
Now go to the elevated button.

124
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.560
This elevated button has a property known as Ty.

125
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.420
It's going to be elevated.

126
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.970
What's in Dodd's pie from.

127
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.510
Okay.

128
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.940
Now, first of all, we can give some rounded shape to this so we can see this ship.

129
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.830
This is going to be rounded.

130
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.010
Rectangle border.

131
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.470
So now we can pass whatever.

132
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.070
Yes, we can say whatever our radius.

133
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.600
That's a killer of eight.

134
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.090
Okay.

135
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.050
I got you to come over as well.

136
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.120
And this culture and this.

137
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.810
Okay.

138
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.500
Great.

139
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.990
Now we can change the color of this button.

140
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.600
First of all, added to cover.

141
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.400
So is no expense.

142
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.970
Okay.

143
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.410
Now it's in the.

144
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.120
Elevator.

145
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.400
This time for a ride, you can see.

146
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.260
This widget is here so you can.

147
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.980
There's a primary.

148
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.540
There's going to be colors.

149
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.960
That's black.

150
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.360
Okay.

151
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.940
There is culture and this.

152
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.040
Okay.

153
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.640
Great.

154
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.220
Great.

155
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.980
Okay.

156
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.610
Okay.

157
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.290
Great.

158
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.220
No.

159
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.180
You can do some styling to this sty test tie.

160
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.620
We can just say fun.

161
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.040
Sweet.

162
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.820
Fun.

163
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.120
Sweet to be you.

164
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.680
500.

165
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.130
Okay.

166
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.180
Did you call?

167
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.000
Okay.

168
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.990
Great.

169
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.710
Probably in the future.

170
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.790
Regional tide is better, but for now I think we are good.

171
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.710
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
