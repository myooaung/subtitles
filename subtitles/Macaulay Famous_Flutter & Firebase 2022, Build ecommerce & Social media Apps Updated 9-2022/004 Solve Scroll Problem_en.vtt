00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.700
Now, recently I have added another product, but currently I'm unable to scroll.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.920
So in this lecture, we are going to resolve this.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.520
Okay.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.740
Now, to do this, we have to head back to Our Vinci Code and then the gallery directory.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.440
And then you can see we have this gallery, right, main gallery.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.200
And what we simply have to do is to get rid of this single child, scroll view a light and use control

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.860
and then remove this widgets.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.590
Okay, now default.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.680
The staggered grid view is going to have that single child scroll view.

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.430
Right.

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.840
So, Adam, it is like we are requesting for the opposite.

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.360
Now use control needs to save.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.760
And we are then going to be able to screw this.

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.620
Okay.

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.730
Wait for this.

18
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.170
Okay.

19
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.650
And you can see we are then able to scroll.

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.660
Right.

21
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.440
You can see defaults.

22
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.090
We have this scroll direction and default.

23
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.540
It is said to assist that vertical.

24
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.240
Right.

25
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:25.330
So we really do not need that single child scroll view because it is going to allow multiple widgets

26
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.250
or multiple products for sure.

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.710
So it has that single child scroll V already and you can see currently we are.

28
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.420
We are able to screw.

29
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.600
Right.

30
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.210
Okay.

31
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.850
And we are also going to do this for the store.

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.950
And this store, you can see.

33
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.770
Although here we are not able to scroll, so we have to head back to the store.

34
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.300
Screen, star screen.

35
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.940
And.

36
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.860
You can see it via.

37
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.660
We are.

38
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.420
Where?

39
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.830
Where are you?

40
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.610
Sorry, this is store.

41
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.110
We have that within the minor directory minus screen directory and this store and.

42
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.530
You can see we also have the single child view via, like I said, default.

43
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.500
The staggered grid view has the single child scroll view, right?

44
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.460
That is default by using the staggered grid view.

45
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.980
We are already going to be able to scroll.

46
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.490
So no need of adding the single child scroll view because what's the single child scroll view basically

47
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.250
do is it will enable the user being able to scroll that page.

48
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.300
Now like I said, the staggered grid view already have that functionality of that of the single child

49
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.070
scroll view.

50
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.110
So adding it again is more like telling it to do the opposite.

51
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.880
That is, we do not want to be able to scroll.

52
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.770
Okay, so now we have to alight and use control dots and remove this widgets.

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.910
It's unnecessary now.

54
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.400
Okay.

55
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.010
And hopefully I have no errors.

56
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.300
If you do, you can do well to let me know.

57
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.530
Okay.

58
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.480
You can see we are able to scroll now.

59
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.390
Okay.

60
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.340
We also have to do that for the rest of the gallery.

61
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.510
Okay.

62
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.340
And back to the gallery screen.

63
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.340
Electronics.

64
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.780
And Via.

65
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.500
Remove this widget.

66
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.100
And use control.

67
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.890
Try to save and force use.

68
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.520
We move this widget.

69
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.540
Okay.

70
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.750
And for women.

71
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.490
Okay.

72
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.430
And remove this we get.

73
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.940
Okay.

74
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.830
His content is safe.

75
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.500
And I think we also do need to satisfy.

76
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.700
Okay.

77
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.430
Now click on this and now we are able to scroll.

78
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:25.430
Click on this link and please, if you do have an error, please do also let me know and I'm fully available

79
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.930
to support you and answer all your questions.

80
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.830
And I think this is basically what we needed to do.

81
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.940
And now we can have lots of products and we won't have any issue with the scroll.

82
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.210
Okay, guys.
