00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.140
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.120
In this lecture, we are going to improve on this code.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.900
Now, what we can do is we can create a list to store the main category item.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.060
Now to do this, we have to go to the utilities directory and then the category underscore list.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.440
So that file and I'm going to do this right at the top, I'm just going to paste this code and I think

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.420
this is very familiar to you.

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:38.190
You can see basically I created a label called Main Category and you can see all this accessed.

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.920
So definitely it is a type of string and you can see it is within a list.

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.770
So you can see it is a type of list.

11
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.790
Okay.

12
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.370
And what we also have to do is in the upload products, we can then rename this.

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.720
Vrabel.

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.580
We have, I think we call its main category, but we can just rename this to say main category and value.

15
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.750
Okay.

16
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.100
And.

17
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.980
Value.

18
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay.

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.810
And.

20
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.130
Value.

21
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.860
Okay.

22
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.210
Sounds good.

23
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.040
And now what we can do is we can get rid of this list we have over a year.

24
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.660
Get rid of it.

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.110
And now we can then map over each item we have on this list.

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.990
On this list.

27
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.340
That is the men, women, electronics, accessories, shoes, human guiding and beauty kits and blacks.

28
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.770
So what we can do is to map over each item and then display them.

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.730
Okay.

30
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.790
To do this, we have to call the main category.

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.240
Okay.

32
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.990
Over here, we have to say, man.

33
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.020
Category.

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.720
Then thoughts map to go over each item we have in the list and over you click on this.

35
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.640
Sorry, over in this you can see it is a type of dropdown menu.

36
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.390
So we can just copy to this path over here.

37
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.430
Copy and paste this right here.

38
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.380
Okay, great.

39
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.640
If you don't know what he is referring to, the he is basically referring to the values we have in this

40
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.500
list called main category.

41
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.820
He is basically referring to the the men, women, electronics, accessories, shoes, home magazine,

42
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.320
beauty kits and bags.

43
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.740
So that's what he is basically referring to.

44
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.430
Okay.

45
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.460
Now, instead of using this our function, we could get rid of this and use this type of function.

46
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.180
And now we can then return drop.

47
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.970
Drop.

48
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.090
Drop down menu item.

49
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.750
Okay.

50
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.410
And he's asking for the child.

51
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.020
The child is going to be a test widget and now we can pass the he.

52
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.160
Right.

53
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.860
And it also needs this value and we can also pass the he.

54
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.070
Okay.

55
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.160
And yeah, we have to convert this to a list by saying dot to list and over here we need to train the

56
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.630
comma.

57
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.980
Okay.

58
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.200
How to start this?

59
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.200
I think this is more cleaner.

60
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.080
You can see currently we have just one drop down, right?

61
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.360
So this is going to loop over each category is going to look over each item we have in the main category

62
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.050
list.

63
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.410
Okay.

64
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.120
Let's go check this out and upload.

65
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.890
Okay.

66
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.000
Click on this.

67
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.860
You can see we have the women sorry, the men, women, electronics, accessories, shoes, homemade

68
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.140
guiding beauty kits and bags.

69
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.710
And click on kids because you can see kids over here.

70
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.610
Sounds good.

71
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.420
You can just take some time to to copy this.

72
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.620
Okay.

73
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.930
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
