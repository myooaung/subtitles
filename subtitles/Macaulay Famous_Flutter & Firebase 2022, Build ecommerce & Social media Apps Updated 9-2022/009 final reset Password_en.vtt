00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.660
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.450
That last lecture we created is function.

4
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.650
We forgot password generator.

5
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.360
We said we want to send the password.

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.650
We sent link to the user.

7
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.180
If only the email address is not empty.

8
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.870
Okay.

9
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.610
Now, in this lecture, we're going to call this function more like a network.

10
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.360
Okay.

11
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.660
Now, before they ask you to do this right, ask you to implement this function, like put it to work,

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.020
okay?

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.009
If you are not able to do it for some reasons, it is fine.

14
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.020
I believe in consistency.

15
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.170
I believe as we continue to do it, you're going to master the process.

16
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.530
Okay.

17
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.170
Now before we move on to the focus on small screen, what we can as well is over here.

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.700
If the.

19
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.660
If the password we said because we sense to the user that is a user associated email address we as well

20
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.470
order prints.

21
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.730
So just to the screen so you can separate your.

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.310
Your.

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.470
Password.

24
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.030
Well, we can't just.

25
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.010
A recent switch said link was then sent to.

26
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.180
Your email.

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.980
Okay.

28
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.550
Great.

29
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.230
So now going to call this function.

30
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.690
Now to do this, I'm going to go to the.

31
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.860
Forget password.

32
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.710
Screen right now.

33
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.900
They're not to have access to the value.

34
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.400
They're going to create the controller.

35
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.530
So there.

36
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.850
They're going to have a controller.

37
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.490
So there's going to be finer than you can call this email.

38
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.100
Control.

39
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.250
It's going to be quite a test.

40
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.750
Editing.

41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.020
Controller.

42
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.620
Okay.

43
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.140
Now we can also specify a type.

44
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.570
It just.

45
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.740
It's it's in control.

46
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.930
Okay, great.

47
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.350
Now you're going to bind this to the field, so you're going to go to get the types in value.

48
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.560
So there's going to be controller.

49
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.330
So in there.

50
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.150
The tests failed.

51
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.510
Right.

52
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.270
So this ability controller is going to be on this email controller.

53
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.480
So it is listed for the user inputs.

54
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.500
Okay.

55
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.220
Now.

56
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.270
What are going to do next is.

57
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.640
They're going to create a function which have seen before.

58
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.830
So we can see.

59
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.710
For God's.

60
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.980
Password.

61
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.100
I saw it.

62
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.540
Okay.

63
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.650
Now, looking to pass into a sink or a.

64
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.400
Okay.

65
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.530
Then you're going to say what's?

66
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.260
Controller call it, then it's going to be forgot.

67
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.550
We've got password rights.

68
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.940
Okay.

69
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.890
For the email.

70
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.440
It is going to be on this call.

71
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.460
On this email.

72
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.270
Controller.

73
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.730
But yes, that's a good value.

74
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.020
Okay, great.

75
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.590
Now we can store the results in a variable call address.

76
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.090
It's going to be a type of drink.

77
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.780
Then we can't wait for it.

78
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.360
Okay.

79
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.790
I know you've seen this before, right?

80
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.370
Okay.

81
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.510
Now what they're going to do next is we are going to check.

82
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.330
If there is error or not.

83
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.000
So we can't use the delay.

84
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.470
We can't say if race is equal.

85
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.650
They're just going to say is equal to success.

86
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.860
Okay.

87
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.930
Remarkable for raising, not equal.

88
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.420
So they're going to say equal to success.

89
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.180
If it is equal to success, then also it's on.

90
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.690
A show.

91
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.690
Snow.

92
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.769
What it contains.

93
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.550
You can just see.

94
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.870
Link has been sent to the email address.

95
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.830
Okay.

96
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.880
Now you can see we have in this era what you can just do to avoid this.

97
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.560
I'm going to switch to the stateful widgets.

98
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.150
And what are these control dots?

99
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.560
Okay.

100
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.790
Switch to convert substitutions.

101
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.200
Okay.

102
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.450
Grades.

103
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.230
The semicolon.

104
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.250
Okay.

105
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.160
Now if there is a sequel to success or to say, see lick as we've said, or to provide this number which

106
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.730
is give to say link as with sense to your to the.

107
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.740
Email address.

108
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.970
Else.

109
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.080
The retired slugger is retired.

110
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.490
Snack bar.

111
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.060
Sure is.

112
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.320
Sure.

113
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.010
Snack bar.

114
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.530
For the contents.

115
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.350
There's going to be research a chance to hear a.

116
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.330
Okay, Control, this is safe.

117
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.830
Okay, so it is basically it.

118
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.200
Now we're going to use this formula which we created.

119
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.560
Right.

120
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.640
So we're going to go to the first all as what's in digital rights.

121
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.330
It's.

122
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.870
Think so?

123
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.270
Okay.

124
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.270
So we'll take a step further out of this with a in.

125
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.460
So when this contract does.

126
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.080
The apple tree gets the happiness rates equal because you rub this with something known as the gesture

127
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.530
tic tac toe which is similar to the inkwell.

128
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.840
Get a Zelda or to.

129
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.420
Can I just get rid of this uncle for God's?

130
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.320
Forgot password and that's all.

131
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.780
Get rid of this sketch just now to save.

132
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.190
So this is basically.

133
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.490
It's.

134
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.470
Right.

135
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.600
Okay.

136
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.570
Great.

137
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.350
Now we can just also start this year not to send it out to save others and save twice.

138
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.200
Okay.

139
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.310
Okay.

140
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.830
Now they're going to try to.

141
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.340
Okay.

142
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.170
Okay.

143
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.790
Click on the forgot password.

144
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.780
Okay.

145
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.940
Now, again, I'm going to try to give him the address of a.

146
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.000
Let's think.

147
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.260
Cali.

148
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.520
Families.

149
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.030
I don't really know if have this.

150
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.480
In the ashes as she sits in the knockouts.

151
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.000
That's come back for God.

152
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.600
Bless it.

153
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.070
I don't think this is clickable.

154
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:16.450
It's.

155
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.940
Okay.

156
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.660
I'm just going to check my stamina.

157
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.700
Okay.

158
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.750
Okay.

159
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.300
A network error occurred.

160
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.870
Okay.

161
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.140
Now think about network issues.

162
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:45.930
What this is going to work for you now after this probably is going to say no user no user record found

163
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.090
it's with the email address is not associated to any accounts.

164
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.210
So I'm just going to try to on the will.

165
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.950
Well for dinner.

166
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.480
I think I'm having the talk issues.

167
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.150
Well, it's definitely it is going to work out.

168
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.810
So what we're going to do is we're going to try this yourself.

169
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.640
So make sure you put in the address that is associated to any of your accounts.

170
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.690
Right.

171
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.490
I think I click this many times, which is why that's why this is popping out so many times.

172
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.870
Okay, so now you're gonna add anything address associated to account, then you're going to check your

173
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.130
email.

174
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:24.330
Okay.

175
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.320
Now I'm going to try to do this behind the scene.

176
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.660
If there's any error, we can just do to get about.

177
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.690
Hopefully there's never to be any here or.

178
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.490
I think this is perfect.

179
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.429
Okay.

180
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.370
So you're going to try to do this yourself now?

181
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.650
You're going to try to test it out.

182
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.230
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
