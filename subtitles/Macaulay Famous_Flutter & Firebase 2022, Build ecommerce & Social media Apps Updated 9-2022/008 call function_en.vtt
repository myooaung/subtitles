00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.780
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.410
Walker In this lecture, we're going to call this functional card fetch paradox.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.820
Okay.

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.690
But before then, over here, we had made a mistake.

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.230
Okay.

6
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.110
Now, what we can just do is we can get rid of this for now and then say ten dots.

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.630
Zero.

8
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.360
Okay.

9
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.780
Harder to recover.

10
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.210
Okay.

11
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.750
Now, you're going to need to make sure all your fields over here are what you have.

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.910
Over here.

13
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.770
You're going to get the backstage area.

14
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.460
Okay.

15
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.240
Now you're going to need to call this super.

16
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.900
Okay.

17
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.190
But before then, we're going to need to change the image source.

18
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.270
Okay.

19
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.590
To do this, we're going to need to go first to the fields and use the assets.

20
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.050
Image is going to be a network image.

21
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
Right because we are currently fetching for a rare the Internet.

22
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.870
Okay.

23
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.450
As well.

24
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.620
I didn't need to do that for the design for each put up as well.

25
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.010
Okay.

26
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.960
That's I think already I've done that.

27
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.660
You need to have that.

28
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.330
Okay.

29
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.379
I'm just going to do it again.

30
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.700
That's work.

31
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.640
Image.

32
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.990
Okay, great.

33
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.910
Now, the next thing now is to.

34
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.170
Okay, so now this.

35
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.580
Now.

36
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.980
Okay.

37
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.920
Okay.

38
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.630
The next thing to do is to call the function.

39
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.870
Okay.

40
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.070
We're going to call this function.

41
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.200
Okay.

42
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.440
Just think how to.

43
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.980
Save this fire as well.

44
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.070
Okay.

45
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.500
We're going to call this function in our main screen.

46
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.170
So it's going to become available in all the flies.

47
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.650
Okay.

48
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.210
We're going to call this in the home screen.

49
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.590
Okay.

50
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.610
Now what we can't just do is on screen.

51
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.830
Okay.

52
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.250
I think we just need to copy.

53
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.870
That.

54
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.250
Okay.

55
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.500
From the field screen and.

56
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.990
Okay.

57
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.800
I think we need to copy this.

58
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.850
Archer and B and.

59
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.640
We dived as you can't just tap.

60
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.199
It's okay.

61
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.210
Go to the on screen.

62
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.610
And PCs here.

63
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.120
Okay.

64
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.080
Now we have access to that function we just created.

65
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.750
First of all, you're going to need to import this.

66
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.530
Okay.

67
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.510
Okay.

68
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.990
Okay.

69
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.100
Import this.

70
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.520
Okay.

71
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
And now you can see on school projects.

72
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.050
Provider.

73
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.200
Start.

74
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.490
Fetch.

75
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.930
Okay.

76
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.820
Fetch.

77
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.430
I think.

78
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.860
Isn't this.

79
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.050
That's fence.

80
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.760
Products.

81
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.170
Okay.

82
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.690
Currently we have nothing.

83
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.630
We have no products.

84
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.800
Right.

85
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.620
Okay, now let's try two or three studies.

86
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.500
Okay.

87
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.980
Okay.

88
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.420
Okay.

89
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.850
Okay.

90
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.170
Okay.

91
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.570
Okay.

92
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.930
Okay.

93
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.220
Okay.

94
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.780
Okay.

95
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.580
And.

96
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.540
Check it out and see.

97
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.220
The product is now available.

98
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.320
Okay.

99
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.470
It is not okay.

100
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.320
Let's go check if we have any errors.

101
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.380
Okay.

102
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.890
Check.

103
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.540
Okay.

104
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.500
We got no, Haras.

105
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.360
Probably we are calling this in the wrong thigh.

106
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.770
Okay.

107
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.340
It was the check as well for the fields.

108
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.700
Okay.

109
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.690
Okay.

110
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.040
You can see we have the products here, but we don't have it.

111
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.160
Okay, okay, okay.

112
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.750
Okay.

113
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.770
I think it's currently available, but we have to go to a page.

114
00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.980
Okay.

115
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.970
We didn't know how to start this and make sure everything is working as planned.

116
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.960
Okay.

117
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.730
Okay, okay.

118
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.330
It's going to take some time.

119
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.080
Okay.

120
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.500
Okay.

121
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.990
Okay.

122
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.089
Okay.

123
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.930
I think.

124
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.990
Okay, click on this and go back.

125
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.220
Okay.

126
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.010
I think the reason for this is we are calling this in the wrong.

127
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.950
For the so in the wrong I think we should call this and the bottom.

128
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.880
Number.

129
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.490
Five, see?

130
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.780
Okay.

131
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.390
This I think these are our first screenshots.

132
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.950
All our widgets, all via.

133
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.860
Okay.

134
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.580
Culture and the arts.

135
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.320
And.

136
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.190
And I just had this.

137
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.850
You see?

138
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.350
Okay.

139
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.380
Okay.

140
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.800
Okay.

141
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.240
Okay.

142
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.670
Okay.

143
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.790
Just starts.

144
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.850
And see the part that's going to be available with with AK.

145
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.590
Okay.

146
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.760
Go back to this.

147
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.930
Come back.

148
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.910
Okay.

149
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.200
I think the paradox is all the valuable and fit screen.

150
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.490
Right.

151
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.220
And I think is.

152
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.960
I think his work in us is better.

153
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.610
Okay.

154
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.370
Okay.

155
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.610
Okay.

156
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.480
We started this.

157
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.230
Okay.

158
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.530
Is Oliver in this play that was in the full screen?

159
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.520
Okay, so what we can just do is we can just simply copy this.

160
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.280
And then go to the design for each product and then.

161
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.940
Well, you're going to need to pay this.

162
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.320
Okay.

163
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.350
You know how to start this and see.

164
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.320
Okay.

165
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.890
Okay.

166
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.390
Okay.

167
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.340
But you start in.

168
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.590
Okay.

169
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.650
Now you can see, Karen, you are fetching the product from the Italian.

170
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.930
Okay.

171
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.640
Okay.

172
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.160
I think for some reasons it is not available at that time.

173
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.410
Okay.

174
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.430
I'm just gonna look for a way to fill that up or probably is okay.

175
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.940
I don't know.

176
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.900
But was going to look for a way to figure that out.

177
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.180
Okay.

178
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.600
Now let's check if everything is working correctly.

179
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.250
I think I'm having some network issues.

180
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.770
So that's why that product is not been.

181
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.130
This may.

182
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.500
Okay.

183
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.230
So the check for the field as well.

184
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.230
Okay.

185
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.160
Lucky guy seen in this lecture.
