00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.300
Worker In this lecture, we're going to create your screen and it's basically going to look just like

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.210
the car screen so we can copy most of the codes.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.630
Okay.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.140
Not to do this, we're gonna need to go back to our visa code, and then we're going to create a widget

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.980
right over here.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.820
That's going to be the design for each order, right?

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.430
So this is going to be order of this item then dot, dot.

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.810
You can also have the order screen over the screen star tree.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.040
Okay.

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.550
Order on this course screen and the.

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.340
Okay, now over here.

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.150
We can just create less widgets and order screen.

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.620
On the screen in a via a lights and then use country in dots in order to impart the material out to

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.970
that package and.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.140
Over the widgets rights.

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.330
Or our time.

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.790
Okay.

19
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.290
As well as that list we did and.

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.420
Buy the item and then layer.

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.800
Okay.

22
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.180
Great.

23
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.630
Okay.

24
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.840
No idea of the design for each.

25
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
Cause I to write as gonna look like it is gonna look just like this, like I said.

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.060
So we can.

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.550
We can basically just copy.

28
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.170
The cards item and.

29
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.730
Okay.

30
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.270
Over a year.

31
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.750
Okay.

32
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.410
Over.

33
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.880
Yeah.

34
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.910
From.

35
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.420
This as well.

36
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.770
We're going to make it clickable, right?

37
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.320
So we can copy everything the way.

38
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.230
It.

39
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.290
And here you can see control and see and control.

40
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.350
And B, and I'm going to go back to the.

41
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.080
Or die.

42
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.800
Right.

43
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.200
And we're going to get rid of this.

44
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.220
Sorry.

45
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.250
Get rid.

46
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.070
Oh, this.

47
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.270
And then is this?

48
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.110
Yes.

49
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.400
We're going to get some errors.

50
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.340
First of all, we're just name parts.

51
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.560
This first one, we're not going to be needing.

52
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.990
Most of those like the outskirts are not there.

53
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.010
So can you just get rid of this for now?

54
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.600
Okay.

55
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.040
Click on this area.

56
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.520
Okay.

57
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.890
Get rid of this as well.

58
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.010
Okay.

59
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.250
Click on this link.

60
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.400
We don't need this.

61
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.470
So we can just get rid of the card.

62
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.770
And here.

63
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.850
Okay.

64
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.430
As well.

65
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.620
We don't need this tie to.

66
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.110
Okay.

67
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.350
This is the first rule.

68
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.080
Like you can just get rid of the rule.

69
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.070
Okay.

70
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.110
Okay.

71
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.990
What I'm going to do is I'm on to this or I don't want you to mystically go and get rid of what we need.

72
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.250
Okay.

73
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.740
So I'm going to get rid of this first.

74
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.450
Okay.

75
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:27.530
What you can just do is we can change this to some empty and click on this as well and see.

76
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.590
Okay.

77
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.330
Take on this.

78
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.760
Okay.

79
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.470
Click on this.

80
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.940
Okay.

81
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.390
We can just use something.

82
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.820
Can you say.

83
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.380
Under it for now.

84
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.460
Okay.

85
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.170
As for the title, you can just say Gucci.

86
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.310
Gucci.

87
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.800
Okay.

88
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.100
Okay.

89
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.150
Now you're going to need to get rid of this for now and.

90
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.590
Or the image?

91
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.830
Well, you can guess.

92
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.510
Don't add anything.

93
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.180
Or you can just say.

94
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.660
Access slash images.

95
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.830
Slash I have one, but p.

96
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.470
Angie.

97
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.860
Okay.

98
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.940
I think we have the peaks.

99
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.370
Okay.

100
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.580
And also we can just get rid of this.

101
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.760
Okay.

102
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.380
Now what we can danger is.

103
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.930
What you can then do is to go back to.

104
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.190
The other screen.

105
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.550
Right.

106
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.920
Okay.

107
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.900
Or the screen and.

108
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.350
Or the screen and.

109
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.550
Here.

110
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.710
There again, there is a scaffold rights.

111
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.940
So we have access to loss of properties and.

112
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.090
The scaffold as the body property.

113
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.200
And this is going to be.

114
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.830
I think we need this.

115
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.670
This is going to be the order I tend.

116
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.260
Right.

117
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.450
Okay, great.

118
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.740
Now, what we can do is we can create the navigation folder.

119
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.410
So when the user clicks on.

120
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.960
This.

121
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.070
Border Marauders is going to take the user to the orders.

122
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.850
Okay.

123
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.180
Now, what you can just do is we can make this a name route.

124
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.460
I think you've seen this before, so I'm going to add a static and cast string.

125
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.830
We can just call this route name or you can simply just see it.

126
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.240
And.

127
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.110
It's going to be equal to the radar screen.

128
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.050
That is the name of the route or the screen and this.

129
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.420
Okay.

130
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.610
So I'm trying to not unless they were going to need to do is to let our men do that.

131
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.510
No, no.

132
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.400
This was not what we just did.

133
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.700
Okay.

134
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.380
So to do that over here, we can use country and B and.

135
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.920
Over a year.

136
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.170
We can then say on the screen.

137
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.340
Got it.

138
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.490
And there's going to be contest and our function and it's going to be for the.

139
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.440
Screen.

140
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.540
Okay.

141
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.260
Great.

142
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.540
Is basically it.

143
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.820
And now we're going to go to the provide screen.

144
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.750
Profiles current and.

145
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.050
Thank not products but.

146
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.440
Verify screen digital via and we can use control and be.

147
00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.100
Now.

148
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.930
Let's check for my orders.

149
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.320
Okay.

150
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.260
Okay.

151
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.410
This is it's a.

152
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.300
Okay.

153
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.770
Okay.

154
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.910
Okay.

155
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.480
Is it over?

156
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.690
This is the function of a year, right?

157
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.110
Okay.

158
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.540
So what we can do is.

159
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.960
Now we.

160
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.210
Great.

161
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.590
So you can see we basically wrapped it with a button right.

162
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.090
So there's a least tied to tie to is going to be here.

163
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.500
Yeah.

164
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:41.660
And the lead in is always on the left side.

165
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.450
So you can see it is basically what's in these stories.

166
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.520
So then we navigate our.

167
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.680
Start.

168
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.970
Of contest.

169
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.820
Or you can just see the push name.

170
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.200
So it's going to be a roots and numerals, right?

171
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.550
Okay.

172
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:05.710
You can see it's also to take in the contest and it's going to be I think we call this order.

173
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:07.680
Order.

174
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.640
Field, order.

175
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.070
Screen ID.

176
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.690
Okay.

177
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.320
Okay.

178
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.210
We can just use all three start.

179
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.540
So.

180
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.710
You start this and.

181
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.210
Okay.

182
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.660
Okay.

183
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.080
Okay.

184
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.560
Okay.

185
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.980
Okay.

186
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.400
Okay.

187
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.880
Okay.

188
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.270
Okay.

189
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.690
Okay.

190
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.080
Okay.

191
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.410
Okay.

192
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.950
Okay.

193
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.350
Okay.

194
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.130
Okay, okay.

195
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:28.490
Okay.

196
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.910
Okay.

197
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.380
Take me there.

198
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.370
Take me there.

199
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.220
Ack ack ack ack is done and you can go check it out.

200
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.220
And this will take us back to the whole screen and.

201
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.929
So let's say because of home screen and.

202
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.480
Okay.

203
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.930
And over here, click on it.

204
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.490
You can see that's the order.

205
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.510
And I think for some reasons we are not having the current image location.

206
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.460
You can go check it seminar and see.

207
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.850
Okay.

208
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.150
You look at food.

209
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.490
You can see us images, however.

210
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:10.900
Okay.

211
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.920
So what we can do is to make sure we have the correct spelling.

212
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.300
Okay, I think there's going to crash your app.

213
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.430
And I showed you how to get rid of that, too, whenever you have an era.

214
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.530
He said, Well, of course your OP was just going to try that in your visa code, you know, debacle.

215
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.080
So sorry.

216
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.440
So to do that, if you have not done that, you can click on this and you're going to see on court assertions

217
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.440
and you're going to need to check this default.

218
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.280
It's going to be checked.

219
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.640
So you're going to uncheck this and this.

220
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.030
Okay.

221
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.610
Okay.

222
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:51.150
So what we can do is they're going to go back to the design for each order item and it's just located

223
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.170
in the widgets.

224
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.400
Let's think.

225
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.060
But I came and.

226
00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.980
There's no collapse.

227
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.800
There's I think we have a lot of fires now.

228
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.160
Okay.

229
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.170
And the assets and.

230
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.070
Images.

231
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.380
This check for the river.

232
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.190
However, one I think we do have.

233
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.670
That's okay.

234
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.170
However.

235
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.640
Okay.

236
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.440
Okay.

237
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.960
Arriver just gonna check.

238
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.490
To make sure.

239
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.030
Okay.

240
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.870
Assets.

241
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.010
Images are of a.

242
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.050
Driver.

243
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.410
Okay.

244
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.310
The location is where?

245
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.790
Assess images.

246
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:58.460
Assess images and a camera to figure out what we can do, that we can try to see the copy, the location,

247
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.050
countries see and.

248
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.170
So.

249
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.090
Or I came and then use control and be.

250
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.700
And then there's sorry, there's not going to be a network hemorrhage, but what now is going to be

251
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.090
hard said so forget assets in which.

252
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.600
Okay.

253
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.580
This should definitely work out okay.

254
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.920
Okay.

255
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.140
You can see now, we really don't need this.

256
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.320
This ship feed is subsidized and.

257
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.070
We don't need this.

258
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.410
So what we can do is.

259
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.170
Okay.

260
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:40.770
Okay.

261
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.890
This is the second row, right?

262
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.150
So this is the row.

263
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.480
This rule contains the substance and.

264
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.440
What?

265
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:58.140
So we can just get rid of this virus and use control nets to make sure we're not deleting something.

266
00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.490
Those.

267
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:58.910
Okay.

268
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.590
Okay then we don't as well.

269
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.940
We don't need this.

270
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.380
Right.

271
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:05.680
Okay.

272
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.470
So what we can do, this is it's okay.

273
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.700
Get rid of this rule.

274
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.420
Can't see its answer.

275
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.610
Okay.

276
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.440
Okay.

277
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.010
Great.

278
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.970
Yeah, we need this because we have no ability to remove for our order.

279
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.630
Okay, now, really, we don't need just one item, right?

280
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.910
So what you're going to do is.

281
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.300
Over the pro five.

282
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:40.370
Sorry, the cut screen rights cards cut screener does not do this quickly.

283
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.410
Cuts screen.

284
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.280
Cuts Screen.

285
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.090
Cuts Screen.

286
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.900
Cuts screen.

287
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.920
Can't.

288
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.330
Okay.

289
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.170
Digital via.

290
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.730
We can.

291
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.030
As well.

292
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.500
Use this right.

293
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.000
You can use this.

294
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.730
This view, the view there.

295
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.850
You've seen this before.

296
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.340
Okay.

297
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.950
Already know what it does.

298
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.730
We are more like, who wants to look over each other?

299
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.730
I say we have.

300
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.370
Okay, so we're going to go back to the audio screen or the screen.

301
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.110
So all the screen and.

302
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.720
Then it sort of did something to get rid of this and then this.

303
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.990
Now over this, we're going to get rid of this and just say we need five and.

304
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.710
We okay?

305
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.710
So what we can do is we can get rid of this as well.

306
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.240
Kids.

307
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.010
You can just get rid of all this.

308
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.300
Everything inside here.

309
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.720
And say, we want to return to the item.

310
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.420
Okay.

311
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.190
Great odds, the studies.

312
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.430
Okay.

313
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.910
Okay.

314
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.390
Okay.

315
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:02.870
Okay.

316
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.320
Okay.

317
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.740
Okay.

318
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.160
Okay.

319
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.240
Okay.

320
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.790
Okay.

321
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.770
I'll go check it out.

322
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.660
Is going to take us back now and we can.

323
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.060
Okay.

324
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.410
Okay.

325
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:11.710
Okay.

326
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.980
Okay.

327
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.670
Take us back.

328
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:13.650
Okay.

329
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.980
Profile and.

330
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.350
We can click on others.

331
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.490
You can see we have five.

332
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.110
Right.

333
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.550
You can as well hard.

334
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.200
And Harbor for this.

335
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:28.500
Okay.

336
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.150
I think that should be your assignments.

337
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.720
You're going to need to add an Abbott and investiture regular card to the adjustment.

338
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.020
Yeah.

339
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.740
Okay, guys.

340
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.530
See you in the next lecture.
