1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.140
Ice work.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.390
In this lecture, we are going to have up to three types of AI.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.720
One is going to be for the preparing section.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.360
The other is going to be for the shipping.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.110
And the third is going to be for the delivery.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.820
To do this, we have to go to the seller, order screen and in order to use Tableau.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.880
The first step is to wrap this scaffold with something known as default type controller.

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.140
So what you have to do is to alight and use controller.

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.270
Sorry.

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.190
Highlight and use controller and then wrap with widgets.

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.550
And it is something known as default.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.730
They fought sub.

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.040
But.

14
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.410
I an octopus addiction.

15
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.800
Okay.

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.470
Default tab controller.

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.840
Now within the default tab controller, it has a property known as land, which is basically referring

18
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.950
to how many tab we need.

19
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.350
Okay.

20
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.610
And like I said, we are going to be needing Siri tabs so we can then say Siri.

21
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.190
Okay.

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.800
And now it's in the harbor.

23
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.660
It has a property known as bottom.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.630
Okay.

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.240
And for the bottom, it's going to take you something known as Zorba.

26
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.220
Tabar.

27
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.460
It has a property known as tops that is least of types.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.930
And now we can have the first tub.

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.830
Okay.

30
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.370
Now it's in the tab.

31
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:57.590
It has the property known as child for the child is going to be a test widget and this is going to be

32
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.580
preparing.

33
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.680
Preparing.

34
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.200
And this is this is not going to be seen.

35
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.660
So what we can do is you can give this a style by Haydn style.

36
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.190
And this is going to be test.

37
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.240
STI.

38
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay.

39
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.090
The star.

40
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.070
Okay.

41
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.980
And now we can give this a color or maybe colors.

42
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.830
So he call us.

43
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.360
The black.

44
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.190
Okay.

45
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.760
We can then come over there.

46
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.990
And first of all, we cannot wait to see what you are missing.

47
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.960
I think we are missing an additional parenthesis and now we can copy.

48
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.040
This tab.

49
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.400
Okay.

50
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.660
Copy.

51
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.050
And we are going to pace this and this is going to say ship in.

52
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.640
Shipping.

53
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.000
And lastly, we are going to face this.

54
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.670
And this is going to say.

55
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.060
The levered.

56
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.880
Okay.

57
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.130
And this are the three types we need.

58
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.100
And now we need the contents of the we need the content for each tab right now to do this within the

59
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.940
scaffold.

60
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.780
It has a property known as body and this is going to be something known as TAB.

61
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.580
But then the.

62
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.930
Okay.

63
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.640
It's going to take multiple contents.

64
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.070
So it has this property, it has the children as its property.

65
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:55.420
And for the now, the first contents can be a center widgets and we can then have a child.

66
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.550
Child, which is going to be a test widget.

67
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.500
And this is going to save preparing.

68
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.900
And now we can copy this.

69
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.840
And paste.

70
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.620
This is going to be for the shipping.

71
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.160
Chip in.

72
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.390
And lastly.

73
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.670
This is going to be for the delivered.

74
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.740
The levered.

75
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.120
Okay is control and has now to save.

76
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.040
And.

77
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.090
Go check this out.

78
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.810
Or maybe you could alter your stats.

79
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.430
You can see this is the preparing and this is the content for it.

80
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.170
And this is the shipping.

81
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.910
And deliver it.

82
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.710
Okay.

83
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.570
Now, instead of all this, we can create the screens.

84
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.430
So back to the dashboard screens.

85
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.960
What you can do is you can create a new folder for this, or we can just go ahead and create it within

86
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.240
the dashboard screens.

87
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.210
Okay.

88
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.250
The first screen we need is the preparing underscore screen.

89
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.910
Then, though, that.

90
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.840
And we can just go ahead and use this the less we judge for now.

91
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.450
And preparing.

92
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.510
Screen.

93
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.860
Okay.

94
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.230
No highlights and is concerned about the import.

95
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:43.530
So I think we have to import the material, the dots in order to have access to some lots more property.

96
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.190
Okay.

97
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.540
For now, we can just wrap this with a sensor widget.

98
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.430
And we can then have a child.

99
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.090
Test.

100
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.700
And this is going to say preparing.

101
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.100
Okay.

102
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.070
And we can just copy this.

103
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.190
And back to the dashboard folder.

104
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.630
Dashboard screen folder.

105
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.450
We can then create another screen shipping on the screen.

106
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.260
Then the dot.

107
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.480
And this.

108
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.830
Now what we have to do is to change this to ship in.

109
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.950
Screen.

110
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.270
Okay.

111
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.350
And then I'm going to rename this test to say Shipman.

112
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.420
Okay.

113
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.560
And lastly, for the delivered.

114
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.960
On this score screen.

115
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.070
Though that.

116
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.550
Okay.

117
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.710
Delivered screen.

118
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.080
And now we have to end this delivered.

119
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.610
Okay.

120
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.240
And now back to the cellar store screen.

121
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:08.550
We then have to get rid of the sensor widget and then we can call the sorry, the preparing.

122
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.650
Preparing screen.

123
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.220
Okay.

124
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.500
And get rid of this.

125
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.180
We can then call the ship in.

126
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.340
Ship and screen.

127
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.540
And get rid of this.

128
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.950
And now we can call the delivered.

129
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.490
Delivered screen.

130
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.670
Okay.

131
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:47.780
And what we have to do is we have to restart this and it's going to work as expected.

132
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.180
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
