00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.780
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
Walker, in this lecture, you're going to create an hour button, so you're going to be able to go

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.840
back.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.890
Okay.

5
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.160
Now, to do this, I'm going to go to the detail page.

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.520
Then they're going to use Control and they select this white.

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.230
Okay.

8
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.920
Now, in the last lecture we have.

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.790
Is that right?

10
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.410
We have this stuck.

11
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.460
The reason for this talk is because we want to be able to place a widget atop this image.

12
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.160
Now what is stuck?

13
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.030
We have the first chart, which is a container, which is simply this image.

14
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.660
Right.

15
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
So now you're going to be able to place another widget on top of this image.

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.740
First of all, over here.

17
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.950
Rather than need to hide it through the cover, I'll try to save enough to give this a very cool format.

18
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.090
Okay.

19
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.840
Now, over this container as well, they're going to give it to the cameras up.

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.080
Then they're going to have the position that all the mess we get is going to be placed.

21
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:05.830
Okay.

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.890
Now for the tide, it's going to be a container because it'll give some cool background star to the

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.930
horror icon.

24
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.940
Okay, then we can then have a child.

25
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.020
It's going to be icon.

26
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.800
Icon, which it then is going to be icons.

27
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.360
That rule.

28
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.930
On this score back.

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.620
I always.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.190
Okay.

31
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.780
Now use culture and this to save.

32
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.360
And go check it out.

33
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.360
Okay.

34
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.340
We really can say this.

35
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.770
First of all, I'm going to change the color to colors that's black.

36
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.370
Okay.

37
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.110
Okay.

38
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.260
And well, they're going to say let's.

39
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.790
15 and top.

40
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.430
Christine.

41
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.350
Okay.

42
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.039
And go check it out.

43
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.570
Okay.

44
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.550
You can sit over here.

45
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.070
We are just going to take this.

46
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.110
This 20.

47
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.160
Okay, I think.

48
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.800
So you can see that the Berkeley.

49
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.440
Well, we're going to use that.

50
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.840
Like it does.

51
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.210
You just have to do till you're satisfied.

52
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.670
Okay.

53
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.200
Then I think 25 should be okay.

54
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.190
Okay.

55
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.800
Okay.

56
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.360
Now we can then hide some background seeds.

57
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.200
That was the reason for the call to the right.

58
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.530
Okay.

59
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.180
So we can have a decoration box decoration.

60
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.040
Works as decoration.

61
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.730
And color is the colors that white.

62
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.310
Okay.

63
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.460
Okay.

64
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.830
Now we can see a ship here.

65
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.070
No, what this does is the box ship.

66
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.430
The ship.

67
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.050
So looks ship.

68
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.280
The sickle.

69
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.950
Okay.

70
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.590
Okay.

71
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.520
And now we can give you part into this.

72
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.170
But in the hedge, it says as it says.

73
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.550
So it's all sides or it's.

74
00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.920
Okay.

75
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.230
Okay.

76
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.880
I think this is way too vague.

77
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.550
There's going to see five and see.

78
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.230
Okay.

79
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.720
I think this is way too white.

80
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.040
So you can see Todd.

81
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.110
Sweet opacity.

82
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.520
Of maybe zero.

83
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.000
That's.

84
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.780
605.

85
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.700
Jenna Coleman as well.

86
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.140
Okay.

87
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.750
Okay.

88
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.240
Great.

89
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.630
It is going to go.

90
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.990
It's.

91
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.820
Let's try to.

92
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.160
And see what it does.

93
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.810
Okay.

94
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.730
We're just going to go with five.

95
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.070
I think five is okay.

96
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.440
Those are transparent is going to be.

97
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.260
Okay.

98
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.570
Okay.

99
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.260
Great.

100
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.310
Right.

101
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.720
Okay.

102
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.660
Now, what you're going to do next is because rob this container or we can rob this icon.

103
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.290
Right.

104
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.700
We can wrap it to the boxes that you contact the cable.

105
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.250
Why doesn't the wrap this container?

106
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.910
So even if we click on this.

107
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.910
Site.

108
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.860
It's going to take us to sticker to trigger the button.

109
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.160
Right.

110
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.490
Okay.

111
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.510
So you can just grab this container light.

112
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.890
In cultural and arts groups.

113
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:52.230
This was a tattoo we did away rap, which we get the regular updates with an equal S.O.S. Equal, which

114
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.560
acts.

115
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.920
Okay.

116
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.980
Then on tap you can see society on tap property.

117
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.270
Okay.

118
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.400
That is going to be none of the gate or that's.

119
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.140
That, of course, is that we're just going to say dots.

120
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.690
But by doing this is going to take us back to the previous page.

121
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.110
Okay.

122
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.420
Now use controls to save.

123
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.610
Okay.

124
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.990
And now I can click on this.

125
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.830
Okay.

126
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.490
You can see.

127
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.700
Just on this, you don't really need to click on the how.

128
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.490
Well, that's okay.

129
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.310
Click on this.

130
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.610
Okay.

131
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.380
Work on this.

132
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.430
Okay, great.

133
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.210
Right.

134
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.780
Okay.

135
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.680
Okay, guys.

136
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000
See you in in this picture.
