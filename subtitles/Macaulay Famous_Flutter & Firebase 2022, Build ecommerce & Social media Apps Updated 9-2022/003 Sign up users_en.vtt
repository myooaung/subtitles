00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.450
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:02.940
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.390
Now, this lecture, we're going to create new functionality to sign up.

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.140
Users know more about the asset that the controls order is are going to create in our logic.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.500
Oh, we're going to be creating the focus it is of our job, such as signing off users, logging in

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.200
users, logging out users and holders.

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay, now what you're going to do now is what is controller's order?

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.010
We are going to create a new PHI and we're going to call this by hot bed or this cool controller.

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790
Then the station which is dot dot.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.030
Okay.

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.780
Now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a class and can call this class or.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.800
Controller.

13
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.760
Okay, great.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.710
Now, the next thing you're going to do is create is a function.

15
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.420
Okay.

16
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.200
What we can do is we can just how the call that's on this.

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.720
You're going to create emotions inside of users.

18
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.990
Right.

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.010
So once you can.

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.790
Yes.

21
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.250
Galleries, we can see a portion.

22
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.310
So sign of users.

23
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.750
Okay.

24
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.550
Now the nest is created to function.

25
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.250
We can call this function sign.

26
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.120
Sign of users.

27
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.930
Okay.

28
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.820
Great.

29
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.580
Great.

30
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.710
Great.

31
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.960
Now, the next thing they're going to do is they're going to pass the required fields.

32
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.540
That is our fields that I'm going to go to.

33
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.050
You have to know the first field they need is the full name.

34
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.940
We need the username.

35
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.140
We need the email.

36
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.490
We need to do a password as well.

37
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.970
Okay, now we're going to pass it to the function.

38
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.720
Okay.

39
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.170
The first field you need is the full name, right?

40
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.810
Just a full disclosure name.

41
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.970
Now, this is a test, right?

42
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.740
So it's going to be a data type of.

43
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.180
Strange became designated contrary to the disorder.

44
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.250
Okay, now the other field.

45
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.900
Just the practice.

46
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.290
Okay.

47
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.880
Now, the other field manager, there's the username, email and password.

48
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.420
Okay.

49
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.850
So it is going to be using them as well.

50
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.110
Okay.

51
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.960
Is this going to be a type of test?

52
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.840
This is going to be a different type of string as well.

53
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.190
Right.

54
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.670
Okay.

55
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.610
The next field in it is the.

56
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.940
Email, which is also a test of data type or strength.

57
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.640
We also need that password, which is as well it says.

58
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.700
So it's going to be a type of string.

59
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.200
Okay.

60
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.990
Now as well, we are going to be needed to image.

61
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.380
Right.

62
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.950
But it will do that later.

63
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.010
I want you to understand all the process so we can easily pass in the image as well.

64
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.940
Okay.

65
00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.840
Was I going to do that?

66
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.620
It's okay.

67
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.040
Okay.

68
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.350
Now the nesting is over here as it is.

69
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.080
I think you're going to see this shortly.

70
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.770
That is why we decided this.

71
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.270
Okay, great.

72
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:23.440
Now, what I'm going to do next is we are going to check on some validation or do some validation check

73
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.350
or this feels we just have that is we have about 40.

74
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.940
That's right.

75
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.290
So what's it going to do?

76
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.960
This is revenue gave so validation check.

77
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.530
Okay.

78
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.330
So to do this what we can say we can use it try and catch now to have access to the cards easily, you

79
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.020
can just go down to this part of okay, now you can see we have to try out the cash at once.

80
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.360
Okay.

81
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.270
First of all, what we can do is.

82
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.960
Whether you are going to create a report that is going to start to constitute heroes so we can create

83
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.190
a vehicle called race and you can say is equal to some.

84
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.140
Some error occurred.

85
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.680
Okay.

86
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.610
Now, this is a type of test because it is a test, right?

87
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.490
So there's going to be a type of string.

88
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.840
Okay, great.

89
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.290
You're going to break this down, then a little bit is down.

90
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.709
Okay.

91
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.540
Now, the next thing I want to do is do some validation check.

92
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.540
So to do this, we tend to try what you can do.

93
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.600
We can use and use statements.

94
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.080
Then we can see if full or this call name.

95
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.880
Dot is not empty.

96
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.230
And.

97
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.020
The username Dutch is not.

98
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.750
But it's not empty.

99
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.200
Okay.

100
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.970
And.

101
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.830
The email Dutch is not empty.

102
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.440
Right.

103
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.460
Okay.

104
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.160
Then lastly, we're going to say, aren't there passwords?

105
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.600
So it is not every.

106
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.230
That is.

107
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.010
That is not.

108
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.560
And.

109
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.670
See.

110
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.480
Okay, I think.

111
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.500
Okay, class.

112
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.400
What?

113
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.320
Okay, great.

114
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.070
Now, if all the skills are not empty.

115
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.060
Then.

116
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.410
Right.

117
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:58.390
Then what you're going to do is if all those fields are not empty that want to create a user and or

118
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.860
another go to create that user in the authentication tab.

119
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.940
Okay.

120
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.840
You can see that was the reason we have to store the these hearts.

121
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.910
Now we can easily just see if all those fields are not empty.

122
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.950
Then we're going to see Firebase.

123
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.660
Firebase.

124
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.860
I have these.

125
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.840
So he's going to be coming to the family's heart.

126
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.070
Then thought is just that dirt.

127
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.750
Creates user rich email passwords.

128
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.420
You can see it automatically past those two fields.

129
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.890
Okay.

130
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.060
Let's go on to this amazing wall between.

131
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.320
Now, what you're going to do is we're going to create a vehicle to store your hobbies auto distance,

132
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.100
because you're going to be using that until they decide, okay, they're going to go.

133
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.380
So I can start by.

134
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.920
Now what you can do.

135
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.680
We can just give you comments of a look and see if there's.

136
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.680
Via.

137
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.110
Please.

138
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.870
Okay.

139
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.600
Now, what you can do is you can create a video called Firebase or it is going to store the Firebase.

140
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.480
Levees Art.

141
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.870
The East is not the instance of all four.

142
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.640
So what is the other?

143
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.310
So we did it.

144
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.700
Okay.

145
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.900
Now.

146
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:42.010
What you're going to do is if all the fields are not empty, right, then you're going to see if Firebase

147
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.880
does.

148
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.090
So maybe first of all, it's a light.

149
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.020
It's the youth.

150
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.460
Coltrane daughter that's important.

151
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.730
That's so recorded by our base.

152
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.000
All right.

153
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.100
Okay, great.

154
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.910
If for any reason you do this imported, you can click on it.

155
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:02.580
Let's.

156
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.470
It's incredible to watch.

157
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.470
Imported it.

158
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.390
Okay.

159
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.400
So we're going to say does PBS user with email our password.

160
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:10.650
Okay.

161
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.510
Now you can see it automatically pass the email password.

162
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:22.520
Now this ought to create user is going to have this or this so called email add password.

163
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.940
Okay.

164
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.020
But now you can see we also want to know more about the user.

165
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.910
So we also have the feed called the full name and.

166
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.770
Human Rights Watch.

167
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.710
Like I said, the families are also part email or password, but in the future they also going to learn

168
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:46.590
on how to store the full name, the email as well, and also the image.

169
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.820
Okay, great.

170
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.580
So by doing just this, we have automatically created a function to create the user.

171
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.510
Okay.

172
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.650
Now once the kid, as we all do, is we can store this in.

173
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.800
A variable that can still do results in the variable.

174
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.060
We can study results in a way because it's going to be equal to this.

175
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.570
Now, this is going to be a type of user.

176
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.820
Is a curry dish.

177
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.250
It is a type of user credential.

178
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.890
Now, the next thing is you are with the file webinar, which for the files is odd.

179
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.380
And that was the reason we passed is because the other way to use the are which you need to pass is

180
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.110
sync over the function.

181
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:30.890
Okay.

182
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.830
So what you can see is wait.

183
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.680
Okay.

184
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:36.850
Great.

185
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.700
Now the case is going to make this wider.

186
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:44.690
Okay.

187
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.600
Now what's we can do?

188
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.360
Now, remember, this is a variable this way for.

189
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:59.960
This is a very important story in the results of the firebase or it creates user with the email possible

190
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.950
so it automatically has the details of that user.

191
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.620
So what you can do is screens

192
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.240
3.33.1.

193
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.000
Okay.

194
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.240
User your email.

195
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.620
Okay, great.

196
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.000
Now we are going to pass this as provided.

197
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.560
This is Michel to say something like that as well.

198
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:33.590
Was able to do this is all that is variable right.

199
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.910
So what we can do we can say is is equal to sources.

200
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.630
That is only is because you are can see this result authority.

201
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.030
Then we want to create the user with the email and password.

202
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.360
Right.

203
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:57.380
And also we want to change the user username to the broadcaster and also sources.

204
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.640
Okay.

205
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.290
Great.

206
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.150
Not for the cash or ticket.

207
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:10.240
There is rest because of the proviso, because it is required to eat.

208
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.130
That is based on a small error.

209
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.540
It's too strict.

210
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.450
Okay.

211
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.770
We can we on.

212
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.550
Richard Grace.

213
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.220
Okay, great, great.

214
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.330
Now you can see all those streets.

215
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:39.520
So what you can do as well, since we are using clouds, is because it is as is usual some of the time.

216
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.290
You don't need you to go nice.

217
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.430
Okay.

218
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.280
So you can see it is it doesn't string this.

219
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.420
Okay, great.

220
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:55.210
Now, what that is to saying is, if this is not data to go all to create the user with the password

221
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.340
that will take the user that user name to the default also and as well.

222
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.530
So this is based on the message you see, so says, okay, now what is all this?

223
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.460
What is all this abuse?

224
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:16.540
And what we can do is we can see it has a via abs, right.

225
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.600
Because here is this equal to.

226
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:24.990
These.

227
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.760
You can't just have these.

228
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.940
This was not the.

229
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.120
Instead to pay.

230
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.520
Great.

231
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.530
Okay then we don't do this now.

232
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.490
It is absolutely fine.

233
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.310
Grandmother It is a couple of times again.

234
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.150
Right.

235
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.910
Okay, now please continue.

236
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.420
It is simply fine.

237
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:56.940
Okay, now look, it is about a year in advance that you're looking for all these functions up here.

238
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:57.720
Right.

239
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.800
Okay, everybody.

240
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:05.340
Now, what you said was the period you focused on in the past and feel that we also created a greater

241
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.840
regard to store the possible hero which says of error occurred.

242
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:16.290
Otherwise it says since it ties on straight that okay, we have to try to block it.

243
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.520
We'll just simply say to try to block is if all the skills are not.

244
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:27.230
Incidentally, you want to create the user that as well we store that created user in array because

245
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:34.890
read this is a type of user created issue that as well we are trying to the user to do the block also

246
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.150
as well.

247
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.750
Also, we are we don't need the social services.

248
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.210
Okay.

249
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.840
We said how about this?

250
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.860
If this feels empty that if the user did not do in the fields and also he told the message which is

251
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.970
these fields was not the empty else.

252
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.600
That's what the sorry to go to is what it costs.

253
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.740
You said if orders are not made.

254
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:08.010
So probably there are some other heroes apart from all this, then we want to to the hero, right?

255
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.470
So that's what we basically say.

256
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:17.550
So in in this lecture, they're going to call this, which are part side of these to see the results

257
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.570
like, okay, okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
