00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.930
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.370
In this lecture, we are going to talk about navigating with name routes, which is another way of navigating

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.110
within our hub.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.360
And also, I'm going to show you another way of getting rid of this back arrow.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.890
Okay.

7
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.340
Now, not to do this, we have to head back to our voice record and first of all, the customer on screen.

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.480
And we are going to create a name route over here.

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:40.400
We are going to create a variable called Root's name and we can just go ahead and specify the type of

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.290
value it's going to store.

11
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.780
It's going to be a string.

12
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.620
So it's going to be cost.

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.100
And in order to make this variable globally accessible, we are going to make it static.

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.330
Static.

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.990
Okay.

16
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.140
And now we can then say it's equal to the name of the screen.

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.890
Of course, the more we can just use capital later for this customer on screen.

18
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.520
Okay.

19
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.080
Great.

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.850
And the next step is to define.

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.040
Or to tell.

22
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.840
Flow to the rest of our screen that we just created a name route.

23
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.070
To do this, we have to go to the main dot before then use control and save.

24
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.120
And then the main 2.5.

25
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.410
And over here, we can get rid of this.

26
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.910
Okay.

27
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.740
And it has a property known as Roots.

28
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.400
Okay.

29
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.610
And now we can hear the customer.

30
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.270
Home screen.

31
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.220
Homescreen though throughout name and hard this this is going to take context and it sees a function.

32
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.930
And now we basically want to go to the be at the customer home screen.

33
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.470
Okay.

34
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.990
This is basically how to create labor out.

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.600
And what we can also do, we can do this for the London customer screen.

36
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.640
London customer screen, where are you?

37
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.570
And we have it over here.

38
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.240
You can use control and B and.

39
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.200
Over here.

40
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.000
Sorry at the top static to make it globally accessible and cost.

41
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.960
It is a type of string equal to.

42
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.060
Sorry.

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.830
We also have to call this root name.

44
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.790
But it's going to be equal to another value.

45
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.670
Root.

46
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.250
Name a cause to.

47
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.190
London.

48
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.530
You can just use a capital letter.

49
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.360
London costumer.

50
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.280
Then screen.

51
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.260
And had a semicolon and we have to tell flatter or we have to make it globally accessible by adding

52
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.400
it to this and London.

53
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.000
Customer screen the drought name.

54
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.610
And contests.

55
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.930
Okay.

56
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.860
And.

57
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.140
Our function and London customer.

58
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.980
Screen.

59
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.270
Okay.

60
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.710
Nice enough.

61
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.910
This form.

62
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.280
It has a property known as initial roots.

63
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.980
That is the first screen we are going to see and it's going to be the London customer screen, the route

64
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.340
name.

65
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.820
Okay.

66
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.010
And we have to do this as well for the customer home screen.

67
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.700
We just have to do this for all our major screens like via I think we already have it.

68
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.900
String name.

69
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.990
I think I did it for this already.

70
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.490
Okay.

71
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.230
And now in order to get rid of that back arrow, we are going to use another way to navigate to the

72
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.880
customer home screen.

73
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.530
Now over the customer login screen, we can just get rid of this return or via.

74
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.380
And we do not really need that return.

75
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.630
We can just go ahead and say Navigator.

76
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.920
Navigator.

77
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.010
Words.

78
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.430
Of contest and Dodd's push.

79
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.000
This is going to be push name and.

80
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.510
Push them and.

81
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.620
Remove.

82
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.340
On seal.

83
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.890
Okay.

84
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.900
Push them on.

85
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.760
Remember, this is a name route.

86
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.860
You can see it via.

87
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.320
It is in or out.

88
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.440
Right.

89
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.020
So that's why we are saying push name.

90
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.420
So it push and remove all two.

91
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.700
So push name.

92
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.190
Then push name and remove until.

93
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.350
And for the roots.

94
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.990
There's going to be the customer.

95
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.300
Okay.

96
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.660
This hopefully I spelled this correctly.

97
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.620
I'm just going to redo this to make sure it is correctly spelled.

98
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.250
Third push.

99
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.290
Push name and move on.

100
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.760
Okay, great.

101
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.290
Now, this is basically it.

102
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.390
And you can see we have this false value.

103
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.850
Where basically sets in the previous route.

104
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.530
That is the previous page.

105
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.020
That is the page we are coming from.

106
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.030
We are setting it to force.

107
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.110
Right.

108
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.710
So it's going to get rid of that previous page.

109
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.790
And we do not really need that.

110
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.850
However anymore.

111
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.630
Okay, what we can just do, we can we start this?

112
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.670
So you would no longer need this.

113
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.140
Over the homescreen this.

114
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.470
Automatically imply leading.

115
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.070
Okay.

116
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.050
And now we can log in.

117
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.700
I have an account associated with Mark Poor.

118
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.410
I demanded calm and the password is this.

119
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.210
And log in.

120
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.250
Okay.

121
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.070
There is an error.

122
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.500
RAZ okay.

123
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.350
Hopefully.

124
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.860
Maybe we have to return.

125
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.610
He's going to try.

126
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.210
Okay.

127
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.980
Return.

128
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.280
And all we can do is head to this.

129
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.310
Over here and we can turn off this.

130
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.360
And we start.

131
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.260
All three starting.

132
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.480
Okay.

133
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.680
Hopefully it's going to start and we can then try this out.

134
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.720
It's going to start this.

135
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.170
Okay.

136
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.250
And log in.

137
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.380
And Mark.

138
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.730
Poor Jimmy did calm.

139
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.910
So I G.M. dot com.

140
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.730
T.M. It's calm and the password is MSI.

141
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.140
Click on login.

142
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.460
And.

143
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.550
Hopefully we got no errors at this time.

144
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.510
Okay.

145
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.310
And let's go check the profile.

146
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.840
Okay.

147
00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.980
We do not really.

148
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.360
Okay.

149
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.120
We can just get rid of that and see.

150
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:09.500
I think we already have that automatically, which is going to get rid of that error and use control

151
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.510
and save.

152
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.150
Then go check if it's going to be visible.

153
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.190
You can see it is no longer visible because it's going to pop out that previous route.

154
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.520
And let's check for the cards.

155
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:31.330
The you can see it is no longer visible because it's going to pop out the previous page we were coming

156
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:31.840
from.

157
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:39.370
And what we can do, we can try this for the home screen and we can get rid of this.

158
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.860
And see.

159
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.300
And Homescreen.

160
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.360
Okay.

161
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.660
You can see we do not really need that anymore.

162
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.430
So what this would basically do is it would take us to a new route and it's going to pop the previous

163
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.790
route.

164
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.080
We we're coming from by using the navigation navigator navigation.

165
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:06.070
That push is it goes, yes, it's going to take you to a new route, but you still have the chance of

166
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.000
going back.

167
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.750
So what we use was navigator navigation.

168
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.490
Navigates her that off contest dot push name.

169
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.440
Remember, we are dealing with name roots.

170
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:25.910
Name and remove until the customers can and basically want to set the previous roots to force.

171
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:33.890
And this is basically it's I think I talked too much but it is so you understand how everything works.

172
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.810
Okay.

173
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.920
Sounds good, right?

174
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.200
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.

175
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:49.150
But before then, you can just create the name route for the rest of the screen and you have to hide

176
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.540
it over.

177
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:50.820
Okay.

178
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.600
Finally seeing the next lecture.
