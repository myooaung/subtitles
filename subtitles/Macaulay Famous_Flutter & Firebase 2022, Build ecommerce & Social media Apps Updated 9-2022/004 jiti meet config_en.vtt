00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.940
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.130
Walker, in this lecture, we're going to configure the estimates package.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.520
Okay.

4
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.390
Now, to do this, we're gonna need to scroll down to the one section.

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.230
Okay?

6
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.160
Over here, like you can see, the first thing is asking us to do is to set dependency of beauteous

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.440
gradients, a minimum of 3.6.2.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.990
Okay.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.110
So now we're going to need to copy this line.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.140
And yes contingency add up to the code and then the viewed the griddle to fly.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.310
Dude.

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.970
Okay.

13
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.750
We have this in no collapses.

14
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.830
Okay.

15
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.010
Okay.

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.130
Okay.

17
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.650
Okay.

18
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.100
Okay.

19
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.580
Sorry.

20
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.980
Not in this fight.

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.320
I think they have a level view that.

22
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.560
Greater level viewed.

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.320
That's greater.

24
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.800
This is.

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.130
It's.

26
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.110
Okay.

27
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.640
Okay.

28
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590
Or we can just do collabs this as well.

29
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.760
And this is the upper level beat at the credo.

30
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.040
Okay.

31
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.310
So I think we are going to have level and not here.

32
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.680
It should be the project level greater.

33
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.910
Okay.

34
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.280
Now we're gonna need to change this.

35
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.350
Now, get rid of this.

36
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.760
And then.

37
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.280
Is this?

38
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
We then need to indent it and use country in this.

39
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.590
Okay.

40
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.780
Now let's check for the next step.

41
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.320
Okay.

42
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.610
Now we just need to.

43
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.600
We're just going to skip this line of wire where you can do it, make sure yours is the defaults.

44
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.440
That is a 67.

45
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.840
Okay.

46
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.880
Okay.

47
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.400
Now we also need to have this you can see just submit the and read manifest that SML will conflict with

48
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:55.210
your project, namely the application letter field to counter that go to and read have source main then

49
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.600
hundred but manage unread manifest that small.

50
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.200
Okay now said we should go to read.

51
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.230
And red sauce.

52
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.920
Main.

53
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.870
Maine.

54
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.229
Maine.

55
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.560
Maine.

56
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.230
Okay.

57
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.060
Andre.

58
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.120
Trust me.

59
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.460
Okay, so where's this going to be?

60
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.990
This should be.

61
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.270
It's just right after the race.

62
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.650
Okay.

63
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.520
Okay.

64
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.860
Okay.

65
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.940
Under it I can still see main under.

66
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.220
Okay.

67
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.930
That should be it.

68
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.780
Okay.

69
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.080
Now you can see it also looks like.

70
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.700
Okay, so we need to copy this.

71
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.730
I had this slide, had this.

72
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.500
Okay, control and see.

73
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.160
And we're going to need to get rid of this retard down and then paste it.

74
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.120
You can see we have this than over as well.

75
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.310
And now we can use control and that's the save.

76
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.510
Okay.

77
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.170
Now, the other line it wants us to copy.

78
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.590
You can see, choose, replace.

79
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.300
So we need to copy this.

80
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.600
Copy this.

81
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.300
Okay.

82
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.740
And then.

83
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.410
We're going to need two pairs this year and we can format okay this country and that's to save and then

84
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.660
this is all we need over here.

85
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.890
Okay.

86
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.910
Sorry.

87
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.550
Okay.

88
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.860
Now you can see of danger minimum as the key question 222 in your Android hub level right then to view

89
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.440
that gradle.

90
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.020
So you're going to need to go to the hundred.

91
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.700
Hundred have.

92
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.700
Okay.

93
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.810
Hundred is going to collapse this then the bearded widow.

94
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.920
Okay.

95
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.400
Now, instead of Syria, what we can do is get involved.

96
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.530
8224 because when I was a bit jittery, I got some errors.

97
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.310
So make sure you changes to 34 are not 22.

98
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.510
And as well Target said sorry target as the on to 28.

99
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.470
Well we are going to change has to 29.

100
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.710
29.

101
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.730
Okay.

102
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.000
Yes.

103
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.390
Control.

104
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.110
NASA save.

105
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.630
And even then it's as crude now.

106
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.670
And you can see ads, billboards.

107
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.830
He relies for progress.

108
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.680
You can see what it does over here.

109
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.360
Jesse.

110
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.570
Jesse as the and it was pro god.

111
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.580
What's a pro god was?

112
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.940
So we had a pro guide rules that provide that profile rights.

113
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.680
Your release epic build would be missing, right?

114
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.940
So don't want it to be missing.

115
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.090
So what we can do is we're going to need this to be lines.

116
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.380
Okay.

117
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.720
Well, what I can just do is I can copy this as well.

118
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.460
And this I'm going to get rid of this, too.

119
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.680
And we're going to need to go to the beauty types because this is where we have it in Hawaii.

120
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.240
We need to pass it.

121
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.090
And now I can get rid of this too and we can as well.

122
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.710
Indents is okay.

123
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.670
Durham wouldn't have to close up for this lecture, so you see everything clearly.

124
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.150
Okay.

125
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.930
Yes.

126
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.860
Control necessary.

127
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.940
And see what?

128
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.140
Oh, she it Ms..

129
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.010
Okay.

130
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.330
Okay.

131
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.690
We've just done this, right.

132
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.070
Okay.

133
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.980
Now, then had fire in the same territory.

134
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.870
Code pro god.

135
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.190
Was that so far?

136
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.790
Now, if we just click on this, then I'm going to see anything.

137
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.110
And that is why this just cements package is not that organized.

138
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.950
When Amy organizes, there is no good documentation for this.

139
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.690
Okay.

140
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.700
You can see Page not found, but already I have the rules.

141
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.670
I will go to my give.

142
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.950
First of all is asking us to create if I could pro God.

143
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.130
Per guide rules that proviso.

144
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.810
What I can do is I can copy.

145
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.620
This, I don't think in a spelling mistake.

146
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.130
Okay.

147
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.010
Now within the have is asking us to create it within rehab.

148
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.390
So new file.

149
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.620
Now I'm just going to paint this.

150
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.240
Okay, I think.

151
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.720
Okay.

152
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.300
Leading or trending by space detected.

153
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.130
Okay, great.

154
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.760
And now I can copy this story.

155
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.210
This is going to be available to you.

156
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.560
You're going to see data, right?

157
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.900
And the results of this lecture.

158
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.380
Okay.

159
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.860
Sorry.

160
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.470
Then we need to face it like this just through so we don't really need to take orders.

161
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.240
They are just riffs.

162
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.660
Okay.

163
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.970
We can then use control and save.

164
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.490
Okay.

165
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.130
Okay.

166
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.580
Okay.

167
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.960
Okay.

168
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.470
I think this is basically it's hopefully we are not missing anything.

169
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:36.020
The first thing we did was to go to our unread rights and we change this before we have in four point

170
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.350
something.

171
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.650
Right.

172
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.470
And we changed it to 2.6.2.

173
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.860
Right.

174
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.500
And we did this in the project level.

175
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.910
And we are not ditching anything yet.

176
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.370
But you can just make sure you are using the 67.

177
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.500
You can find dots in the in the corridor and.

178
00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:01.950
I think you basically find out in this then good the rapper because the music they do for it which is

179
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.800
season seven so as well make sure you're using this default as you might get an error and as well make

180
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.170
sure you are using this API 29.

181
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.810
I think it does not support techy.

182
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.700
That is the guesstimates package.

183
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.930
Okay.

184
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.720
Probably might get some errors like the the probably what sort of like widescreen or something like

185
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.960
that.

186
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.530
I don't really know.

187
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.410
But just make sure you use in 29 or probably if it supports, it's okay.

188
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.590
Okay.

189
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.980
I think this is basically it.

190
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.210
Okay.

191
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.140
Now, what you're going to need to do is to restart your.

192
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.410
Yes, you could you can just cut it and then restarts and make sure it gets everything.

193
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.810
Most importantly, this package, we just had it.

194
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.370
Right.

195
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.320
So make sure you get everything right.

196
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.020
Make sure it recognizes it's okay.

197
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.580
So that does what you're gonna need to do to stop this and restarts.

198
00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.630
It's okay.

199
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.340
Okay, guys.

200
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.100
