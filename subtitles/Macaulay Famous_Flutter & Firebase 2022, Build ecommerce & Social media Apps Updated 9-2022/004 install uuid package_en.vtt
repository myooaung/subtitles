00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.010
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.080
Then you need to generate a unique number.

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.360
Varieties of ways to do this.

5
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.140
Yes, there varieties of ways to do this is influence.

6
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.900
You can achieve the same results by using varieties of ways.

7
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.380
Okay.

8
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.310
Now, like I said, in order to generate a unique number, you can use varieties of ways to do this.

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.250
And I think in the Zoom call section I've shown, you also generate a unique number using a round on

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.180
method.

11
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.640
Okay.

12
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.940
So now in this section, I'm going to show you on how to do this with the package.

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.410
Okay.

14
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
So now I head up to your browser and add up to your pub, the dev.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.280
Then you're going to search for something known as you.

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.700
You.

17
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.420
I'd.

18
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.680
So this is going to give us some unique numbers.

19
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.490
Again, like I said, you can basically use a them for this.

20
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.850
Okay.

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.940
So what you're going to need to do is we're going to copy this code and then.

22
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.320
You're going to go to.

23
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.170
They passed big GMO.

24
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.070
They don't need to do exactly what I'm doing.

25
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.690
You can just use the random method in order to generate a unique I.D. number, and that's it.

26
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.840
Think I'm showing you that in the zip code section.

27
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.540
So anyone you think is more understandable to you.

28
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.650
But I think using the package is more understandable.

29
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.150
You can just use two line of codes and you are done.

30
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.610
Okay.

31
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.430
You're going to see the signal to the power of.

32
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.150
Package.

33
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.740
You're going to see the power of this shortly.

34
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.170
Okay.

35
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.070
I think you're going to see it in the next lecture.

36
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.580
So.

37
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.620
Okay.

38
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.410
I don't even need to wait for this decision.

39
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.930
Okay.

40
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.730
I think it's dawn.

41
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.610
You can just make sure it's done by.

42
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.650
By clicking on it again and.

43
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.100
Probably you're going to need to restart your visa code in order to really take note of that package

44
00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.910
you just added.

45
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.470
So you can see that it does.

46
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.570
I'm going to do this in this separate lecture.

47
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.330
I'm just going to make this a separate lecture.

48
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.190
Okay, this is done already.

49
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.570
We can just do this again.

50
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.940
And that's and make sure it's is.

51
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.680
Well, he died.

52
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.930
Okay.

53
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.520
It's going to take some time.

54
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.990
Okay.

55
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.410
It's done.

56
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.790
Okay.

57
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.150
So what you're going to need to do is probably you can close your vehicle and.

58
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.600
And then we started.
