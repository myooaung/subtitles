00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.040
Now as well, users are going to be able to upload an image.

4
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.020
So now what we can do is we can have a default image over here.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.640
Then on top of that default image, that will have a camera icon.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.690
So that icon is clicked is going to give a pop up to the user.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.350
So users are going to be able to choose to upload the image from the gallery or camera.

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.610
Okay, so they're going to do this.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.620
Now, like I said, we're going to do this at the top.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.100
That's over here.

11
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.620
So what you can do is you can make that widget, this first widget.

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.370
So it's going to be above the first test field.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.030
Okay.

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.570
Good.

15
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.350
So now, like I said, that create a default image over here.

16
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.570
Then on top of that, the fourth image, you're going to have a camera icon.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.290
Okay.

18
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.020
Now in that up this widget on top widget above using a widget known as stock.

19
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.830
Okay.

20
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.460
So all their revenue use is packed with that.

21
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.550
Now the reason for that is basically they want to place another widget on top of that ticket.

22
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.430
Okay.

23
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.610
This is going to take multiple widgets.

24
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.060
It adds the teacher most of all, and this is going to do it really close.

25
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.130
Okay.

26
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.490
Now, the first widget we're going to need is a circle circle avatar.

27
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.650
Now they're going to give a radius of 64.

28
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.600
That's around.

29
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.240
We want it to be okay.

30
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.900
Now, it will have the background color for us.

31
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.690
That's as if the image can't load.

32
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.510
We just want a color of colors that you.

33
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.550
Okay.

34
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.600
Now as well.

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.230
We're going to have a background image which for now for the purpose of automotive show you this was

36
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.780
a let's work image then I'm just gonna say profile pics.

37
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.640
Okay.

38
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.810
Now if we should save this, everything gets an hero and the hero is going to get thrown at the vehicle

39
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.440
and it's going to crash our heart.

40
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.039
Okay.

41
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.070
Now, to get rid of this, you can see over here it is spits instead of B and so on.

42
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.700
But we are just giving it says that is for five weeks so that we get on here.

43
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.360
If we should save this right now, this error is going to get thrown at our vehicle which will eventually

44
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.190
crash our have now enough to get rid of that.

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.660
What we can do is first of all, I can't really see the debug icon over.

46
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.070
So what I can do is use control and minus two now to reduce the size of the support.

47
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.770
Then I'm going to go to just debug although I can now you can see we have this breakpoint nice for any

48
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.880
reason you can see this.

49
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.700
What you're going to see for us is all stock.

50
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.660
They're going to click on that stock and click on this breakpoints.

51
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.050
Okay.

52
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.200
Now you can see we have this breakpoints of I now you can see this is all caught by.

53
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.640
Right.

54
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.840
So what I want to do before is just check whatever is on.

55
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.370
Check it.

56
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.970
So make sure you check this.

57
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.290
Okay.

58
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.580
Okay.

59
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.720
So now you're sick of the.

60
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.490
Get in here.

61
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.930
What's the error?

62
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.440
Is a little get thrown at you.

63
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.210
Yes, you could, but it's going to get thrown at your TiVo console so your app is able to crash.

64
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.600
Okay.

65
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.450
So now I lose control and lost again, not to make this sport more bigger.

66
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.380
Okay.

67
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.070
Okay.

68
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.550
Now going to switch on B, okay.

69
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.950
This is too big.

70
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.340
Okay.

71
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.360
Let's see if this is okay.

72
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.750
Right.

73
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.630
Okay, so that's now we can use control and this to save this now.

74
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.670
Okay.

75
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.870
Okay, go check it out.

76
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.560
It is a device that you go to check out the book or so.

77
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.580
The bulk of.

78
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.230
So you're going to see this area.

79
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.610
It's not because of that.

80
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.510
Because I've checked.

81
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.570
You're going to get thrown at the vehicle, which will eventually go to crash our great.

82
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.630
Okay.

83
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.040
Now this is the first widget.

84
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.370
Then you're the widget.

85
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.730
We're going to have a special place on top of this image.

86
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.060
Right.

87
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.500
So what I will do is symbol had a critical mark.

88
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.030
Now this stock has a property as well known as position.

89
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.190
Okay.

90
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.060
Position.

91
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.970
Okay.

92
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.390
I'm going to have a container.

93
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.340
Or we can just get rid of the container.

94
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.270
We don't really need it.

95
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.980
It is going to say, I can't.

96
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.490
Okay.

97
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.230
In this movie, I call that.

98
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.310
On this score

99
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.000
for two.

100
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.640
Okay.

101
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.480
They put it back.

102
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.620
Let's see if we need another additional color.

103
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.820
Okay.

104
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.570
We'll check it out.

105
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.020
Okay.

106
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.240
So you can see the value.

107
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.800
Now, what we can do is we can take these to this side.

108
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.060
Okay.

109
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.410
So in this position, we can give a total of 80.

110
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.680
Okay.

111
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.700
Now let's check it out.

112
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.920
What's it does?

113
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.770
Okay.

114
00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.790
Oh, you?

115
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.740
Yes.

116
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.340
I left my notes and.

117
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.500
This is no war.

118
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.220
Why?

119
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.170
But the.

120
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.290
So you're going to take it to the right.

121
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.670
Right.

122
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.890
So what you can see is.

123
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.590
Right.

124
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.900
Zero.

125
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.740
But this is going to go to the.

126
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.540
Right.

127
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.890
Okay.

128
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.330
Now for the bottom end of the semanas.

129
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.860
It's a first to see what, guys.

130
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.020
Okay.

131
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.680
You can see this again.

132
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.820
Okay.

133
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.770
It's the.

134
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.540
So most of the time they say you just have to try it out.

135
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.570
I'd say, but it should be.

136
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.550
Okay.

137
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.580
Just give a chance for us to see what it does as well.

138
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.810
Okay, great.

139
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.050
I think this is what we want off of the record.

140
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.000
Yes.

141
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.940
If I could take it would be like this.

142
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.940
Okay.

143
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.740
Good.

144
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.830
Now, what you're going to do is get a space between this and this.

145
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.430
Right.

146
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.510
So as well, you know, now a going to use is six books.

147
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.850
Right.

148
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.140
Then they're going to give this space vertically.

149
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.910
So there's going to be heights of 20 as well.

150
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.210
Okay.

151
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.960
Okay.

152
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.790
When you click on any of this.

153
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:11.920
Okay.

154
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.240
There you can see we got this error and I have to get rid of this error.

155
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:22.180
What we can do is the is it is finding it difficult to scroll.

156
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.540
So what we can do is we can grab this with this scroll.

157
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.960
With that, you have to make this page scrollable.

158
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.130
Got to do this.

159
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:38.710
What we just have to do is over this column, but it's got to add dots and that cannot be permitted.

160
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.210
We get it.

161
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.160
We get this known as single slide, single child scroll view.

162
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.560
So by doing this will make the side of the page scrollable.

163
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.400
Okay.

164
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.480
So finance to save.

165
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:57.770
Okay.

166
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.620
Like I said, is gone, but we get pushed off at the top.

167
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.710
So now what we can do is over this continent.

168
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:12.780
Now you can see the alignment and alignment alignment center.

169
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.370
Okay.

170
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.920
And it's going to take it to the center.

171
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:17.790
Okay.

172
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:21.850
Okay.

173
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.180
Great.

174
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.590
Now you can see.

175
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.840
The page is now scrollable, and he does have that fixed area in the middle.

176
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.370
Okay, great.

177
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.980
Okay.

178
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.330
Okay.

179
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.060
Okay, guys, see you next lecture.
