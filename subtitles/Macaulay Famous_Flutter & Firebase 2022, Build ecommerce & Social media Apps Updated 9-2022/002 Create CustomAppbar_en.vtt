00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.060
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.520
Then this lecture will create a constant high bar that is over.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.690
You can have it switched over.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.910
Then you're going to have an icon, which I wish is just going to be similar to this.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.140
Okay.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.380
Not to do this.

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm going to go back to Our Vinci Code.

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.840
They are going to be doing this and the whole screen.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.240
Right.

10
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.420
So I'm going to go to the home screen.

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.190
Okay.

12
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.240
Now in order to have a more cleaner code, what we can do is open this crazy folder.

13
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.220
We can create another for the wish the call widget.

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.300
Okay.

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.340
Then over this widget folder, you can create a new PHI, which we can't call custom.

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.000
But Escobar thought that.

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.510
Okay, now we can go with the settlers, which is.

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.610
Because the zip code is custom up for controlled by allied control and dots.

19
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.710
And that's important that you have that package.

20
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.130
Okay.

21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.860
We can use which on this is save this file then we can go back to our.

22
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.020
Home screen.

23
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.810
Okay.

24
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.130
Now, is it of this set of widgets, we can just get rid of this, then use a column or.

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.430
The reason for this column is because we want all of our widgets to be displayed vertically.

26
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
That is from top to bottom.

27
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.730
Right.

28
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.140
Okay.

29
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.540
Now this color widget can take in multiple widgets so you can see children.

30
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.220
Now we are just going to pass first the cost of.

31
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.700
Okay, great.

32
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.230
Now over the course of our we don't really need to return a scaffold, but a container says we already

33
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.420
have the scaffold over.

34
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.760
Right.

35
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.140
Okay.

36
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.660
I'm trying to be now.

37
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.780
Now we're going to start designing the custom either.

38
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.940
First of all, you can see we have.

39
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.180
We have to, which is that is this test of this test we get over here and this I call widgets and both

40
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.460
are being displayed horizontally.

41
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.230
That is from left to right.

42
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.390
Now, to achieve this, got the reason?

43
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.720
What?

44
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.600
A real widget.

45
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.170
Okay.

46
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.900
So now we're going to say child.

47
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.460
The child is going to be a rule widget.

48
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.550
It can take multiple charges as this should read.

49
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.860
Right.

50
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.270
Okay.

51
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.180
Nicola.

52
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.890
Okay.

53
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.270
Now the first thing you're going to have is a test widget.

54
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.300
Right now, you can see over the finish stuff, we have this ice symbol, right.

55
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.390
And I know that I have this old saying, what's it going to be?

56
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.960
Is it is a widget known as which test?

57
00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.930
Okay.

58
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.590
Now for this test is going to be some standardized test.

59
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.940
Okay.

60
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.260
Also this this plant got sick multiple, which is it as a surgeon.

61
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.730
But we are just going to be needing just to.

62
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.360
That's as you can see over here, we have this test and we also have this high symbol.

63
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.140
Right.

64
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.700
So.

65
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.360
They're going to have to test far right.

66
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.300
Like I said.

67
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.460
Okay.

68
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.550
This is for the test.

69
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.490
Either through the camera, then.

70
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.120
The other tests by.

71
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.430
Which is going to be for the high.

72
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.910
Okay.

73
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.200
I did try to cover.

74
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.930
Okay.

75
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.500
Great.

76
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:56.040
Now for this this one aspect that says this is the type of test we can just say who the thing to test

77
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.210
is, who the.

78
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.160
Homer, right.

79
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.450
Then what's.

80
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.330
You know, you can see over here.

81
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.820
This went down.

82
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.720
So the next line that is they're looking for, they have to take this to the next light.

83
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.360
What they're going to do is release the backslash.

84
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.260
Backslash, and then it's going to be looking.

85
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.030
Looking.

86
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.730
Four.

87
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.870
Okay.

88
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.490
Now use controlling to save.

89
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.590
Okay.

90
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.180
We're just going to have to start this.

91
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.600
And that's a save those on saved files.

92
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.970
Okay.

93
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.690
Okay.

94
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.710
Now, we really can't see this because the effort there is this is going to take the color of white.

95
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.950
And this guy forward is a background of white.

96
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.160
Right.

97
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.970
So you can't really see that.

98
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.380
Okay.

99
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.520
Now what they're going to do, they're going to change the color of the rooster.

100
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.830
So they're just going to say.

101
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.450
STI test sti.

102
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.090
So this is going to be colour of colours.

103
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.410
That's why it's.

104
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.600
Okay.

105
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.360
I think we need one more.

106
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.930
Okay.

107
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.570
So I think we are just this should be colors that black because the fourth is going to take the whites

108
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.020
color.

109
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.270
So for that.

110
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.960
I can I can see you can see this now.

111
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.400
Okay.

112
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.200
Now, what you can do is you can just give me a font size of 35 to this.

113
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.570
And if it's.

114
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.290
Alfonso, it's.

115
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.560
That would.

116
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.550
Okay.

117
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.720
Great.

118
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.440
Now also revenue.

119
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.100
Too for this.

120
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.850
Right.

121
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.200
So now they need to use that eye symbol, head off to have more PDA to talk.

122
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.920
Okay.

123
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.750
Now we can easily search for highway.

124
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.770
Okay.

125
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.140
Okay.

126
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.690
Now you can just click on this, but I think I'm just going to go with something else.

127
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.570
You're going to go with this zany face.

128
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.470
I think I love this.

129
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.610
Okay, then all we have to do is to copy this code.

130
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.960
You can go within the right.

131
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.200
So you can go with this quote, feel this.

132
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.710
You can go with any of your choice or you can just search for something that's way.

133
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.180
Okay.

134
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.500
So now I'm going to go back to ABC Code then as well.

135
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.380
We're going to have to test this is it is a type of test.

136
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.090
So it isn't the test is.

137
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.220
Okay, great.

138
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.450
Now he's got chance to see if and we'll check it out.

139
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.160
Okay now because it's so big.

140
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.730
This big.

141
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.530
So we can give this tie.

142
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.930
Then just stay.

143
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.360
Okay we can just change the font size to 35 said can small bigger.

144
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.560
Okay.

145
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.090
Great.

146
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.840
Now, Dennis, you are going to have to take this to the bottom and also take it from a bit a bit from

147
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.290
the left.

148
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.710
Okay.

149
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.610
Not to do this, you need to wrap it to the container.

150
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.090
But fortunately, we already have the container.

151
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.620
So I just want to go ahead and pass the part in.

152
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.030
So I'm going to give it.

153
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.960
It said it's holy.

154
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.730
Is this going to be positive for the top?

155
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.570
So we want it to go from the top of four.

156
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.840
Sorry, 2 to 5.

157
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.340
It's in 2 to 5 is okay.

158
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.590
Then as well.

159
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.340
I wanted to go from the left from.

160
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.390
That's if I could try to save now and go check it out.

161
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.650
Okay.

162
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.150
I think it is going to go to Etsy.

163
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.710
30.

164
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:22.950
Okay.

165
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.520
Good.

166
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.260
Okay.

167
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.750
I think we need to have this.

168
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.980
Question mark over.

169
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.169
Now you can go with you.

170
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.270
I think already we have the high, right?

171
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.160
So you can just go right to the I.

172
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.340
But I think I lost some.

173
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.300
I need to play a bit, so so I have to go with the than the face.

174
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.870
But you can go with any of your choice.

175
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.770
We have a lot.

176
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.240
We are.

177
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.370
This is mainly our people, reality, the animals and nature, food and drink activity.

178
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.080
Travel is okay, so you can go with those.

179
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.370
But please note this What's the toughest part of the visitor is going to take the colour of whites so

180
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.850
that KZN is on your home?

181
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.600
You should say.

182
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.490
