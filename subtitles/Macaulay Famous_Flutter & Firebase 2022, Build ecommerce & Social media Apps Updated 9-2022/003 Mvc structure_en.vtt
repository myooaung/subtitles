00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.630
Guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.070
Now, what I simply did was to run the hab over here, and this is the default float I created for us.

4
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:08.520
Okay.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.560
Now, what we can do is we're going to create a new screen.

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.980
Okay?

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.990
Now, the parts are going to be isn't is not as we see, which means models, views, controllers.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.410
Okay.

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.640
So over the sleep directory, we are going to create a new folder.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.960
Okay.

11
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.260
Models views controller.

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.860
Right.

13
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.189
Okay.

14
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.300
That is MVC.

15
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.640
So this is going to be modems.

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.820
Okay.

17
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.290
Okay.

18
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:47.620
Now, the modus is we're going to be creating all our fields, such as the username field, the password

19
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.870
field and others.

20
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.260
Okay.

21
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.190
So now where we said models use control, I write a case over here, we're going to create a new folder

22
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.750
and this is going to be views.

23
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.130
Okay.

24
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.930
Now the views is we are going to be creating our screens such as the sign up screen, the login screen,

25
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.430
the media screen, the images screen and so hard.

26
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.880
Okay.

27
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.470
And then new folder and controllers.

28
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.410
Controllers.

29
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.960
Okay, now the controllers are tree or controller for the is where you're going to be creating all our

30
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:36.070
logic such as function to sign off users function to log in user function to create medicine, to join

31
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.320
medicine and so on.

32
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.770
Okay.

33
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.430
Now like I said, the views that tree is where we're going to be creating all our what's our screens

34
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.240
or UI.

35
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.320
Okay, so what we can do over this views directory, we can create a new folder and we can call this

36
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.460
folder screens.

37
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.030
Okay then over the screens.

38
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.400
Further, we can then create a new fly and we can call this logging on the score screen than the section

39
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.360
dot dot.

40
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.800
Okay.

41
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.780
And you can go ahead and use is less widgets just not going to be changing.

42
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.230
Okay.

43
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.170
Staircase less widgets as well.

44
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.280
We can call this logging screen.

45
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.950
Then over a year you're going to need to alight and use control.

46
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.050
And that's okay.

47
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.130
Ack ack ack lights and use control and dots in the same part.

48
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.890
The material, the dots package ack.

49
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.320
Okay.

50
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.800
Great.

51
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.490
Now, instead of this, all we can do is.

52
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.710
Over this class.

53
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.970
We can get rid of everything we have over here since we have now the login screen and.

54
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.110
Instead of this, we can get rid of this.

55
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.830
You can see we have this area because we just deleted that.

56
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.690
Okay.

57
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.230
And it's going to be log in screen.

58
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.860
Okay.

59
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.740
We can get rid of the cast.

60
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.280
Okay.

61
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.170
Now all we can do is.

62
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.010
Over a year.

63
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.460
In order to have access to loss of property, we're going to be using a widget known as scaffold.

64
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.600
Okay.

65
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.450
This is going to give us access to loss of property, which the container is going to give us, such

66
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.630
as the harbour body and so on.

67
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.100
So for now, you can have a body and an obvious sense.

68
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.450
Our widgets is centered in this widget we're going to be using.

69
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.990
Okay, now then this widgets are going to be isn't is going to be a test which as we can see.

70
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.470
Right.

71
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.090
Test.

72
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.490
And this is going to be we can just see the log in screen for now.

73
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.960
Okay.

74
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.660
Now, what we can do is what we start this.

75
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.830
Okay.

76
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.850
They know that also gets rid of this other line.

77
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.640
What we can simply do is we can go to the analysis or just caution and comment this out.

78
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.920
Then use contra and ask to save this fi.

79
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.450
It is country and s and you can hope to start this.

80
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.430
Okay.

81
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.910
Okay.

82
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.420
Okay.

83
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.930
Okay.

84
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.380
Okay.

85
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.860
Okay.

86
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.340
Okay.

87
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.330
Okay, okay.

88
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.380
Okay.

89
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.460
Now let's check it out.

90
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.420
Okay.

91
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.730
You can see now all we can do is we can get rid of this the back burner.

92
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.000
Okay?

93
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.540
To do that, we're going to need to go to the main to that far.

94
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.790
And over here, we can just get rid of this comment as well.

95
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.380
Okay.

96
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.730
Get rid of this comment.

97
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.120
And I within the material up, you can see the board should check by now.

98
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.590
We can set it to force.

99
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.480
Therefore it is going to be true.

100
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.970
And does what you are currently saying that okay.

101
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.770
We can hold to start this and.

102
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.350
Check.

103
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.610
Okay.

104
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.270
You're going to see it's going to go off now.

105
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.820
Okay.

106
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.310
Ack ack ack ack ack ack.

107
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.220
Okay.

Okay.

109
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.780
Great.

110
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.260
Okay.

111
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.110
Okay, guys, you can see we have the test in the center because we are using words.

112
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.550
The center widget, widgets.

113
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.260
You can see this, it's a widget is over this test widget.

114
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.650
Right.

115
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.110
So you took it to watch the center.

116
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.610
Okay.
