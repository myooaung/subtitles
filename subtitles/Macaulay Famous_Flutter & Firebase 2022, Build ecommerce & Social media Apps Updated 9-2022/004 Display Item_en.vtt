00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.770
In this lecture, we are going to display the hardest products.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.020
Or try not to do this.

5
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:17.810
We have to go to the second container, and within the container we can then have a child.

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.980
And in order to display cards item we are going to be using this we should send before it is known as

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.750
consumer.

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.800
Okay.

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.700
And as you know, the consumer has a property known as builder and it's going to take in the contest

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.590
and value.

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.760
And child.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.260
Okay.

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
And over here we have to specify the data.

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.990
We want to assess it is the cards provider data and is it of value?

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.040
What we can then do is we can call this card provider.

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.910
Remember, you can see this card provider as a variable which stores the cards provider class.

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.490
Okay.

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.120
And over here we can then return a list view.

19
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.750
This year.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.560
You can build it.

21
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.970
You can basically just copy those code we have in the car screen list.

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.050
View the builder.

23
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.120
And it's going to take the contest and the intense.

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.280
Great.

25
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.720
And as you know, the lowest bidder bidder has a property known as item counts.

26
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.700
And this is going to be provider.

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.940
Then that counts.

28
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.730
Okay.

29
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.610
And over here we have the return.

30
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.990
And for now we can return maybe a container.

31
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.910
A container widget and we can just give this container maybe a height.

32
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.210
Of Android.

33
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.760
Highlights of Android.

34
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.620
Okay.

35
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.230
And we can give this.

36
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.530
Okay.

37
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.030
Sorry.

38
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.210
I think we know where.

39
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.620
And we can give this a better.

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.420
So the correction and box.

41
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.870
Box decoration.

42
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.550
Okay.

43
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.750
We can give this a border.

44
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.640
Maybe border.

45
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.920
All for all sides.

46
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.930
What are all.

47
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.080
And we can give this maybe weights of maybe zero.

48
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.000
That for that is our stock is going to be okay.

49
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.460
And we can just use concur and say first and how your transformer.

50
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.610
Your trading career and.

51
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.390
Go check this out.

52
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.660
Okay.

53
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.720
Okay.

54
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.010
You can see currently we have just one item added to our cards and that's why we are saying just this,

55
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.730
to make this more visible.

56
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.730
What we can do is maybe we could give this a caller or.

57
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.590
Okay, sorry.

58
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.330
We could say maybe color.

59
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.010
Call us that, Grey.

60
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.970
Or Green.

61
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.000
So you're able to say this and you can give this a better.

62
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.100
Water radios and water radios.

63
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.290
But I reject whatever it is.

64
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.710
Okay.

65
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.000
Whatever ideas.

66
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.450
Okay.

67
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.890
But are we just that secular or maybe 15?

68
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.830
Okay.

69
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.450
Use control and save.

70
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.490
And how you come by.

71
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.240
You know, that's from others.

72
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.670
And we could also had away.

73
00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.730
And where.

74
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.900
Okay.

75
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.300
And go check this out.

76
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.510
Okay.

77
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.270
Look in red.

78
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.050
Get rid of this and hopefully you can say this now or what we can just do.

79
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.529
Okay.

80
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.410
We can hide on that product first, but before then we can wrap this container with a and to give each

81
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.240
container or two to give each card item in space, we can wrap this part in maybe ten.

82
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.530
You can see currently we have one item that.

83
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.620
See our card.

84
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.180
Okay.

85
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.330
Okay.

86
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.720
I think the product should be okay.

87
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.520
And we can add more item to our cart.

88
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.420
Christopher.

89
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.470
Let's just wait for this.

90
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.700
Sorry for the delay.

91
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:06.320
Go back and you can see we have one item and that's why one is displaying based on this card provider

92
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.070
that counts.

93
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.270
Okay.

94
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.340
We could have this.

95
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.270
Of.

96
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.990
We could have this.

97
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.750
We could had.

98
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.200
That's okay.

99
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.440
And Todd.

100
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.600
And check out.

101
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.280
Okay.

102
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.060
Sims could.

103
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.400
Right.

104
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.970
Okay.

105
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.270
And once we can then sweeten the box decoration.

106
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.220
So within the container, we can then have a child and the child is going to be a row.

107
00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.650
A Rover jet and we can look children and the first child is going to be a size box because basically

108
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.850
we want to display.

109
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.940
So you just bring this to the next nine first and size box.

110
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.710
Says Box.

111
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.040
We can give this size box a height of we read.

112
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:25.130
Hundred and maybe weeks of maybe 100 and then chide.

113
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.340
Okay.

114
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.150
There's going to be a major network.

115
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.640
Immediate network, and this is going to be cut per rider.

116
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.180
Care provider and.

117
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.880
DOD so it cut provider did get items and we want to assess each by your index and this is going to be

118
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.480
does.

119
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:59.580
The words images URL and we just want to assess the the first by saying zero.

120
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.260
Okay.

121
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.310
And I think we are missing one.

122
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.040
Okay.

123
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.220
That's just over in this to see what we're missing.

124
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.110
Okay.

125
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.690
Is control necessary?

126
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.030
And we check this out.

127
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.420
Okay.

128
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.690
Okay, Cisco.

129
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.490
SIM cool, right?

130
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.090
Okay.

131
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.760
And now we can look down the road.

132
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.960
We can have.

133
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.850
It has.

134
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.400
Which is going to be cut provider.

135
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.920
Card provider.

136
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.090
Cut provider.

137
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.070
To get items we want to assess each body are index and this is going to be your name.

138
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.250
Okay.

139
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.220
The name and this.

140
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.140
Okay.

141
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.370
And use control and save.

142
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.100
You should see it over here.

143
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.560
Okay.

144
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.380
I think we're just going to stop in this stop this video over here.

145
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.440
Then the next lecture, we are going to continue.
