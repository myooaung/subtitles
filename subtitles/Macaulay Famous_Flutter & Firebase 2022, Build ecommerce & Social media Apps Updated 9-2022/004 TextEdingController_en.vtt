00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.350
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.740
Now, before we start creating the functionality to sign up users, we are going to first talk about

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.210
test entity controller.

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.970
Now what we're going to try to do in this lecture is we're going to grab the input of the user.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.660
Okay.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.020
Now, in order to do this, we are going to need to go back to our voice code and then the view's dietary.

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.100
And then the London customer screen.

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.090
Sorry.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:37.770
So for that landing customer screen and now we can use control and B, to make this wide line enough

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
to grab the user in periods or whatever the user is going to type in here.

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.120
We are going to be using something known as test ADC controller.

13
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.750
Okay.

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.140
So over here.

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.840
We are going to create a finer variable and we are going to call this variable on the score.

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.349
The first field we have over here is the full name so we can say on the score.

17
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.710
Full name controller.

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.550
We are using this on the score so this variable will be assessable outside this file.

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.170
So on this score full name and we are going to say is equal to.

20
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.870
Test.

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.830
A detailed.

22
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.580
It did.

23
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.900
Same controller.

24
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.620
Controller.

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.740
Okay.

26
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.120
This is it.

27
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.960
Okay.

28
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.170
Now as well.

29
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.290
We can specify the type of this variable.

30
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.860
So over here we can say this variable is a type of test that's in controller.

31
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.140
Okay.

32
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.770
Now what we have to do is we have to bind this variable to that full name test field.

33
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.950
Okay.

34
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.090
So we have the full name.

35
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.800
Now it's in the test form.

36
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.450
Field or test field.

37
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.710
The.

38
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.240
This home field has a property known as controller.

39
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.210
And now we can call that variable we just created called Full Name.

40
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.880
Full name controller OC great as well.

41
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.440
You're going to need to do for the image control the image test field and the password test field.

42
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.190
Okay.

43
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.510
So over here.

44
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.520
We can create a finite variable and we can just go ahead and specify the type of variable it is a type

45
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.040
of test controller and we can say underscore email.

46
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.640
Controller is required to test and detain.

47
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.860
That same controller.

48
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.170
Everything.

49
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.770
Controller.

50
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.430
Okay.

51
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.020
And lastly, we can create a final variable test editing controller.

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.870
Right, and underscore.

53
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.640
Password Controller.

54
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.520
Sorry.

55
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.230
Password controller, it's going to be equal to test and detain.

56
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.230
Controller.

57
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.990
Okay.

58
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.220
This is basically it.

59
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.770
And now we have to bind these two variables to those two test fields.

60
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.040
And over here, controller is going to be underscore email.

61
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.550
Controller.

62
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.530
This core image controller.

63
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.420
And.

64
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.020
This is for the password.

65
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.680
Okay.

66
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.040
Over here, we can say controller or the score.

67
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.480
Password.

68
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.120
Controller.

69
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.760
So by doing this, we now have access to whatever the user is going to type in.

70
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.480
So what we can do is over this function where we have the sign up.

71
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.560
This is the content that I remember.

72
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.930
We created the button from scratch.

73
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.280
That is this button.

74
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.110
We created it from scratch.

75
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.630
Right.

76
00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:23.730
So what we can do is we can wrap this container with a button and we have various type of button for

77
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.960
sure.

78
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.840
So what we can basically do is highlight and use control dots.

79
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.530
And we're going to wrap this with a widget.

80
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.750
And this widget is a type of button known as gesture.

81
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.580
Gesture.

82
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.200
Okay.

83
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.180
Gesture detector.

84
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.750
Okay.

85
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.130
Now, the gesture detector has a property known as on tap, which is the function.

86
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.660
Okay.

87
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.980
So now all we want to do is we're going to need to say print.

88
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.070
We want to print the underscore.

89
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.000
By the score full.

90
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.680
Name.

91
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.990
Controller.

92
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.290
Controller.

93
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.310
Controller.

94
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.280
I hope this sort of played it for me.

95
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.590
Okay, let's go for.

96
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.870
Name controller.

97
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.360
Then Dot says that is the value.

98
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.670
Okay as well.

99
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.650
We can say Prince.

100
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.670
GREENE So this is going to be underscore email.

101
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.340
Controller.

102
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.410
Then the test that is the value of whatsoever the user is going to type in.

103
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.640
And lastly.

104
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.310
So this should be this.

105
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.880
Okay.

106
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.950
And lastly, we can see prints on the score.

107
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.850
Password.

108
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.200
Controller don't test.

109
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.060
Okay.

110
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.230
Now we can open our seminar.

111
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.310
New seminar?

112
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.490
And see.

113
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.590
Okay.

114
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.860
Okay.

115
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.720
Now, what we can basically do is type in.

116
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.840
The full name is Mark Holly.

117
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.090
My.

118
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.250
And the email is.

119
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.510
This is my email.

120
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.920
You can contact me through this.

121
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.790
My colleague.

122
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.730
Famous at Gitmo.

123
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.610
That's calm.

124
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.830
The password is we can just say be g-a-y embassy.

125
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.540
But most of the time you won't want to store the password.

126
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.040
This is going to be a secret.

127
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.800
Okay, so we can click on sign up.

128
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.150
Okay, great.

129
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.860
You can see it via McCauley and the email is.

130
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.700
Locally famous and the password is Big Mac.

131
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.760
But most of the time you don't really need to store the.

132
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.280
Big Mac.

133
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.900
That is a password since it is a secret between the help and the user.

134
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.360
So this is basically it.

135
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:12.920
So in general, in order to grab user inputs, all you just have to do is to create a test editor controller.

136
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.570
So this is for the full name.

137
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.270
This is for the email and this is for the password.

138
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:24.860
And all we simply did was to bind it to each of the test fields whereby I said the test field has the

139
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.320
property known as controller.

140
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.770
So we bind it to this.

141
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.770
And over here where we have this button, we simply wrapped it with a function.

142
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.370
Sorry.

143
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.240
We simply wrapped it with a button.

144
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.350
And the on top part is the on top is a function, right?

145
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.560
And we are basically printing everything immediately.

146
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.170
The button is tapped, but if we don't see, understand, you can do well to let me know.

147
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:56.740
We can also have other editor instead of this we can say McClay That is the name of my company.

148
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.640
McClay care the me.

149
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.780
Okay.

150
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.360
Okay.

151
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.040
Click on sign up.

152
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.120
Taken it many times and go check here.

153
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.840
Seminar.

154
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.200
You go sit over there.

155
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.390
You can see my Clay Academy, the name of my company.

156
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.610
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
