00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.780
Now, currently we are logged in, but if I should also restart, this is going to take us back to the

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.540
login page and that's me as a user is going to need to log in all the time.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.080
They want to use our hub, but we're not gonna be needing this.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.620
That's what I going to do is once the user logs in, you're going to save that section.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.770
So the user needs to log in all the time.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.310
They desire to use our hub that you can see currently because our hearts we started this, we are currently

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.300
back to the login page and for me to use this app again I need to log in, which I think is a very bad

10
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.810
design.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.960
So what you're going to do is we're going to save that user section.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.980
So the log in, you don't need to log in again.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.070
I'll probably see the log outs themselves.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.850
Okay.

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.370
Now to do this, I will go to the size.

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.970
They're going to go to the odds controller okay.

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.430
But before we do this, please note there are a variety of ways to achieve the same results.

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.100
So there are probably other way to do this and you're going to get exactly the same results.

19
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.910
Okay.

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.210
So the pattern I'm going to be using to do this over, you know, create.

21
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.970
It needs to be Harriers as well.

22
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.550
Then are going to pass in the user.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.580
The user we are percent is not the user model but the hearts user.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.450
Okay.

25
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.280
E hearts user.

26
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.900
Okay.

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.590
So now.

28
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.150
What we can do now.

29
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.660
We can.

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.850
Had this as well.

31
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.660
Then we can say create the rainbow or this core user.

32
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.130
Okay, good.

33
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.440
Now, what they're going to do next is.

34
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.210
We are just going to do this over here.

35
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.710
I want to say on.

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.760
On ready.

37
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.920
And the reason for this already is immediately the half load is going to fire and it's seems we are

38
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.550
going to hard.

39
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.720
Over here.

40
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.260
Okay.

41
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.080
So what they're going to do?

42
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.450
They're going to sit on this score user, which is very well created, is going to be equal to the arrowheads

43
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.960
as well.

44
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.220
Then.

45
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.770
I was able to pass in the offseason.

46
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.690
They were able to say, it can't be.

47
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.140
No.

48
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.570
Then this year we can see if these dots.

49
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.250
Correct.

50
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.940
So families ought.

51
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.990
And it's quite a user to get the current user.

52
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.530
Okay.

53
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.940
Now as we're going to see on this call, user is equal to.

54
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.290
So first I will divide the user to a stream.

55
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.430
So I'm going to say user does bind stream.

56
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.770
Now regardless of Firebase.

57
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.010
Five days art not.

58
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.040
What changes.

59
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.110
So this is going to look for odds.

60
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.060
So in all states, changes is going to look for you but is going to look for changes.

61
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.870
Okay.

62
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.410
So now what we can do.

63
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.050
Lastly, we can see over.

64
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.370
Okay.

65
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.610
Now, he's asking for the list now because he wants a listing for the user.

66
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.220
Okay.

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.370
Now for the callback we can create a function or via.

68
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.860
We can see a lot of skill sets in.

69
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.490
Nisha.

70
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.040
Oh, I can spell Nisha.

71
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.660
Initials did.

72
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.130
Okay, great.

73
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.560
Now I'm just going to copy this function and then create it all via.

74
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.450
Then, as well as being a very card user then is going to be a type of user.

75
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.340
Right.

76
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.030
Okay.

77
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.780
Now what you are going to do.

78
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.350
We are going to check if we have data, that is if we have been use our data, that is if the user is

79
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.470
logged in or if we have any logged in user.

80
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.360
So to do this, we're going to say is.

81
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.170
If user.

82
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:34.770
Is equal to know that if we don't have any user, then we just want to say get.

83
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.240
That's.

84
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.330
Of all we want to do.

85
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.160
It's on the log in.

86
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.720
Log in.

87
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.400
Log in screen.

88
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.120
Okay.

89
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.340
What if we have a user?

90
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.060
So there's going to be a house that is the opposite of.

91
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.100
Not equal to.

92
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.740
So because this is a quota.

93
00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.820
No.

94
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.110
So the air should be.

95
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.740
If is.

96
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.200
It is equal to no.

97
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.580
That means we don't have any use.

98
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.610
We just don't do it all the lobbyist else.

99
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.010
We are going to see a gets.

100
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.710
That of all then is going to be the whole screen.

101
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.070
Offscreen screen.

102
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.210
Okay.

103
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.990
So what I basically saying, we are saying if we don't have any user, then we want to keep the log

104
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.370
in screen health.

105
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.850
If we have a user, then also it's on the home screen.

106
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.360
Okay.

107
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.760
Now, currently, I think we don't have.

108
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.710
And these are right.

109
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.870
So, first of all, we're just going to.

110
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.870
We will certainly look to the right.

111
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.290
Okay.

112
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.840
So I just got the heart in Sturgis.

113
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.290
Hopefully my network is wide.

114
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.690
Those are going to wait for the output.

115
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.590
But.

116
00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.240
Okay.

117
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080
Check it for us.

118
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.790
Okay.

119
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.100
Okay, great.

120
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.490
Now you can see we already have a user because we recently logged in.

121
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.160
So now even if you had to start this, you don't need to log in all the time again.

122
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.350
Now, if you don't understand is that we'll just know from this part.

123
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.790
From.

124
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.970
To this fight is to save this section.

125
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.440
Right.

126
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.250
Probably in this lecture, I'm going to explain a bit more deeper.

127
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.540
Okay.

128
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.660
So anytime we decide to use, we have we don't need to log in all the time again.

129
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.380
Okay, guys, see in.
