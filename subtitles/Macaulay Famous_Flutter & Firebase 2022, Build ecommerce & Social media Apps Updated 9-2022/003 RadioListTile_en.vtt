00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.780
Ies work in this lecture we are going to have up to three radio buttons.

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.300
Why not to do this?

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.100
We turn the container.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.920
We can then have a chart.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.250
And like I said, we are going to have up to three radio buttons and they are going to be displayed

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.180
vertically.

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.320
So for this purpose, we are going to be using a column.

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.600
Equal on widget and children.

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.990
And I think it scored video.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.840
With you least list.

11
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.480
And it has a property known as value, which is basically referring to each radio button we have.

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.520
And this is going to be the first.

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.770
So we can just say one and four, now we can say one.

14
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.420
And it also has a property known as On Change, which is going to take in the value of what we are selecting.

15
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.100
Okay, great.

16
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.720
And we can have a train, comma and via a comma in this country and has to save.

17
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.210
And that's to give this a very good format.

18
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.680
Okay.

19
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.950
And also within the radio list, it has a property known as title.

20
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.920
And for the title, it's going to be a test widget.

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.120
And you can just go also with an icon widget.

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.840
Okay.

23
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.730
We're just going to say cash on delivery.

24
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.040
Okay.

25
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.770
It also has a property known as subtitle, which is going to be at the bottom of the title.

26
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.050
You can also have a test widget and be type or whatever you want to be.

27
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.070
Okay.

28
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.060
You know, you can just type or save or maybe if you have that title, you can just have the whatsoever

29
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.640
you want it to be there.

30
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.270
Okay.

31
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.330
For that title, it's going to be right after this cash on delivery.

32
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.870
Okay.

33
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.900
I'm just going to show you this subtitle.

34
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.400
It can also be a test widget and we can just say pay.

35
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.639
A pay or payment from.

36
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.120
Com.

37
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.800
Okay.

38
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.010
And you want to say to.

39
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.910
Right after this.

40
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.530
Cash on delivery test.

41
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.550
Okay.

42
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.730
Okay.

43
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.400
Sounds good.

44
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.700
And now we can just copy this.

45
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.970
And is this this is going to be the second video button.

46
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.010
So we have to say the second and this is going to be the third.

47
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.930
And we also do have to say, Ted, and maybe this can be.

48
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.070
Pay with card.

49
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.930
Okay.

50
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.420
And you can just get rid of this subtitle or you can just hold any tests you so desire.

51
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.570
Okay.

52
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.550
And this could be maybe pay a payment.

53
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.620
With Stripe.

54
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.760
Okay.

55
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.570
Go check this out and you should see off the theory.

56
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.480
Okay.

57
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.780
And what we want to do now is when we click on this, we want to be able to switch between each radio

58
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.410
button.

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.830
To do this, we need to update the you are right.

60
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.910
And in order to update the UI, we have to use the state.

61
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.220
And in order to use this state, we have to use a state for widgets.

62
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.390
So what we can then do is we have to change this to a stateful widget and over here we can then create

63
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.700
a variable is going to be a type of int and we can call this selected item and default is going to be

64
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.930
equal to zero.

65
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.270
Okay.

66
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.860
And.

67
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.000
Within this function.

68
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.060
We can then see, said State.

69
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.750
Said State and the selected.

70
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.330
Item is going to be the value.

71
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.100
Okay.

72
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.860
And you can see we have this error.

73
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.200
And the reason for this is because we have to pass the type of variable we are expecting.

74
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.560
It is a type of end and we also need this.

75
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.520
It can be no.

76
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.750
And how this.

77
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.860
And also, instead of this group value, we can then use that variable we have called selected item.

78
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.900
And this is basically it's okay.

79
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.410
Now we need this.

80
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.690
We can just copy this or you can just manually type that in at that point to get used to you and you

81
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.540
can then get rid of this paste.

82
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.070
And get rid of this and paste.

83
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.700
Now.

84
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.720
Let's go check it out.

85
00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.010
Okay.

86
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.580
Sorry.

87
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.550
We also do have to change this to the selected item.

88
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.320
Selected, I tend.

89
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.440
And selected.

90
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.370
Hi, Tim.

91
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.660
Okay.

92
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.720
Control.

93
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.730
This is safe and go check it out.

94
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.320
Okay.

95
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.800
Okay.

96
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.530
Click on this.

97
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.150
Okay.

98
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.500
Click on this.

99
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.060
Okay.

100
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.820
Sounds cool.

101
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.160
And lastly, we can happen to have as well within the scaffold.

102
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.590
Okay, we already have that bar.

103
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.720
We can then have a title.

104
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.400
Crest.

105
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.340
This is going to say payment screen.

106
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.900
And also we can have the center try to to center it by saying true.

107
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.770
Okay.

108
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.970
Is control safe?

109
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.170
And you should see the way.

110
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.610
Okay.

111
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.190
Okay.

112
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.100
We have to change the color.

113
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.860
The star.

114
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.500
And colour colours that black.

115
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.750
Okay.

116
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.460
And go check it out now.

117
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.760
Okay.

118
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.690
Okay.

119
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.440
So that's cool.

120
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.350
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
