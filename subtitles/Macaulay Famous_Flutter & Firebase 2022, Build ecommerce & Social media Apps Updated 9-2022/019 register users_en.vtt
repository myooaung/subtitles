00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.860
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.410
Now, I know this must have been so boring because you have not seen this in action, but really, we

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
need to hold this for others to work.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.370
Right?

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.180
We created a function to upload.

7
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.340
The image in our storage.

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.790
Then over here is the validation of.

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:32.479
This feuds, that is, if the image is not empty, the email is not empty, the password is not at.

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.500
Then over here, if it is not empty, then this is going to.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.090
That's the struggle to create a user with email and password.

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.600
Then as well upload the image, the perfect image to our storage.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.260
Okay then as well, they're also going to upload the data in faster database.

14
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.070
So all this is going to run.

15
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.370
If only the username is not empty.

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.970
But what if it is empty?

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.120
What you can do over here.

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260
This is the if statement, right?

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.060
You can, as we have on the house statements so we can see House.

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.420
We can use the.

21
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.280
Get it.

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.900
Snack bar again.

23
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.620
Okay.

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.320
Now the title of the arrow.

25
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.570
It can either be here or.

26
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.530
Creating.

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.370
Accounts.

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.480
Okay.

29
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.680
Now, the message is going to be probably.

30
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.830
Please.

31
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.240
Can just use calculator appropriately to please and to all fits.

32
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.640
Okay.

33
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.030
So if the if the email adds a name you the image is empty.

34
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.320
If the username the email is empty then he's going to run this his spots over.

35
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.460
If not is going to just run the if plot that is going to create the user will do email and password.

36
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.960
Then as well you're going to upload the photo you are to him.

37
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.400
So I storage then as well upload all the details to a faster database.

38
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.770
Okay.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.890
Now what I'm going to do on this, we are going to call this.

40
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.530
Functional code registered user.

41
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.130
Now you can see this is more like a salt of the water controller.

42
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.900
So now for us to gain access to this register user, we need to gain access to the controller.

43
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.290
They need to gain access or be able to use this controller.

44
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.160
Okay, let me just show you this.

45
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.770
Now, first of all, if we just go to our sign up.

46
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.910
Now over the.

47
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.380
The I think this is the sign of.

48
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.950
Right.

49
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.730
Okay.

50
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.340
Digital via and.

51
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.770
We did not trust it, which is what's in the dirt.

52
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.170
I think we did not.

53
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.800
I hope this is a sign of.

54
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.120
Okay, this is a sign of change.

55
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.570
Right.

56
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.520
So what we are going to do.

57
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.540
Already sent the Colorado Suites an equal.

58
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.290
So you call clickable graph with widget.

59
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.200
Okay.

60
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.820
Therapeutics Inc.

61
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.330
Inkwell.

62
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.280
Okay.

63
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.350
Good.

64
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.300
Now, this inkwell has the on top, right?

65
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.220
So we can see on top.

66
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.560
You can just use an arrow function.

67
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.710
Okay.

68
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.570
What's that?

69
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.790
Plus our assets to that a sore user.

70
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.880
We need to have access to the auto controller or its controller.

71
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.380
What if, as you said, Dot, you can see we don't have access to that.

72
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.260
Okay.

73
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.290
We don't have access to the register user.

74
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.570
That's our access to the registered user.

75
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.459
What we can do is over the whole controller.

76
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.970
First of all, I'm just going to contribute to I think we have an in here or.

77
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.510
You can click on this.

78
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.990
Think it's going to take you.

79
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.330
Okay?

80
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.690
We just need to hide the semicolon.

81
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.780
That thing.

82
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.200
So.

83
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.640
Let's check those.

84
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.240
Okay.

85
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.850
Okay was gone.

86
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.940
So I needed to have the semicolon not to have access to it or we just have to do over here.

87
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.550
Is this toxic?

88
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.330
Static.

89
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.430
The old controller class.

90
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.880
Odds controller durability distance is going to be equal to get dirt.

91
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.660
Find.

92
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.960
Great.

93
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.450
So it is now you can have access to these register user.

94
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.450
Now what you can do over the course.

95
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.730
So this is going to be using this auto controller.

96
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.370
Often times I'm going to go to the cost.

97
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.890
Okay.

98
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.330
The.

99
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.380
The cost of our.

100
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.940
I won't lose control of it to make this wide.

101
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.630
Then as well, you can just how to combat this passive controller.

102
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.810
Okay.

103
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.060
So now we can create a able.

104
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.760
You can see Calder's art controller ods on.

105
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.110
Chula.

106
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.110
He's going to be equal to what?

107
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.930
Okay.

108
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.470
It's controller.

109
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.910
Okay.

110
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.080
Dot Eastern.

111
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.400
Okay, great.

112
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.030
So now over a year.

113
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.010
We can see its controller that is that very well created.

114
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.000
Let's controller that we considered register user.

115
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.230
Okay, great.

116
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:35.090
Now you can see districts, the user name is picked, the email inspects the password and the image.

117
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.450
Right.

118
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.030
Because those are the fields we have created for the registered user function.

119
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.610
Now what you can do is to have access to the value of the user name imputes.

120
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.920
What I'm going to do is.

121
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.430
Over.

122
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.190
Yeah.

123
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.930
We're going to create a controller so you can see it.

124
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.290
I'll just call you down and we can just make this firebase easily accessible within this way so we can

125
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.720
see is equal to test.

126
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.440
Just a detail controller.

127
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.420
Okay, great.

128
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.670
Now we can associate these.

129
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.910
Is a fine is a type of test editing controller.

130
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.590
Okay, good.

131
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.930
Now, we also able to create for the.

132
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.520
Email.

133
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.250
And password.

134
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.580
Right.

135
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.200
So it his this.

136
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.520
Okay.

137
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.930
So it is going to be.

138
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:53.360
So there's going to be email and this is going to be for the password.

139
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.430
Okay.

140
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.530
Great.

141
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.970
It is going to get rid of this.

142
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.060
Okay.

143
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.080
Now we're going to go to our first few.

144
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.160
That is the username.

145
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.590
Now the password policy controller.

146
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.630
It's going to be on this call the user name.

147
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.780
So we it we have the value the user is going to type in.

148
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.780
Okay so for the.

149
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.570
I think this is for.

150
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.470
The email.

151
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.610
So you're going to see control as well.

152
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.100
Sorry.

153
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.070
Sorry is going to be a controller.

154
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.549
Controller is going to be on this call in email.

155
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.150
Okay.

156
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.659
Great.

157
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.909
So now for the password as well is going to be controller.

158
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.130
It is going to be on it's called password.

159
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.630
So by doing this, we have the controller is going to do this for the value.

160
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.820
This is going to type in.

161
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.830
So it's going to grab that value.

162
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.330
So over here.

163
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.160
What you can't do.

164
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.740
So this is going to be what is called username.

165
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.150
Standardized tests.

166
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.400
Okay.

167
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:10.690
Good.

168
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.070
So this is going to be.

169
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.670
On this score.

170
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.250
It will not just.

171
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.100
For this.

172
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.260
It is going to be on his call password the test.

173
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.340
Okay.

174
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:34.110
Now for the image, I can also create a function so able to pick an image from our gallery right now

175
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.410
that I will be able to do that in this lecture.

176
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.650
I think this is getting very long.

177
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.360
Now what you can do.

178
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.820
Make sure you don't close this files because of this error.

179
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.220
You'll hardly see the road.

180
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:52.370
So for now, you can easily just commit this house if you know you are going to close this file.

181
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:57.310
Because if you do close this fight because of that, this error over here is over the road.

182
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.850
So you can just get rid of this.

183
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.040
