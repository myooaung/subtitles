00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.040
Welcome.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.520
In this lecture, we are going to talk about cached network image.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.100
What this is going to help us do is it will help us show images from the Internet and it will also help

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.460
us keep them in the cache directory.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.120
Okay.

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.360
Now to install this, first of all, you have to head up to pop dot dev and over here you have to search

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
for cached network image.

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.190
And we are going to click on this first link and now we can then copy this code and back to VS code

10
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:54.000
and head up to your post peg demo fi and you have to paste it and you can see incrementally I have it.

11
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.280
Okay.

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.210
And now you have to use control and save.

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.040
Then click on get package.

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.830
Sorry, just control and save is enough.

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.610
It will then automatically start getting the package.

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.210
Okay.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.420
And after that, we have to go back to the profile screen.

18
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:26.160
And use contrarian be and now within the scaffold we can then have the body property and for the body

19
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.970
we are going to have multiple widgets which are going to be displayed vertically.

20
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420
That is from top to bottom.

21
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.660
So what we can just do is we can have a column as is parents widgets column.

22
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.710
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets.

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.610
So it has these children as is property and the first child is going to be a row.

24
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.220
You're going to see why we are is in a row.

25
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.270
Okay.

26
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.610
And the row can also take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed horizontally.

27
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.000
Right.

28
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.700
That is from left to right.

29
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.320
Okay.

30
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.650
And now we can then use a widget known as Clip Over, click over.

31
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.060
Okay.

32
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.100
You can over in this to see what basically does.

33
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.210
Okay.

34
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.690
And now we can have a chart.

35
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.330
And for the chart we are then going to use that package we just installed Cat Network.

36
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.050
Image.

37
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.820
Okay.

38
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.230
The Cash Network image has a property known as Fields, which is basically referring to how we want

39
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.600
to display the image.

40
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:59.270
And we can then say box fields, dot cover and also how the newcomer and the cached network image has

41
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.590
all has a property known as Image Your Hell, which is referring to the source of the image.

42
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.220
And for now what we can just do is leave it empty.

43
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.330
In the future we are going to be able to retrieve the profile, the user image.

44
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.850
Okay.

45
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.790
And now also we can give it height to this image.

46
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.590
We can say we want a height of hundred, and also we can give a width to the image that is how wide

47
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.430
it's going to be.

48
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.400
And the height has to do with how long it's going to be.

49
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.000
And for the width we can also give on red.

50
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.410
Okay.

51
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:49.970
And now the cash network image also has a property known as Place Order, which is referring to if the

52
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.090
image has not showed up yet, what else do we want to show?

53
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.420
And for this, what we have to do is we have to pass the contest over this parentheses and the URL.

54
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.930
And we're just going to use another function and say if we do not have any images to share, we then

55
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.529
want to show secular secular progress.

56
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.140
Progress indicator.

57
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.019
Okay.

58
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:28.030
And of course, it also has a property known as a hero widget.

59
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.880
And also we have to create this parenthesis and it's going to take the contest contest and the URL of

60
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.650
the image and also the last property is going to take is the hero.

61
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.910
Okay.

62
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.790
And then we can use an arrow function.

63
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.350
Okay.

64
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.920
To say we want to return a icon with at.

65
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.940
And this is going to be icons that maybe era.

66
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.100
Okay.

67
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.210
And this is basically it.

68
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.420
Now, how do you trying to come over there and what is that?

69
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.150
If we don't understand, you can do well to let me know.

70
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.470
And I'm fully available to support you any time, any day.

71
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.850
Okay.

72
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.410
Flip over.

73
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.510
Okay.

74
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.850
Most of the time you can just copy and I think I have the.

75
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.120
Okay.

76
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.060
Sorry, we just have to check this first before I explain that.

77
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.620
Okay.

78
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.110
Click on this profile.

79
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.010
So I think.

80
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.390
Okay.

81
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:44.860
You can see currently we have no image and this circle progress circle, our progress indicator has

82
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:54.220
been displayed and what we can do is within the row we can then set -- alignment and main axis alignment

83
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.590
or center meaning us alignment.

84
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.340
Main us.

85
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.860
Okay.

86
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.710
Dot center to take it to the center.

87
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.650
Okay, wait for this and you can see why we are basically using the column widget.

88
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.160
And the reason for this column is because we want all our widgets to be displayed vertically.

89
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.030
That is from top to bottom.

90
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.250
And within the column widgets we are using error widgets.

91
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.890
And the reason for this is we want to have a.

92
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.250
An image over our year right there, maybe something of our year, right.

93
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:48.330
So what we will basically do is it will help us display our image horizontally, that is from left to

94
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.930
right.

95
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:57.030
While a column widget will help us display our widgets vertically, we can see why we are basically

96
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.150
using a column to wrap everything up.

97
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.780
Because also after this row we can.

98
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.780
Come out from its.

99
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.430
But I didn't come here and maybe have another test.

100
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.340
I'm just going to type something gibberish.

101
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.970
Okay.

102
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.410
Why is there this error?

103
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.370
Test.

104
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.380
He's trying to save and it's going to be here.

105
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.350
Right, he concedes.

106
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.820
And if we are still within the rule, we can then have another test.

107
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.560
And.

108
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.640
Type something gibberish.

109
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.620
And you're going to see it over here.

110
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.920
You can see the via.

111
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.970
Okay.

112
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.910
So you can see what the difference between rural and coal, right?

113
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.850
So what we have to do is to get rid of it.

114
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.230
I'm basically just showing you.

115
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.810
Okay.

116
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.630
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
