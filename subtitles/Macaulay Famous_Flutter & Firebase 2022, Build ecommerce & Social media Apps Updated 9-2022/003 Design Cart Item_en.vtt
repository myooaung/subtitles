00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.610
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.540
In this lecture, we are going to design the cards item screen not to do this.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.560
We are going to go to the cards, screen, cards, screen, and we can use contra and B to make this

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.720
wide OC and instead of returning the test widgets, we can get rid of this first and we are going to

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.530
return a card widget and we can give this card a height.

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.940
To do that, we have to sit.

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.610
Right.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.890
And this is going to be size box.

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.200
Size box.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.170
Okay.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.570
And now we can give the height of hundred.

13
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.930
Okay.

14
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.020
He is trying to save.

15
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.610
Okay.

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.170
And within the size box it has a property known as child, and the child is going to be a real widget.

17
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.720
And I believe you already know what a role does.

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.709
Role and role can take multiple widgets.

19
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.290
And the first site is going to be another size box.

20
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.070
And the reason for this is we want to have the image and basically we want to give this image a height

21
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.080
and a weight so we can then say, right, height is going to be 100.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.400
And we'd.

23
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.720
It's going to be maybe 120 och this and och, och.

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.260
Nothing is missing.

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.970
And how do you try to come to format?

26
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.180
Okay.

27
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.920
And now we in the size box, we can have the child.

28
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.050
The child is going to be image.

29
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.570
Image DOD network.

30
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.440
Image net.

31
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.770
Sorry.

32
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.010
Okay.

33
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.860
And this is going to be card provider.

34
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.780
Card provider.

35
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.790
Provide our kids items and we want to assess each item by the index and then dot what image images you

36
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.970
are.

37
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.440
Well.

38
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.510
Okay.

39
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.660
And maybe we have to say dots to string.

40
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.250
Okay.

41
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.030
And also what we want to do is we want to display the first image of that product.

42
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.220
To do that over here, we have to have this and say zero.

43
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.470
Because definitely the product has or can have multiple images.

44
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.100
And over here, what we are simply saying is we want to display the first image of that product.

45
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.490
And now how to train and use control and as to save.

46
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.920
And you should see it's over.

47
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.890
Yet you can see we already have the cards.

48
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.160
Okay, Cisco.

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.300
Right.

50
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.640
And you can see from this part to the spot is on the right.

51
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.510
And the image is 100%, 100% height and one 20% width.

52
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.610
Okay.

53
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.690
And now we can display the name of the product over here.

54
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.470
To do that, we can just use a column widget for this.

55
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.590
And the reason for this column is because over here we're going to have the name of the products and

56
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.220
over here we are going to have the price of the products.

57
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.860
To do that within the row.

58
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.130
Okay.

59
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.870
Tend to rule.

60
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.450
We can then have a column.

61
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.430
A column widget.

62
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.080
And a column can take multiple widgets.

63
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.800
And the first widget is going to be a test widget.

64
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.690
And now this is going to be cut provider, cut provider standard.

65
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:09.130
What that gets items and we want to assess each item and basically the name of the product like this

66
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.230
and use control and save.

67
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.370
Okay.

68
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.030
You should say it's over.

69
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.310
Over.

70
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.140
Yeah.

71
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.709
Okay.

72
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.670
Sounds good, right?

73
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.200
Okay.

74
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.910
And assuming we have a very long product name, what we can do is we can wrap this with something known

75
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.930
as flexible.

76
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.100
If not, we are going to have an overflow here.

77
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.930
I don't think we have this widget over here.

78
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.350
So we can just wrap this with a widget and this is going to be flex.

79
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.500
Flexi.

80
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.840
Flexible.

81
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.080
Flexible.

82
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.960
Okay.

83
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.550
And this.

84
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.090
Sorry.

85
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.640
Okay.

86
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.190
He's trying to save.

87
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.080
Okay.

88
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.340
And lastly, within the test widget, it has a property.

89
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.300
It sends.

90
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.840
Okay.

91
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.910
Train a camera.

92
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.220
It has the property known as mudslide.

93
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.600
We can set this to two.

94
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.630
And the reason for this is, maybe in the future we can have a very long product name.

95
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.380
So this will basically get rid of the overflow.

96
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.830
Here is control and has to save.

97
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.430
Okay.

98
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.300
Okay.

99
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.020
Sounds good.

100
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.790
And we can start this.

101
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.360
A date.

102
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.830
This is going to be sti.

103
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.850
Test.

104
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.070
STI.

105
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.590
The star.

106
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.770
We can increase the font size to 16 and we can then say font weight.

107
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.090
Font.

108
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.350
France, which.

109
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.890
Funds with.

110
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.540
That would.

111
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.310
Okay.

112
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.360
Okay.

113
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.630
Our digital camera and use controller and se to save.

114
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.740
Okay.

115
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.970
And let's go check this out.

116
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.590
Okay.

117
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.820
And lastly, maybe you can have a color.

118
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.920
This is going to be colors that.

119
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.310
Gray.

120
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.500
This country needs to save.

121
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.750
Okay.

122
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.780
I think we can just get rid of this for now.

123
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.720
Okay.

124
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.080
And in the next lecture, we are going to display the price and we are going to have the quantity,

125
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.840
and that is the decrements and increments over here.

126
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.860
Okay, guys.
