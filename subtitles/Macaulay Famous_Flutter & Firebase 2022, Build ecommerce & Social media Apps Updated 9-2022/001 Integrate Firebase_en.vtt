Okay.

23
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.530
Now this is going to take some time.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.080
Okay.

25
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.300
Okay.

26
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.890
We just have to wait a bit.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.980
Okay.

33
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
Now you're going to be integrated for the hundred, right?

34
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.650
So we're going to click on under it.

35
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.110
You can easily check it out to do that for hours.

36
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.920
Okay.

37
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.110
That's asking for the package name.

38
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.840
Now, if you go over over this, you can see it is telling you the location to get the package name.

39
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.950
You can see your package name is generally the application ID in your house.

40
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.180
There will be a descriptor.

41
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.590
Okay.

42
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.840
So now we're going to go to our visa code.

43
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.140
Okay.

44
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.410
Then we're going to go to price.

45
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.850
Okay.

46
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.350
First of all, I will collapse.

47
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.720
This ACC is asking for the android and the app level.

48
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.320
Okay.

49
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.950
This is the bill.

50
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:01.790
Third grader.

51
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.270
Okay.

52
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.180
Now what is control and B to make this wider?

53
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.200
Okay.

54
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.940
Now, what first I can do is instead of using the com example, we can make it unique by using our user

55
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.200
name so we can insert my colleague in my spot.

56
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.940
I believe your username is going to be different.

57
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.240
Right?

58
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.630
Okay.

59
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.010
But I escort you and they're safe, and I'm going to copy this.

60
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.730
After this.

61
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.290
Okay.

62
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.590
Don't forget to use your whole username.

63
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.190
Okay.

64
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.960
Now we're going to place this year.

65
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.690
Okay.

66
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.850
Now he's asking for the nickname.

67
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.820
We can just it up.

68
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.730
Okay.

69
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.930
Now I'm going to click on register.

70
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.880
Have.

71
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.170
Okay.

72
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.850
It's going to take some time as well.

73
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.870
Okay.

74
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.530
Nice, Don.

75
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.930
Now, the nurse that we're going to do is we're going to download this Google Docs JSON.

76
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.310
Now you can see it.

77
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.520
This is the location asking is asking us to have it.

78
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.250
So these are the point of view in and rescue logos and the USA Code is asking us to have this to the

79
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.380
Android app level.

80
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.730
Okay.

81
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.780
Okay.

82
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.840
So now what we're going to do is we're going to go to size.

83
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.120
Videos.

84
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.790
Sorry, not videos, but loads.

85
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.020
Okay, now I'm going to cut this off since I've never been needing a ticket.

86
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.250
Okay.

87
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.840
We're going to go to text stubs.

88
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.170
They're going to go to call us up.

89
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.540
They're going to go 200.

90
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.990
You're going to go to up ten.

91
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.840
You can see it wants us to taste its.

92
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.920
It's in the source code as well.

93
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.050
So we're going to finish this year.

94
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.220
Okay, great.

95
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.040
Now we're going to click on Nest.

96
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.940
Okay.

97
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.030
Now over here is asking us to have this line over here and not to get to this line.

98
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.250
We need to go to the project level, build the cradle.

99
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.120
So now we're going to call status, right?

100
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.900
Of course it is.

101
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.550
Okay.

102
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.380
Now, this is the third yet, right?

103
00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.399
And this should be the third grade.

104
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.600
Okay.

105
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.000
I'm trying to make this slide.

106
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.440
Okay.

107
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.610
He's asking us to assist.

108
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.480
It's here, so we're going to copy this.

109
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.370
Then we're going to face it here.

110
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.740
Okay.

111
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.840
We're trying to save.

112
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.120
Okay.

113
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.020
And as we are going to go down now, all I can say is that we should have this line.

114
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.150
Okay.

115
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.820
Is the Toronto Star just at the hop level?

116
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.300
So now I'm going to set this up like a plug in.

117
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.710
Okay.

118
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.230
We're trying to make this simple.

119
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.360
Again, this is the upper level.

120
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.770
This is the view of.

121
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.050
Great.

122
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.400
All right.

123
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.280
The cable can't be to make this wider in a little business over here.

124
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.940
Okay.

125
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.830
He's going to try to save as well.

126
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.210
Okay.

127
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:29.560
And lastly, I think it's OneSource to have this implementation platform in the same half level build

128
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.290
Gradle.

129
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.790
Okay.

130
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.140
So.

131
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.890
This is it for a year.

132
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.900
You're not going to see this in yours.

133
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.950
I did it when I was facing an issue and created the project.

134
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.920
So you're not going to see this line of code of.

135
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.840
I so don't think of us in that.

136
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.400
Okay.

137
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.090
Tis this.

138
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.570
Okay.

139
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.040
Okay, great.

140
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.180
Now control.

141
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.110
And to save.

142
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.970
Okay.

143
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.020
Click on.

144
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.870
Nest.

145
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.320
Okay.

146
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.510
I think that is all they are going to click on go to continue to console.

147
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.530
Okay.

148
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.020
Now what you can do is you can click on this quantification.

149
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.670
Then they're going to click on Get Started.

150
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.750
Okay.

151
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.570
They are going to be using username.

152
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.960
Log in on password, log in.

153
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.010
So now what they need to do is not to use the user name.

154
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.510
So the email and password you need to enable this.

155
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.920
So we recommend regular label for the email and password.

156
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.050
So now they're going to anybody's going to click on Save.

157
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.330
Okay, great.

158
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.850
Okay.

159
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.640
So what I was going to do is I take over.

160
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.170
Okay.

161
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.240
Over this part config.

162
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.630
They're going to do some edits.

163
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.690
And first of all, the minimum SDK, they're going to change it to.

164
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.190
So you still want.

165
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.420
Okay, great.

166
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.450
Great.

167
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.990
Now use control and this.

168
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.670
Just save.

169
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.930
Okay, great.

170
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.190
Okay.

171
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.680
Okay.

172
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:36.350
So that is how basically you're going to be using to to create your fan base, sue your heart.

173
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.110
Okay, guys, see this?
