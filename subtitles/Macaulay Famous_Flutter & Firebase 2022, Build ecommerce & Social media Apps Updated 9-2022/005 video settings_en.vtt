00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.860
In the last lecture, we were able to pick a video from our gallery, and we also said Email the user,

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.070
peak, a video we then watch, navigate that user to the screen.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.610
Okay, so now in this lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to set up the configuration and

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.770
that's a play that's picked up video.

7
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.460
Okay, not to do this, we're gonna need to go to the screen, okay?

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.450
And now we can use culture and beats and make this white.

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.850
Okay?

10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.500
Now, what I'm going to do is over here, we're going to create a variable.

11
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.490
Okay.

12
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.300
We can say fine.

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.370
And they represent the B type of fire, and we can call this video Fi.

14
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.750
Okay.

15
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.430
Now via a light and use controlled dots.

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.060
You're going to need to import the dots IO and not the HTML.

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.920
You're going to get an error.

18
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.240
Okay.

19
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.390
That is the peak video file, right?

20
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.780
Okay.

21
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.610
We also need the parts of the video so we can save video parts.

22
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.880
And that is what we are going to store in the database.

23
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.270
Okay.

24
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.120
Now use control and that's okay.

25
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.050
Sorry.

26
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.190
Video parts.

27
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.630
Video parts.

28
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.520
Right.

29
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.890
Okay.

30
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.220
Not in this to do is to pass it on to the constructor.

31
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.580
Right.

32
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.000
Okay.

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
So over here we can use country and Dot and create constructor.

34
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.570
We'll find out first.

35
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.940
Okay.

36
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.220
Now we can actually make this null.

37
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.400
That's means whenever we call this our screen, we don't really need to pass in the value to this video

38
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.340
pass and this video with this video fly and this video path as well.

39
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.790
Okay.

40
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.150
Well, what we're going to do is we're going to make it a required field.

41
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.780
So whenever we call this screen, we're going to need to pass in the values to this variables.

42
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.460
Okay.

43
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.810
So we can then say required and.

44
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.780
Well, they're required.

45
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.450
Okay.

46
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.860
And now we're going to get an error up because we are using this calfskin wire and it expects us to

47
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.200
pass the value to this video and the value to the video parts.

48
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.090
Okay, great.

49
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.789
So now we're going to get rid of this for now and.

50
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.790
Go back to the conference screen.

51
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.260
Okay.

52
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.950
Okay.

53
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.380
Now, what we're going to do is.

54
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.600
Over a year.

55
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.590
Okay.

56
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.680
We're going to do this.

57
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.740
Okay.

58
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.390
First of all, we're going to be using this in these states.

59
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
And the reason for this in these states is we weren't merely the user.

60
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.760
The user is navigated to this screen.

61
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
We want to automatically play that video.

62
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.420
Okay.

63
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.850
So to do that, we're going to be using the in states and you cannot use that in this state, in the

64
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.780
state, less widgets.

65
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.710
So what we have to do is to convert this widget to stateful widgets.

66
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.220
So to do that, all you just have to do is a light and use country dots and create.

67
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.150
Sorry, create, sorry.

68
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.050
Stateful widgets.

69
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.760
Okay, great.

70
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.750
Now, this is basically it's not a play that's picked video.

71
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.260
They're going to be using that package we just historic so we can sell it because we don't want to initialize

72
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.440
what we are going to do now and it's going to be a type of video controller and we can see a controller.

73
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.910
You can see we can as we'll just say video controller.

74
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.080
But we don't want to do this at the moment that says we don't want to initialize this at the moment.

75
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.380
So we have to use the late to more like say wait for me.

76
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.670
I don't want to do this now.

77
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.150
Okay.

78
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.230
Okay.

79
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.400
Now, like I said, email.

80
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.620
The user gets navigated to this page.

81
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.170
We want to automatically play that video.

82
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.590
Right.

83
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.040
Okay.

84
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.890
So to do that, we're going to be using what's the interstate?

85
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.860
And we can get rid of this.

86
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.930
And over year we can then use the state in order to automatically rebuild our widgets.

87
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.680
Okay, so you're going to call that controller.

88
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.940
Like I said, they're going to be setting up the settings in order to play that video.

89
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.270
Right.

90
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.660
Okay.

91
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.520
So over this controller, we are going to need to say controller.

92
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.510
Controller dart watch this is going to be.

93
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.170
So it controls the question.

94
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.440
Okay.

95
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.540
Now we can not initialize it.

96
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.710
Controller is request sort video controller.

97
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.060
And Via.

98
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.910
So he.

99
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.320
I think we called it this is going to be a controller as equals to.

100
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.100
Okay.

101
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.840
Video.

102
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.170
Sorry, video player.

103
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.680
Video player controller.

104
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.470
Dot.

105
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.060
So.

106
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.800
Dot fi.

107
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.690
Okay.

108
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.930
And the fire is going to be the pit video fi not to access this.

109
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.990
This is a sub variable, right?

110
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.310
So I says this webinar needs to say widget dots.

111
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.750
Video fi.

112
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.910
Okay, great.

113
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.450
Now this is the first set is and that's what's played the Peaks video.

114
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.170
Right.

115
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.680
Okay.

116
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.780
Now, we are going to do the census now.

117
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.090
So what we can say is controller.

118
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.410
Controller Dot.

119
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.040
Dot initialize.

120
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.910
Yeah.

121
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.590
I want to initialize the video.

122
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.650
And what we can also see is.

123
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.830
Video a controller.

124
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.910
Dirt play.

125
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.770
We want to play the video, definitely.

126
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.680
And we can also set the volume.

127
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.600
We can see, say, controller that sets volume.

128
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.000
You can see why.

129
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.490
Okay.

130
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.870
And as all we can see, controller.

131
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.760
Dirt.

132
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.000
I think we have we have said, look.

133
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.680
Okay.

134
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.500
So what this is going to do is whether the video stops is going to starts replaying itself.

135
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.890
Okay.

136
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.660
So this is basically all the settings we need in order to play the video.

137
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.490
Now, you don't really need all this.

138
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.620
You can basically get rid of this or you can basically had some additional settings.

139
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.200
You can basically just say controller and you can use the dots and you're going to see a lot.

140
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.410
You can see we have the we have a lots.

141
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.220
We have a lot.

142
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.570
You can see.

143
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.050
Set.

144
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.060
Set the box field set.

145
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.180
Looping sets, close capture and stick to.

146
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.790
And we have a lot where we can just go with this.

147
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.020
Okay.

148
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.280
Nine In this picture, we are definitely going to be able to play this video before.

149
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.430
Now, please do not close this five or close your record.

150
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.050
SE You won't be able to restart this app because you can see we have this error of.

151
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.630
All you can do is you can make that not required.

152
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.050
Okay, then.

153
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.080
And in this lecture, we are going to be playing.

154
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.000
You are going to be able to play the video.

155
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.540
But for now, what we can do is this country and this to save this file.

156
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.030
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
