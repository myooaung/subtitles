00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.570
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.689
Now, as you know, password are not meant to be seen when typing.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.080
So what you're going to do now?

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.710
Before then, I'm going to show you this.

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.220
Now, when we tap the you can see that this is basically just more like a test in my test field.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.260
So what I'm going to do is we're going to make this hidden.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.060
So when we type the first letter, it's going to hide that.

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.550
Okay.

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.190
So to do this is very easy.

11
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.400
We're just going to go to our log in screen page.

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.440
Okay.

13
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.400
I think okay, this is it by logging screen.

14
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.830
Now we're going to go to the password field.

15
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.530
Trust me, this is very easy.

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.670
Okay.

17
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.650
This is the password field.

18
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
Oh, just out as it is within the test field.

19
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.920
Not to impede decoration.

20
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.710
This is available in the test field and not within the decoration.

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.760
So all we just have to say is of secure test.

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630
So I'm going to set this to you.

23
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.120
Okay.

24
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.060
Okay.

25
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.820
This is save.

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.170
Now when we tap is going to hide it because it's like it's not here.

27
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.400
Okay, great.

28
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.600
Now you can see.

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.360
Again.

30
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.180
You can see goods.

31
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.410
Good.

32
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.750
Now, we're going to do this for the side of page.

33
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.710
Okay.

34
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.290
There you can see currently when you type, you can see what they are typing on user.

35
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.840
Are all the users going to visit is to have a password.

36
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.540
So now you can try that as well.

37
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.240
So to do that as well, you can do that yourself.

38
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.360
So you can a positive video and try to do that yourself.

39
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.740
Okay.

40
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.090
Okay.

41
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.710
That will do it for you.

42
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.610
We're going to do it again.

43
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.510
I say that.

44
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.000
So now we're going to go to our sign up screen.

45
00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.610
Then they're going to go to their the passwords, who I think is the last we have.

46
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.410
So this is it.

47
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.169
So evidence of secure or secure test.

48
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.699
We're going to set it to you.

49
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.740
Okay.

50
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.800
They're going to lose control.

51
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.530
And this aren't true.

52
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.240
And this to save the give away or to go.

53
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.840
Okay.

54
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.300
So now we can type here.

55
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.750
Okay.

56
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.010
You can see it right there.

57
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.750
Okay, great.

58
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.200
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
