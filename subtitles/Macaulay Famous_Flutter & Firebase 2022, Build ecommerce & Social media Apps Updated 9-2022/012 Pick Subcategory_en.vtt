00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.180
In this lecture, we are going to be able to select Subcategories for the main category.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.910
That is when we click on main category.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.160
Just Men Subcategory are going to be displayed over here when we click on the electronics, just the

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.370
electronics subcategories are going to be displayed here.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.020
Okay.

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.040
Now, in order to do this, the first step is to create a variable.

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.570
And we are going to create this variable over here and it's going to be a type of list and we are expecting

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.970
a test as is value.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.110
So this is going to be a string and we can then call this sub.

12
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.650
Category list, and we're going to set it to an empty list.

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.770
And now what we can do in order to make this dynamic.

14
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:04.930
We can get rid of this man subcategory we have to get rid of it and use the sub category list.

15
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.390
We just created this culture and save now.

16
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.740
Okay.

17
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.970
We come this.

18
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.730
You can see currently it is disable and the reason the button is disabled is because we do not have

19
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.350
any subcategory item in this list.

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
You can see we do not have any item in this list.

21
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.040
Right.

22
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.750
Sorry.

23
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.660
Over.

24
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.380
Over year, we did not have the men, let's have men and we shared and so on.

25
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.870
Maybe these are necessary.

26
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.280
We also need to shed value, right?

27
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.860
Schitt's.

28
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.580
--.

29
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.210
I think it's capital letter.

30
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.270
Okay.

31
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.160
And this is contract save and go check this out.

32
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.400
It won't be longer visible, but it's going to hurt.

33
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.390
We start this.

34
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.229
Okay.

35
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.300
We just have to wait.

36
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.090
It's going to start this now.

37
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.730
And go check upload.

38
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.860
And you can see it is no longer disabled.

39
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.280
So the reason it was disabled is because we do not have any item in this list, but we are going to

40
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.950
have item to this list dynamically.

41
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.300
Now to do this, we have to use an if statement.

42
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.890
Okay, over.

43
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.450
This said state.

44
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.000
That is the main category drop down.

45
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.100
See, we have the main category drop down over here.

46
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.490
We can for now, get rid of this set state.

47
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.830
And what we are going to do.

48
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.310
We are going to have some check.

49
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.290
We can say if you.

50
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.880
If value that is what the user is selecting is equal to sorry, double equal to the men.

51
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.720
It is equal to that, then we want to set state.

52
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.220
We want to set state and call the subcategory value.

53
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.920
Subcategory value is going to be equal to the first item we have within the subcategory of demand.

54
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.260
I think the first item is shared and now we have to update that subcategory in this variable.

55
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.300
I fully understand this.

56
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.240
I know at this point this would be very confusing.

57
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.640
Okay, now we have to call the subcategory list and we then have to set it to where the.

58
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.730
We then have to set it to the main demand category.

59
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.710
The main subcategory key.

60
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.110
What we start.

61
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.480
This second trend is to see.

62
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.330
You could check it out.

63
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.330
Okay.

64
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.710
Click on man.

65
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.480
And you can see main items are going to be displayed.

66
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.860
Okay.

67
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.220
We can also do some check for the women.

68
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.300
So what we can say is after within this we can see else we've.

69
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.050
So use multiple statement.

70
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.000
ElseIf if value.

71
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.440
Is equal to the women.

72
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.890
Who is equal to the women.

73
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.710
We didn't want to set stage.

74
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.350
And change the sub category value.

75
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.370
Sorry.

76
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.550
So category value.

77
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.130
Subcategory value.

78
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:54.840
I think the first item we have in the copy this is sorry, this I think I have it up via the first item

79
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.650
we have.

80
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.440
Okay.

81
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.650
What we can just do is we can copy this.

82
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.590
Okay.

83
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.070
And I'm going to go to.

84
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.810
The.

85
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.250
The.

86
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.140
I'm going to go to the utilities dietary.

87
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.400
Utilities.

88
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.240
Where are you?

89
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:23.930
And we in this file and I'm going to paste this right over here and I'm going to get rid of this subcategory

90
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.410
for now.

91
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.780
You're going to see why we need that later.

92
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.320
And you can see now the first item is dress within the women subcategory.

93
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.820
Okay.

94
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.630
Back to the upload.

95
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.480
So the subcategory value is going to be dressed.

96
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.770
Member, the subcategory value is basically referring to the default value.

97
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.610
So we are basically updating it to address.

98
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.280
Okay.

99
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.800
And also, we have to say Main.

100
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.660
Sorry.

101
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.630
Subcategory list.

102
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.250
This would be very confusing to you.

103
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.410
Subcategory is equal to where is equal to the women.

104
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.920
Women subcategory.

105
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.570
Okay.

106
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.510
What?

107
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.500
We start this.

108
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.280
And go check this out.

109
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.780
Okay.

110
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.350
Now, instead of men, I'm going to pick I'm going to pick a women.

111
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.330
And you can see just we may have heightened the default value.

112
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.610
You can see the stress.

113
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.130
And over here, we can choose.

114
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.780
Okay, great.

115
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.150
I'm just going to copy the rest as well.

116
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.500
But this file is going to be available to you instead of typing it.

117
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.730
You can as well just copy the codes.

118
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.140
Okay.

119
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.370
Electronics shoes and.

120
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.100
Okay.

121
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.680
I'm just going to copy from this.

122
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.960
Yeah.

123
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.980
To.

124
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.840
To.

125
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.490
This.

126
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.280
And utilities rights, utilities, statutory.

127
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.380
We have to pay this over year and we have to get rid of this subcategory test for now.

128
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.550
Okay.

129
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.220
And.

130
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.140
Get rid of it.

131
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.450
Okay.

132
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.150
Get rid of it.

133
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.240
For the beauty.

134
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.860
Get rid of it.

135
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.530
And get rid of alts.

136
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.490
Okay.

137
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.710
Choose.

138
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.670
Get rid of this.

139
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.340
And.

140
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.610
This.

141
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.160
And those are.

142
00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:00.390
And now we have to use an E statement for everything just as this.

143
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.920
So we are just going to copy.

144
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.010
This.

145
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.970
Copy.

146
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.390
And taste.

147
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.760
Okay.

148
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.780
Just going to use the elseif.

149
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.400
Okay.

150
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:25.330
And now this is going to be value equal to what it is equal to.

151
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.750
Electronics.

152
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.110
Okay.

153
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.970
And like Chronixx.

154
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.340
Hopefully I have no spelling error.

155
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.340
Like True Nyx.

156
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.860
If it's equal to electronics, then we basically want to set stage.

157
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.690
So as if.

158
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.880
Okay.

159
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.260
So.

160
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.860
Steve and now we want to set the stage to say subcategory.

161
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:11.220
So category value is going to be equal to, I think the first item we have over there is what?

162
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.750
Is what's in the electronics.

163
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.850
The first item we have is phone.

164
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:17.800
Okay.

165
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.110
And back of.

166
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.380
Is equal to foreign.

167
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.390
Okay.

168
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.260
And it's going to be quite a different story.

169
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.120
And now we have to update the subcategory.

170
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:38.180
Well, at least to say equals to electronics.

171
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.760
Electronics.

172
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.780
Okay, sounds good.

173
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.580
So you have to do this for each and every one.

174
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.110
Every.

175
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.840
You have to do this for all the subcategories we have over here.

176
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.130
Okay.

177
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.850
Okay.

178
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.270
And so whenever we choose men.

179
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.750
Man.

180
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.620
We basically want to update this variable.

181
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.380
We have a via or we basically want to add to this list.

182
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.330
So this list called a subcategory list.

183
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.180
You can see currently it is empty, right?

184
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:23.830
So when we choose whenever we choose men, when is equal to men, we want to set a state to change that

185
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.970
sub subcategory value to set right.

186
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:35.320
Also we want to update the subcategory list to say men to be the men category.

187
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.100
Right?

188
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.170
So fully understand this else if if it is equal to women, we basically want to do the same thing.

189
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.720
So you just have to do this for all the subcategories.
