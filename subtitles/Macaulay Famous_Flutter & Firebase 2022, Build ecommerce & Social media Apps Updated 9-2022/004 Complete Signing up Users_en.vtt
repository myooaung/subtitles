00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:01.920
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.360
Walker In last lecture, we created this class which we called out of control.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
Then within the class, we created a function which we called the of user.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.510
You can just call this set of users.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.980
Okay.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.820
Then over the side of users function, we passed all those fields.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.290
That's the whole name field, the user name field, the email field and the password field that also

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.040
we created a variable called address to store the possible error.

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.210
Okay.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
Then we also created a try and cache block in the try block.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.970
What we simply did was to create a check for all those fields.

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:47.310
That is, we said if all those fields are not empty, then only we want to create the user reads email

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.060
and password.

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.200
Then as well we stored the results in a variable called Create.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.480
Write that over here we are simply printing the user name, the user email to the keyboard console and

16
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.440
as well we are sending a specific message to that user.

17
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.010
Okay.

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.730
Now, we also said, what if all this feels empty?

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.340
Then we want to send a message to the user which says These fields must not be empty.

20
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
Then as well we have a catch block, if possible, orders.

21
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.420
For some reason this doesn't affect.

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.540
It's probably some other issues we want to catch.

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.590
That's arrows.

24
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.280
Then we also provide that to history.

25
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.850
Then as well we are in the rest variable.

26
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210
Okay, now it is lecture.

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.070
What they're going to do is they're going to use this function called inside of users.

28
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.470
Okay.

29
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.690
Now to do this, first of all, and what I use.

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.140
True.

31
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.580
And to make this wider.

32
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.740
Okay.

33
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.700
Now before we do anything else.

34
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.990
The first thing we're going to do is we are gonna initialize Firebase.

35
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.500
Okay.

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.590
We're going to go to middle.

37
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.270
That's fine.

38
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.200
Okay, now I'm going to use Control and B to make this wider.

39
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.560
Okay.

40
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.710
Now, over here.

41
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.680
What we can do for us is to pass the ACA, since we're going to be using the width.

42
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.310
Okay.

43
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.920
Now, what they're going to do is they're going to call the widget the flutter widget first before we

44
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.570
initialize our flutter.

45
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.630
So to do this, we can see before we initialize our five basic flutter.

46
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.060
Okay.

47
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.370
So we can set widgets.

48
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.850
We just.

49
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.160
Lotta find in.

50
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.950
The show, initialize up.

51
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.390
Okay.

52
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.930
Great.

53
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.400
Now, the next thing I want to do now we have just initialize the widgets.

54
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.310
So what I going to do?

55
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.020
This is our words.

56
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.950
There were no words for five days.

57
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.980
The governor said that.

58
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.470
So.

59
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.270
He's going to be fired.

60
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.500
Five days faster.

61
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.910
I think this is firebase does initialize app like grids.

62
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.510
It is control and save this.

63
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.340
Okay now the next thing you're going to do is we're going to go to our side of page.

64
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.570
So now I'm going to use control and B, so make this wider.

65
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.330
Then we're going to go to our screens, then our side of page.

66
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.320
Okay.

67
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.520
Now, whether he's going to try to make this wider.

68
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.780
Now, the first thing they are going to do is in order to have access to this imputes, that is their

69
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.440
value.

70
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.670
This is going to type in.

71
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.580
They're going to create a little test.

72
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.580
And it's in Portugal.

73
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.710
Okay.

74
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.170
Now they're going to go at the top of their.

75
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.240
So what we can do, we can create a.

76
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.890
Then there's going to be.

77
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.260
Cord on the score.

78
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.090
Full name.

79
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.870
Controller.

80
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.620
Okay, because I'm going to grab that hole and use is going to type these, right?

81
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.530
So this is going to be equal to test.

82
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.940
Says it did save controller.

83
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.430
Okay.

84
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.089
Now iswell, we can't give you type one most of the time because you can't avoid giving types.

85
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.290
So because it's a type of test, it is in controller.

86
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.370
Okay, great.

87
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.580
Now, I was going to do for the user the right.

88
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.790
Okay.

89
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.340
Is going to be fine as well.

90
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.040
First of all, you can just go ahead and give the type.

91
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.310
There's this on the score user name.

92
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.420
User name.

93
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.860
Crime thriller.

94
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.300
Right.

95
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.910
Is eager to test it.

96
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.420
Detain.

97
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.270
Controller.

98
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.870
So I believe you should have my studies a bit now so I can copy this.

99
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.520
Okay.

100
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.660
Right.

101
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.830
Then I'm going to paste this twice.

102
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.940
Like it is going to be.

103
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.900
Email.

104
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.840
Controller.

105
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.260
And this is going to be.

106
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.390
Password controller.

107
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.920
Now the next level, provide it to those fields we have.

108
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.880
Okay.

109
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.950
Now we're going to go first to the first field, which is the.

110
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.090
It's up for them.

111
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.790
They're going to say controller is going to be on this colorful.

112
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.310
Name.

113
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.330
Controller.

114
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.750
Okay.

115
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.560
I did try to cover it up with go to the second which the ETA username as well.

116
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.600
I want to say controller.

117
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.050
So.

118
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.440
Okay.

119
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.210
Control that is going to underscore the user name controller.

120
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.660
Okay.

121
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.520
Now I'm going to go to the.

122
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.590
In midfield.

123
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.040
So there's going to be control as well.

124
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.600
So bring us down the score.

125
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.390
E-mail controller.

126
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.020
Right.

127
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.470
Okay.

128
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.080
Then I'm going to go to the password.

129
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.050
So there's gonna be a controller as well.

130
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.320
So it's going to be underscore.

131
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.600
Password controller.

132
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.790
Okay, great.

133
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.430
Now, with this, we have.

134
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.610
Listed for the imputes of that user not to get the value.

135
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.430
Okay.

136
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.260
Now what they're going to do, they're going to go to the register button.

137
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.080
Okay.

138
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.370
This is the register button.

139
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.960
Right.

140
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.670
Now, what we can do is we can wrap this with a button because.

141
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.240
Clickable.

142
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.990
Okay.

143
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.430
So over this test, widgets, you can use control and dots.

144
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.560
Then you can wrap it with.

145
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.560
The equal.

146
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.360
Okay, we're which to get.

147
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.830
So there's going to be a big.

148
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.330
Well.

149
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.950
I think so.

150
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.920
I think in quote.

151
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.080
Okay.

152
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.630
Now we can have the on tap.

153
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.820
Okay.

154
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.570
You can create a functional way.

155
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.630
Now, what I'm going to say, first of all, the pasta async as well, since I'm going to be using with

156
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.180
that to wait for lab results.

157
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.690
Okay.

158
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.570
Now, what we can do is we can sit with.

159
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.330
Then they're going to have to have access to that site or sign up users.

160
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.920
Several of us have access to the arts, culture, the arts curricula.

161
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.820
That is a class.

162
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.990
They're going to see dots.

163
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.360
Okay.

164
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.560
So we need to call it illicit drugs.

165
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.570
Son of Jesus.

166
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.390
Okay, now for the full name.

167
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.440
This is going to be full name.

168
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.180
Comptroller Dodds says.

169
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.670
So with this we have the value in our hands.

170
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.830
So this is going to be using the for the school.

171
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.170
Username.

172
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.370
That's.

173
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.460
So he's under control controllers.

174
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.840
Okay.

175
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.820
There is going to be a test that this we need the value of what is is looked at and it's going to be

176
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.420
email.

177
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.270
Control the test.

178
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.500
Okay.

179
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.650
Therefore, the password is going to be on this code password.

180
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.630
Controller the test.

181
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.100
Okay, great.

182
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.270
Great.

183
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.620
Okay, great.

184
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.280
Now, what we can do is we start this.

185
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:42.919
Okay.

186
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.220
Okay.

187
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.660
Okay.

188
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:49.990
Okay.

189
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.890
Now I'm going to go to our sign off page.

190
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.310
Okay.

191
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.590
Okay.

192
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.280
What we're just going to do is open the book.

193
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.890
So.

194
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.120
You tell me now.

195
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.890
Okay.

196
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.350
Go, go, go, go.

197
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.620
Okay.

198
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.270
Debug.

199
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.210
Console.

200
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.060
Okay.

201
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.350
Okay.

202
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.680
Now the image has failed to load.

203
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.290
Okay.

204
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.020
Now, what you can do is.

205
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.220
You can.

206
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:27.610
Yes.

207
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.890
I think.

208
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.340
Okay.

209
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.460
For some reasons.

210
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.250
The keyboard arrow coming out okay is going to.

211
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.420
Okay.

212
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.150
So you can see Mark.

213
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.450
Can.

214
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.810
Okay.

215
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.090
System, are you going to click or wait?

216
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:06.840
Okay.

217
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.500
Mark, the user name is going to be Mark as well.

218
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.220
I think we're just going to squeeze that issue of image.

219
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.970
Okay, Elise.

220
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.840
And there's going to be like two male.

221
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.260
It's calm.

222
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.120
The password is going to be.

223
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.500
Why is he for now?

224
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.270
Okay.

225
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.340
Now I'm going to pick on the register.

226
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.800
Okay.

227
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.930
Great.

228
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.990
You just have to wait a while.

229
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.670
Ack ack ack ack ack ack.

230
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.140
Takes a while to come out of that issue because it goes, you see the call.

231
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.370
Okay, great.

232
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.780
Now you can see we have the lack of HTML this code.

233
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.680
Okay.

234
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.610
Great.

235
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.100
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
