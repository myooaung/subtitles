00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.350
In this lecture, residents are working on the product fields, and it's going to look just like this.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.110
Okay.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.970
Hi, guys.

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.660
Walker In this lecture, we are going to build the product a field script.

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.270
Okay, now, over this, we get our tree.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.470
We are going to create a new PHI and we are going to call this Phi Fields on this core product.

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.530
Then this section dot dot.

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.660
And now we can use Contra and V to make this right.

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.150
And then we can use this to to get you to see the reason for this in the future.

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.730
Videos.

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.890
Okay.

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.320
As well, we're going to call this Fields Products.

15
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.250
Okay?

16
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.950
And over here, we can then use control and dots in order to import the material that that package.

17
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.930
Now we already have the design for each single product right over here.

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.720
Okay.

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.460
So what we can then do.

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.800
We can go to this to the top that.

21
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.349
Oh, yeah.

22
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.150
We can copy everything.

23
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.590
We send the container.

24
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.920
To this last part.

25
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.770
You can see the reason you need to always have a comma.

26
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.480
Okay, copy.

27
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.340
Then we're going to go back to the field, spread out and control and B, that they're going to get

28
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.870
rid of this.

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.920
Right.

30
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.390
And then this.

31
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.010
Okay, great.

32
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.380
Now, definitely, we're going to get rid of errors.

33
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.690
What they're going to do first is they're going to get rid of this gesture detector.

34
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.670
Now, to do that, we do that.

35
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.200
We just have to do is to alight in this.

36
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.580
They use control and dots and you're going to see remove this widget.

37
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.080
Okay, great.

38
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.390
Now, in the future, our products are going to be coming from the flower bees.

39
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.670
Right?

40
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.800
So what you can just do is in the oven, this product, you control the model.

41
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.550
So we can just statically type this out.

42
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.460
So you are just going to statically hog the address.

43
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.820
So the image, one of the humans and what they use is they arrive at one of those pages, something

44
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.240
like that.

45
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.600
Okay.

46
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.360
So what can I do to add access to that image?

47
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.310
They're going to go to the assets.

48
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.100
Assets directory ten the image directory of the images that are over.

49
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.370
One.

50
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.520
Dot Angie.

51
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.400
Okay.

52
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.590
Now we'll click on this, okay.

53
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.820
For the product name.

54
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.970
You can just get rid of this for the now.

55
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.650
Decided to look at my day and we can see a of over.

56
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.280
Of our size.

57
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.590
Okay, great.

58
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.630
And for the price, we can as well get rid of this and.

59
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.620
As a cucumber, then you're going to see 8990.

60
00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.640
Now to use the dollar sign.

61
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.650
We can't use the dollar sign.

62
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.330
Now is going to see it as a variable.

63
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.280
Right.

64
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.420
So we're going to use the backslash over here.

65
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.090
That's the before the dollar sign.

66
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.350
Okay, great.

67
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.110
And now we can use control and save this file.

68
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.640
Now, the next thing we're going to do is contrary to this white.

69
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.510
Sorry, small.

70
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.300
Then I'm going to go to the fields screen.

71
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.670
Over a year.

72
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.580
And now we can use control and be like going to get rid of this center, which is.

73
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.740
Get rid of this center.

74
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.060
Okay.

75
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.450
Now we're going to use something which we have not seen before.

76
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.130
Now, what you're going to do is.

77
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.860
Okay.

78
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.200
Over these fields.

79
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:55.040
They're going to have the product of a year and in products of that is left to right, that is of horizontally,

80
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.380
right.

81
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.770
So you're going to have a product here, the products here, product here and the products here.

82
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.110
Okay.

83
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.270
Now, to do that, they're going to use something which I have not seen before, which is not as great

84
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.860
for you.

85
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.649
Dart counts now for the cross assist counts is asking how many products we need between each site that

86
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.570
is between the left and right.

87
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.930
So for now, we're just going to say not for the now, actually.

88
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.010
We're just going to say two are going to be needing to just two products between each site or to get

89
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.970
craziest to theory.

90
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.420
So you're going to have product here, product here, products here where this will go to.

91
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.830
So we have product at the left and at the right side.

92
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.330
Okay, great.

93
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.460
Now, the next thing you're going to do in this this this grid view has.

94
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.540
The children.

95
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.780
Now make sure you get rid of this over a.

96
00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.850
Then the case control initiative, and that's also the control necessary for us to get a good performance.

97
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.150
Okay.

98
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.040
And now we can have the children.

99
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.180
Okay.

100
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.980
And make sure you get rid of this.

101
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.420
Then we're gonna say list that generates.

102
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.040
Okay.

103
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.990
For the land is asking us how many products we need in the future.

104
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.130
The products this the product that is going to come from the flower.

105
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.860
So I go for the now statically type 50 that's based.

106
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.420
There's going to be 50 products in this field screen.

107
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.440
Okay.

108
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.910
Now is asking for how we're going to structure the product.

109
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.080
Right.

110
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.920
So we're going to return that single.

111
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.170
So the.

112
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.520
Fields.

113
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.880
Products like great.

114
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.310
Controller save and go check what you just did.

115
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.660
You can the seat of they now.

116
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.850
Okay.

117
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.950
Okay.

118
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.520
Great.

119
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.610
Now you can see now the necessary going to say is over.

120
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.930
Are you?

121
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.420
Okay.

122
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.600
It is going the hardest to cross us.

123
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.650
This place in the city to eight.

124
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.630
Okay.

125
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.910
I'll turn this to Steve.

126
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.320
Okay.

127
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.380
Now, the reason for this error is because the height is very small.

128
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.810
So you can't continue this.

129
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.930
Go see the size and the price.

130
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.980
Right.

131
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.210
So what you're going to do is.

132
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.950
Over here.

133
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.810
We're going to have something on this child aspect which you are able to divide.

134
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.460
The wheat and the high based on what we have here.

135
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.080
Okay.

136
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.040
In the.

137
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.550
The products.

138
00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:01.590
I think his products, you can see we have the wheat and the high quality in which the wheat is to order

139
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.870
it under heights is 180.

140
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.270
So you want to see so we can.

141
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:14.770
Say the weight is 200 divided by 11728.

142
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.090
Okay.

143
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.530
Okay.

144
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.790
Still very small.

145
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.190
What you can do, you can increase the height of air to to 80.

146
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.110
Okay.

147
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.790
You can see the heights is very long.

148
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.620
It's very much, yes, some extra space away.

149
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.470
I just know also it increases to to 40.

150
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:47.940
Okay.

151
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.570
Great.

152
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.960
It thinks it looked it think it looked good now.

153
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.850
Okay, now we can.

154
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.240
The black suits went to 20.

155
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.000
And see.

156
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.170
Okay.

157
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.460
I think this is better.
