00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.939
Worker In the last lecture, we postoperative data to a digital page.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.940
So now in this lecture, we are going to display the products.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.330
Okay.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.500
Not to do that, we are going to need to go to the detail page.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.860
Okay.

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.710
Over here.

8
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.330
Now, the first step we are going to need to take is we are going to be having access to this find by

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.770
Heidi.

10
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.700
Just went to the V.A. now not to have access to this find by the meter, you're going to need to have

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.030
access first to this class called for deaths.

12
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.820
Okay.

13
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.060
So not to do this, I'm gonna to go back to the Fields products.

14
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.060
Well Via.

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.410
And they're going to copy this culture and see.

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.260
Then they're going to go back to digital page.

17
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.180
And we're going to pick business within the widget booths.

18
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.230
So we have access to the contest now instead of products.

19
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.710
There's going to be products.

20
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.570
That is the.

21
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.990
Provide that class.

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.420
Okay.

23
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.580
And since that's where we have this function or the way it.

24
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.100
Okay, great.

25
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.250
So now we're going to go back to the detail page.

26
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.820
And this culture can be.

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.990
Now, the next step is to impart all this.

28
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.880
So you're going to need to highlight and use cultural dots.

29
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.860
Okay.

30
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.170
Imports, provider products.

31
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.530
Okay.

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.170
They probably need to imports provider.

33
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.540
Okay.

34
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.520
This.

35
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.910
Okay, now he's got you, and that's a safe.

36
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.660
Okay, now what you're going to need to do next is in the last picture, what we simply did was to pass

37
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.670
the product ID to this detail page by doing this.

38
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.190
Okay.

39
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.790
Now, what you're going to need to do now is you're going to agree to accept this product ID data.

40
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.150
Okay.

41
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.210
To do that, you're going to go back to the detail page and use control and be okay.

42
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.759
Now, first of all, what we can do is we can rename this to products data.

43
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.150
Okay.

44
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.580
Okay to do that over here.

45
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.400
We're going to create a finite variable and we're going to call this product ID.

46
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.370
It's going to be equal to.

47
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.390
Model.

48
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.200
Roots.

49
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.590
Okay.

50
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.430
Get rid of this dirt.

51
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.580
Of contests duds.

52
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.630
I think this never does.

53
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.950
Sets his standards.

54
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.230
Arguments.

55
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.470
Okay.

56
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.660
So now we have access to this.

57
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.590
We have access to this.

58
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.020
Product idea value.

59
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.940
Okay, great.

60
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.540
So I'm going to go back to digital.

61
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.490
Detail page.

62
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.030
Okay.

63
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.160
And we're going to provide this district by saying as.

64
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.620
As.

65
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.650
Strange.

66
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.140
Okay.

67
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.830
Over here at this.

68
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.870
Okay, great.

69
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.470
I just.

70
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.950
Gotcha.

71
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.780
And this is safe.

72
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.180
Okay.

73
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.680
Great.

74
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.250
Now, the next step we're going to need to take is we're going to create another find a.

75
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.460
Variable.

76
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.720
Okay.

77
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.640
Although I find that very well we can't call this products after birds we can just 80 arrow.

78
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.610
Right.

79
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.760
I can't think that should be.

80
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.390
Okay.

81
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.870
Sorry.

82
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.080
So we atc are okay.

83
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.080
Product attributes.

84
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.430
Okay.

85
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.970
It's going to be equal to.

86
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.170
The products deter variable looking products.

87
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.880
Data.

88
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.180
Great.

89
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.910
So now we have access to.

90
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.690
This method called Find by Heidi.

91
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.440
Okay, so all we just have to do now is to.

92
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.970
Say Dodd's.

93
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.080
Fine.

94
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.610
Right, Heidi.

95
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.000
Okay.

96
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.120
Now you can see it automatically pass the I.D., your product I.D. You can see that was the reason we

97
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.090
have to create a dynamic variable called product ID.

98
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.560
Okay, great.

99
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.960
That was that's.

100
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.810
So nice country and that's first of all on your record in this country and that's to save.

101
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.670
Okay.

102
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.390
Now we're going to go to the image.

103
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.810
Okay.

104
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.860
This is your dollar sign.

105
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.690
You're going to need to see products at attributes, dots.

106
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.640
Images.

107
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.750
Okay.

108
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.260
Great.

109
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.940
Now is culture and save and go check it out.

110
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.920
Now we have not done for this what we have did for this.

111
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.180
Okay.

112
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.990
Now click on this.

113
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.460
Okay, great.

114
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.840
You can see.

115
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.000
Okay.

116
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.600
Great.

117
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.800
Right.

118
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.620
If you do understand, you can do well to contact me.

119
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.220
So I try to explain for that for you.

120
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.590
Okay.

121
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.000
Hopefully you're not going to get everything right, but you're going to get it as the time goes like

122
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.360
it is for the image you're going to find for the.

123
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.120
Okay for the title.

124
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.270
I think this is going to be for the title is going to be this this.

125
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.880
Dollar is going to be products attributes.

126
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.450
That's.

127
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.930
So to use culture in this.

128
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.180
Okay.

129
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.690
Great.

130
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.500
Okay.

131
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.850
This is basically all we have.

132
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.130
In the future, we're gonna have.

133
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.690
They're going to have the prize and the description.

134
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.420
And I already had two cards.

135
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.320
What's it like?

136
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.880
So this is basically.

137
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.450
It's right.

138
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.180
They're just going to go to this.

139
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.930
Okay.

140
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.600
You can see.

141
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.670
So it's good.

142
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.110
Now, if you do understand, do go to let me know.

143
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.260
So I split for two for you.

144
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.660
Okay.

145
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.660
Okay, guys, see you in investiture.
