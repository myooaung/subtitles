00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.690
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.300
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.070
Now, in the last lecture asks you to clear these values.

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.830
The user clicks on log in.

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.860
Okay, so now this lecture, we're going to do it together.

6
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.400
Okay.

7
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.610
Now to do this, they're just going to go to the log in button.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.510
Okay.

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.650
I think should be above.

10
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.170
Okay.

11
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.520
Now, this is our fruit song.

12
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.960
Adjust this log in, use a server there, accommodates more.

13
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.640
I know that was stuck with it more.

14
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.740
I will use a function.

15
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.910
So this is going to be this the lockdown function.

16
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.810
Okay.

17
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.190
Now, first of all, going to call the log in users.

18
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.090
Right.

19
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.680
You can't just had this.

20
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.770
Do it then coma then as well.

21
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.940
I got to clear the fields.

22
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.650
Okay, to clear the fields.

23
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.890
We're going to call our Cuadrilla Sue.

24
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.140
I think we need this.

25
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.740
Not comma.

26
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.190
Sorry.

27
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.120
Okay.

28
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.230
Now, don't sit on this call email.

29
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.700
Controller Dot.

30
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.170
What's that?

31
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.120
Right.

32
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.100
And on the score.

33
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.330
Password.

34
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.510
Controller.

35
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.210
But what?

36
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.230
Claire.

37
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.360
Okay, great.

38
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.630
Now, with these control ideas to save.

39
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.660
Okay.

40
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.850
Then I'll just write out.

41
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.940
Okay.

42
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.770
Now I may look on this can see now and that's all era as a card because I don't have my wife.

43
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.920
It's not okay.

44
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.770
But this is what we basically wanted to do to clear the fields.

45
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.180
Okay.

46
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.540
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
