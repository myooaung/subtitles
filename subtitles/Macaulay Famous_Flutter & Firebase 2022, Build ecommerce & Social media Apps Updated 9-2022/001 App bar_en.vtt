00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.860
Hi.

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.960
Welcome.

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.730
In this lecture, we are going to start building the profile screen.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.260
Okay.

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:20.690
Now, in the last lecture, what we simply did is whenever a user searched for other user, then they

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.920
should be able to click on this to take the user to the search user profile screen.

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.400
So in this lecture, we are going to start building the profile screen for the user.

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.980
Okay.

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.520
And over here you can see we still have that profile page test.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.380
Now what we can do is we can head up to the coast, the Dot Phi, and we have to get rid of this and

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.440
use the profile to use the profile screen, profile screen.

12
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.790
Profile screen and what you have to do is to halt.

13
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.780
We started.

14
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.420
It's going to take some time to restart and definitely.

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.920
Okay.

16
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.060
All three started.

17
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.460
And back to this.

18
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.880
Okay.

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.570
It's hurt to restart this now, and we just have to wait.

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.190
Okay.

21
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.270
This OC profile screen.

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.440
And now we can then start building the profile screen.

23
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.290
Well before then, like I said, when the user search for other users over here.

24
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.670
Right.

25
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.410
And they click on this.

26
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.040
We want to be able to display the user profile screen profile details over here.

27
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.690
To do that, we have to pass the UID of the user.

28
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.320
So we have to go to the screen and.

29
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.180
You can see why we have the navigator.

30
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.000
Sorry.

31
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.680
Over here.

32
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.910
We wrapped the list.

33
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.300
View the beta with a gesture detector.

34
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.430
And over here we created a function called on tap.

35
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.070
And over here we are saying navigator dot push, dot off, contest material, page out.

36
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.460
And we basically want to go to the profile screen.

37
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.530
And what we then have to do is in the profile screen.

38
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.110
We can just create a final Rainbow Warrior, and we're going to call this Foreigner Rainbow.

39
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.150
Okay.

40
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.540
Maybe string and uid uid.

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.520
And now we have to pass it on to the constructor alight and then create constructor for final fields

42
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.270
and you can see it automatically passed the required keyword.

43
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.770
And over here in the search screen where we are calling the profile screen, you can see it's asking

44
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.290
for the value and for the value.

45
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.310
We are going to use this search data and of course you can see we have the profile screen above this

46
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.210
search data.

47
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.700
So we can't use this variable because it is below the profile screen.

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.180
Right.

49
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.970
It's going to say maybe on the fine because we have the variable value and we are trying to use it to

50
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.330
buy it.

51
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.930
Right.

52
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.680
So what we then have to do is to alight and use control and then we are going to remove this widget

53
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.370
and we are going to then wrap this list view.

54
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.510
So at least tie a light and use controlling dot and okay.

55
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.470
Ah sorry wrap with widget.

56
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.730
And we are then going to wrap this with a gesture detector.

57
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.330
And as you know, the gesture detector has a property known as on tap.

58
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.540
And we can then say the navigator.

59
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.660
Nah.

60
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.850
The gator dodged the tough contest and dot push.

61
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.760
We basically want to push to the profile screen.

62
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.620
Material.

63
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.350
Peter out.

64
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.150
I think you've seen all this before.

65
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
Material Peter out and it's going to take in the context.

66
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.950
And of course, we can choose to specify the type of context that it is, a type of beauty contest.

67
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.440
But most of the time you really do not need to specify, okay, and this.

68
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.890
And now we have to return the profile.

69
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.000
The Pro Fei.

70
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.870
Profile screen.

71
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.390
Okay profile screen and you can see he's asking for the UID, right?

72
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:46.790
Because over here in the profile screen, in the profile screen, we created a variable called UID and

73
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.600
whenever we call this a profile screen is going to require the value of the kid.

74
00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.010
So y you can see it's asking us to assign a value to that uid and for the value is going to be the search

75
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.580
data.

76
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.100
Variable search data.

77
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.200
Search data and dots uid how this and had this.

78
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.810
So over in the OC seems good.

79
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.330
And also you can see we are also calling the profile screen in the cost of PHI.

80
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:33.630
So we also do need to provide the we also need to provide provide the value to the uid sorry oc uid

81
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.870
and for the UID is going to be that old controller.

82
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.880
You can just see odd controller.

83
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.690
I think we have it globally and lot user.

84
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.610
Though it's uid and why we need a no check.

85
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.050
Okay, Cisco.

86
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.140
Sounds good, right?

87
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.770
Okay.

88
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.520
And now we can then start using the profile screen.

89
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.110
So what we can just do is we can get rid of this body over here.

90
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.810
It's NCA, right?

91
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.630
And within the scaffold, we can then have a higher bar.

92
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.760
And this is going to be high bar.

93
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.810
Bar.

94
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.370
Okay.

95
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.450
We can give a color to the sidebar.

96
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.070
Sorry, a background color.

97
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.190
And maybe this is going to be close to black.

98
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.780
Black 12 and also within the harbor.

99
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.200
We can then have survey within the harbor.

100
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:34.580
The harbor has a property known as leading and it's going to be an icon.

101
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.370
Widget icon.

102
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.980
Icon.

103
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.400
And what we can just say is icons.

104
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.130
Sorry.

105
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.730
Icons.

106
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.460
Dot.

107
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.960
Person.

108
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.580
I think we have person.

109
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.950
On this score hard.

110
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.030
Okay.

111
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.250
You can just go with this.

112
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.140
Okay.

113
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.630
Use control and save and go check it out.

114
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.550
Okay.

115
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.280
We just have to.

116
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.900
We start this again.

117
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.220
Sorry for the delay.

118
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.290
I think I talk way too much.

119
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.020
Okay.

120
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.610
And go check it out.

121
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.410
It's going to hold as we start this now and we are then good to go.

122
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.490
And you can see the view and also see heart icon over here.

123
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.690
The harbor has a property known as action.

124
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.940
But you could just use a row for this.

125
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.240
Right.

126
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.530
And use space between right to have an icon or via an icon over here as well.

127
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.270
But the harbor has a property known as action.

128
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:48.500
Action.

129
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.190
Sorry.

130
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:56.040
Within the harbour actions and we can then use maybe.

131
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.030
Icon.

132
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.590
Then this is going to be icons dot.

133
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.200
More.

134
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.580
I think we have something like that.

135
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.330
More.

136
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.540
On the score.

137
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.790
Horace.

138
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.600
Okay.

139
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.190
Okay.

140
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.730
He's safe.

141
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.770
And you're going to see it over here.

142
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.560
And like I said, you could just use a row for this.

143
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.450
Okay.

144
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.430
And now the.

145
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.440
The harbor has also a property known as tied to.

146
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.940
Tied to.

147
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.350
So where are we?

148
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.480
We tend to harbour.

149
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.900
Well, okay.

150
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.860
Sorry, Ty, too.

151
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.140
And it's going to be a test with and we can just say this is going to be for the username.

152
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.060
Like in the future, we are going to be able to retrieve the user name, right?

153
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:04.590
For now we can just go with this test and we can then have a star and test the star.

154
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.620
Of course.

155
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.600
To stay.

156
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.360
To start, we can increase the foreign trade.

157
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.210
So maybe to eat.

158
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.290
The bored and ideal newcomer.

159
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.830
And this control necessary.

160
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.870
And go check it out.

161
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.720
Okay.

162
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.690
We could also take it to the centre within the harbour.

163
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:40.210
It has a property known as center title and we can then set it to true.

164
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.490
Okay.

165
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.960
You can try and save.

166
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:46.800
Okay.

167
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.070
Sims.

168
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.460
Cool.

169
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.980
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
