00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.120
In the last lecture, we created this class called Arts Culture.

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.780
And the first thing we did was to initialize the five base arts.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.270
And over here, we created a function.

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.900
And over here, we simply said we want to be able to sign in user using the Google sign in method.

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.290
Okay.

8
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.370
Now, over here, we are not going to have access to the user details.

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.970
Okay.

10
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.700
So what we simply did, first of all, was to check if the user is either logged in or not.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.870
And over here we are having access to the user details.

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.500
And over here we are totally storing the data in the firebase parts.

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.520
Okay.

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.120
So now what we can do is we can then call this function.

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.510
Okay.

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.470
Then it that's a call.

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.800
This function that is assigned and with Google will first need to have access to this odd controller

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.250
class.

19
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.640
Okay.

20
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.820
So now to do this, we are going to need to go to the login screen.

21
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.120
And the first thing to do is to initialize that class.

22
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.940
So over here we can create a variable and we can just go ahead and specify.

23
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.830
It is a type of controller and we can call this rainbow, underscore, underscore or controller.

24
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.610
Now the reason for this underscore is because we want this variable to be only accessible within this

25
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.000
file.

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.660
Okay.

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.520
So now we can say is equal to the hot controller.

28
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.460
Oh, it's quite a class.

29
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.050
Okay, now over here, we can then get rid of this, and we can then say on the school board, control

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.260
our start signing with Google.

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.710
Okay.

32
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.620
Now warned us that we need to take this away.

33
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.560
We're going to need to check this.

34
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.380
So whenever we get an error, it's never across our hop, but it just goes to show that error to the

35
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.540
debug console.

36
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.140
So make sure you uncheck this.

37
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.500
Okay.

38
00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.330
And one more thing I need to do is to tell a filter that we want to initialize Firebase, or we want

39
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.600
to start using Firebase.

40
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.010
Okay.

41
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.750
So over here, we can, first of all, initialize all our widgets.

42
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.220
So you can set widgets.

43
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.770
Widgets.

44
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.590
Widgets flutter Biden.

45
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.490
Towards a sure.

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.650
Sure.

47
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.660
And sure initialize I'm is going to do this for a prediction.

48
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.640
I can't for the sake.

49
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.020
Okay.

50
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.200
Widgets.

51
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.790
FLATOW By the Dutch insurer.

52
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.310
Let's say we have the show.

53
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.970
And.

54
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.070
A conspiracy.

55
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.550
Sure.

56
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.380
Okay.

57
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.970
That's.

58
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.560
Insurance sales are up, so.

59
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.690
Okay.

60
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.150
We only need to call it.

61
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.560
Okay.

62
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.120
This is going to take some time.

63
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.040
We need to think.

64
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.670
Okay.

65
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.790
And over here, you're going to see our weights.

66
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.770
And now we can initialize firebase.

67
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.180
So firebase.

68
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.540
Dot what is sure.

69
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.590
Initialize.

70
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.460
Okay.

71
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.570
So we're simply saying is we want to call our widget first and then we want to tell flowchart that we

72
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.520
want to start using the firebase.

73
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.450
It's going to take some time.

74
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.220
So we are waiting for it.

75
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.640
Okay.

76
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.790
And now we can we start this?

77
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.190
Okay.

78
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.720
Okay.

79
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.130
Okay.

80
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.610
Okay.

81
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.060
Okay.

82
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.510
Okay.

83
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.960
Okay.

84
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.440
Okay.

85
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.890
Okay.

86
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.370
Okay.

87
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.880
Okay.

88
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.630
Okay.

89
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.310
Okay.

90
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.840
Okay.

91
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.180
And now we can try.

92
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.440
Okay.

93
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.130
I've done this before to test the kids.

94
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.990
Are you saying this is going to go back?

95
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.290
Okay.

96
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.560
Okay.

97
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.230
And.

98
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.250
Or to start.

99
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.250
Okay.

100
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.210
Okay.

101
00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.600
Okay.

102
00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.960
Okay.

103
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.290
Okay.

104
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.740
Okay.

105
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.940
Okay.

106
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.450
Okay.

107
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.960
Okay.

108
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.470
Okay.

109
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.980
Okay.

110
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.460
Okay.

111
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.390
Okay, okay.

112
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.810
Okay.

113
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.310
So now you can try.

114
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.720
You can then click now make sure you are using the API so it's not as I think you might get an error

115
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.670
because I was using the techy and I had some errors so you can click on this.

116
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.650
Okay.

117
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.180
Now we can check our seminar to make sure we don't have any error.

118
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.470
Okay.

119
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.770
You can see we don't.

120
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.800
Okay.

121
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.990
We dance over here, you can see.

122
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.010
Okay.

123
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.540
You can see it is loaded.

124
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.960
Okay.

125
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.220
Okay.

126
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.050
Or you can just do is enter your your details.

127
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.440
Then after that, you're going to check here and you're going to see this.

128
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.790
Okay.

129
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.100
Look, I'm not going to go through this because of time, and you can just do that yourself.

130
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.420
Hopefully it works with that error.

131
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.780
So after that, you're going to see the user over here.

132
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.640
You can easily just refresh in case or reload in case you did not see it.

133
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.060
Okay.

134
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.100
Okay, guys, see you.

135
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.790
And then switch.
