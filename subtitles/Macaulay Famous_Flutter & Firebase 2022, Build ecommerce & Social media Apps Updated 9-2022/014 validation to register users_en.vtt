00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.110
Now, the last lecture we created is class with your code controller, and we are extended from the

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.100
guidance controller.

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.070
And the reason for this get this controller or so get this is going to have control over the UI.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.650
Then over the remainder, that's fine.

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.660
What we simply did was to first of all initialize firebase like startle the with entry before our hub

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
gets runs but before we get using our have it over.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.110
Yeah we said get the thoughts that we passed in that order controller which we had and the are created

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.330
the reason for this is so we have access to this controller within our routes, all pages.

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.370
Okay then is that you're also going to do now are going to create the validation for creating user.

12
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
So what you can do that can have a comment over here so I can just see registering.

13
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.580
User.

14
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.640
Probably my Spanish look, I'm just going to leave it that way.

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.170
Okay.

16
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.050
So now.

17
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.140
We have I think we have the image field.

18
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.110
We have the user name said.

19
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.040
We have the email field.

20
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.100
We have the password field.

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.430
Right.

22
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.590
So now what you can do, we can create a function that does not send.

23
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.530
You can save void.

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.610
You can call this function register.

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.800
User.

26
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.090
Okay.

27
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.150
Great.

28
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.540
So now what I'm going to do.

29
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.780
I'm going to pass in those.

30
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.780
They were going to had validation.

31
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.810
So now the first field we need is the.

32
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.830
User name rights.

33
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.590
It's going to be a data type of strength.

34
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.590
This is a test.

35
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.300
Okay.

36
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.750
Great.

37
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.880
So we needed to.

38
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
I think we need the email.

39
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.140
It's also going to be a type of data type of stranger.

40
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.880
That sense is going to be it says as well.

41
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.970
Okay.

42
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.270
We also need to.

43
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.960
Password, right?

44
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.880
So password as well is a test.

45
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.380
So there's going to be a data type of string.

46
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.550
Then lastly, we need the image.

47
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.170
Okay.

48
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.540
So it is going to be a type of FY.

49
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.450
Okay.

50
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.160
We're just gonna on dirt.

51
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.730
Okay.

52
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.480
Make sure you don't import the dot dot Easter mail, but the dot dot Oreo package.

53
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.840
Okay.

54
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.040
Now this kind of thing also had this was I.

55
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.000
Okay, now we are going to create the validation.

56
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.670
So what you are going to do, we are going to say try.

57
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.880
Is to try and catch so you can just stay for that.

58
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.140
You can just navigate to this spot.

59
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.280
So now for us to automatically use the try and catch.

60
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.980
Okay, now for the try.

61
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.710
What you can do over here.

62
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.190
I'm going to use an E statements.

63
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.750
We can see if.

64
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.090
The user name that is not empty and.

65
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.130
Sorry.

66
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.610
And the email.

67
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.840
That is not empty.

68
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.610
Okay.

69
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.850
And the.

70
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.950
Password.

71
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.020
And the password.

72
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.190
The church is not empty.

73
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.350
Then we also going to see and.

74
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.460
Image.

75
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.270
Is not.

76
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.140
So this race is not equal to no.

77
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.740
Okay.

78
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.700
Good.

79
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:26.900
So now if it is not equal to non what we want to do, we can just decorate the way we do.

80
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.960
We can say we we want to save the user.

81
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.620
So.

82
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.700
So, Art.

83
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.510
And Flyaways and.

84
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.490
To fire up his fire start.

85
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.440
Okay, great.

86
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.450
Now, if we.

87
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.440
Have an error of their.

88
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.920
We are just going to see which one is not.

89
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.230
So I'm going to say get.

90
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.780
Okay.

91
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.340
So what I can do.

92
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.560
What we can do.

93
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.560
So we are put in together that is going to remove.

94
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.910
This was a.

95
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.930
He's going to be.

96
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.070
Get that?

97
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.570
So get that.

98
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.080
Okay, great.

99
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:35.280
I can see we have access to write down imports in individual individual stuff from the get.

100
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.960
Okay.

101
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.150
So we're going to get that.

102
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.800
Get a snack bar.

103
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.130
Now we need to pass in the title of the hero or the hero title.

104
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.470
So I'm going to say hero.

105
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.330
Creating.

106
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.610
Accounts.

Okay.

108
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.030
So now for the.

109
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.170
For the.

110
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.140
Here.

111
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.450
They're just going to eat it and convert it to it.

112
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.860
So I say either to think, okay, great.

113
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.860
Okay.

114
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.710

Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
