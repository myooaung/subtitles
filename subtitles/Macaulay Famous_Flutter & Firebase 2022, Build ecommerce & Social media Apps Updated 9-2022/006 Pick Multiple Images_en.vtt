00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.609
Wassup guys?

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.510
In this lecture we are going to be able to pick multiple images from our gallery and we are going to

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.900
be using a much more cleaner way to do this.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
Now the first step is to create the function, and I'm going to say void.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.880
And the name of the function is going to be pink.

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.970
Products, images like and within the function, we can then use a try and a cash block in case there

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.260
is any error.

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:43.220
And over within the try we can then create a variable to store the images so we can then say finer and

9
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.320
we can call this picked.

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.600
Peaks images.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.280
Okay.

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.010
And now we need access to the image picker package in order to pick multiple images to do this.

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.230
What we can do is over here, we can just go ahead and specify the type of label it is, the type of

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.920
finder, and it is a type of image picker.

15
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.240
And we can call this variable on the peak image.

16
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.520
Sorry, underscore on the scope picker and it's going to be equal to the image picker.

17
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.840
Image picker package.

18
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.470
Okay.

19
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
And now over here we can use this variable underscore picker.

20
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.500
This picture.

21
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.380
Then dots peek multiple image.

22
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.350
You can see how powerful the image picker is.

23
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.840
And now we do not really need to specify the source and how we are going to pick that images.

24
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.780
Because defaults, we are only going to be able to pick images from the gallery.

25
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.560
Of course, we can't speak multiple images from the camera.

26
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.150
Right.

27
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.540
But what we can do is the peak image sorry.

28
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.250
The peak multiple image has a property like mass sides.

29
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.229
So you can give a mass height of 300 for the image and also it has a property like mass width.

30
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:19.130
We could also say 300 and it also has a property like image quality and we can say we need a better

31
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.880
quality.

32
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.740
Okay.

33
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.810
Had your semi-colon and of course, it's going to take some time to open the gallery.

34
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.830
So what we can do, we can tell Flutter that we are ready to wait for this.

35
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.320
To do that, we have to use the async over here in order to be able to use the weights.

36
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.340
Okay.

37
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.150
Sounds good.

38
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.160
And now we can then create a global variable to store the pict images.

39
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.690
Right.

40
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.540
So over here you can see we are going to be able to pick multiple images, right?

41
00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.310
So this is going to be within a list so we can create a list and it's going to be a type of this wish

42
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.230
of nothing before se fi.

43
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.260
And we can't say it can be, nor imagine if the user goes to the gallery and refuses to pick an image.

44
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.530
Right.

45
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.910
So it can be no.

46
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.420
And we can call this label image list.

47
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.030
And instead of using the leads, what we could also do, we could use the empty list over here if it

48
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.030
was a string.

49
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.000
What you can do to avoid the list as it is a string.

50
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.290
What you could do is to use an empty code so via ACC or you can just use delete.

51
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.200
It's the same.

52
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.960
Okay.

53
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.700
So this is good and over.

54
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.980
Yet we can set state.

55
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.440
Said States.

56
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.170
And we can then call the global variable we just created.

57
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.290
Image lists is going to be equal to the.

58
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.250
The variable called peaked.

59
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.980
Peaked.

60
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.380
Images and yeah, we can just had a no check over grits.

61
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.780
Sounds good.

62
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.940
And this is how basically, Nate, I think this is more easy.

63
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.040
You can just start using this step.

64
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.089
I know there are a lot of ways to achieve the same results and floater.

65
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.690
So you can just start using this step.

66
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.370
Then maybe instead of picking image, multiple image, you could also say pick.

67
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.280
That's what.

68
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.500
That's peak image, then you have to specify the image source.

69
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.320
Still to be similar, you can just go around with the one you think is more convenient for you.

70
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.840
Okay?

71
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.580
And now what we have to do is to display the images, right?

72
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.180
To do that over here, we have this test.

73
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.610
So once we can say, we can then say underscore, sorry, not underscore.

74
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.580
We did not make that for a variable private.

75
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.040
So we can say image.

76
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.100
This is not equal to nor.

77
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.920
If it is not equal to null, then.

78
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.940
It is not equal to nursery.

79
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.680
Then what we want to do is we want to be able to display the image.

80
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.930
And since it is a list of images, we need to display them in a list view to be that right.

81
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.650
So what we can do in order to make our code more cleaner, we can just create a functional wire which

82
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.450
is going to say display images.

83
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.480
And else if it is empty, we then want to display the test.

84
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.090
So over here we have to create it at the top.

85
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.640
Or anywhere you saw desire.

86
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.560
And I'm just going to create this via.

87
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.420
But before then after.

88
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.750
But we have to specify what we are going to be expecting.

89
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.760
So it is a type of widgets because the list view that beta is a widget, right?

90
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.290
And we need this.

91
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.950
And over here, we're going to return this view.

92
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.980
These view.

93
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.310
Your view there.

94
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.060
And of course, the least viewed of either has a property search like contest and the index, which

95
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.660
is going to be referring to how many images we picked.

96
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.800
Okay.

97
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.690
And this and now what we have to say is.

98
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.740
Yeah.

99
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.670
Over a year.

100
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.120
We are going to return.

101
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.980
Image Dodd's Fire.

102
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.510
You can see we have assets which has to do with images from our files.

103
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.490
We also have the image memory, which has to do with the U.

104
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.510
S at least, which I showed you when we picked image from our gallery when we are creating an account

105
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.020
here.

106
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.070
We also have the network, but we are going to go with the file.

107
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.640
Okay, Fi.

108
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.170
And now what we have to do is fi again.

109
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.730
And we need to import it.

110
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.540
A light.

111
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.840
A light and use control and dots we are going to import from dot io.

112
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.770
Please do not import from that HTML as you're going to get an error which is going to crash your hub.

113
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.500
So we are important from that.

114
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:35.400
That's how and why we have to call the image list variable.

115
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.620
And over here we need to pass the index in order to assess each images.

116
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.470
And now we have to say dot parts.

117
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.710
And over here we also do need a no check.

118
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.560
And over here we need a semicolon.

119
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.130
Okay.

120
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.590
And the last thing we have to do is to specify.

121
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.280
The item counts, which has to do with the Twitter image.

122
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.530
And this is going to be image at least ten dots length.

123
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.940
And over here we need a no check, all three studies.

124
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.320
And that is how.

125
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.710
I think this is a bit more easier.

126
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.200
Like I said, there are a lot of ways to achieve the same results in Flutter.

127
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:26.800
You can just use different way, but it's still going to be the same results you will definitely get.

128
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.520
Okay.

129
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.280
And.

130
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.440
Applaud.

131
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.600
Sorry.

132
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.440
Lastly, we have to call this function called peak product images.

133
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.960
We have to call that.

134
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.400
And we have the function.

135
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.210
Over.

136
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.830
Over a.

137
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.670
So we have to say peak.

138
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.910
Peak image, peak product image and use controller.

139
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.440
And that's the save.

140
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.510
And now we can.

141
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.060
Try this.

142
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.570
And click on this.

143
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:16.050
You can see and what we have to do is to, I think, live, click, audio, live click and so your left

144
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:21.750
click and now you can pick that is you have to click pin down to your left click.

145
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:27.030
So you can see we are able to pick multiple images and now select.

146
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.310
Or you can just add some more.

147
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:35.390
If you do not have to do that, you can basically just go to where you have your images and drag.

148
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.180
Drag and alternate and open your this.

149
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.320
You can see I have a lot of stuff open there and piss it away.

150
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.600
So that's all you can see.

151
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.820
Those are two hard images to your letter and I click on that.

152
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.660
Okay.

153
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.670
You can see we have this same skirt.

154
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.560
Default is going to take the least bit of beta.

155
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.440
It's going to take the vertical shape.

156
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.750
But we could also say maybe within the list view that you are.

157
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.580
Please view that view there.

158
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:20.470
We could also set scroll direction to say assess, assist, thoughts, or visitor to have the horizontal

159
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.330
shape that is from left to right.

160
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.640
You can see now some good.

161
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.150
You just have to follow anyone you think is okay.

162
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.920
Okay, guys.

163
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.550
See you.

164
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.120
And then let's.
