1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.640
After Azer placed an order, we are going to clear the product from the user cards and also we are going

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.490
to take the user back to the customer on screen.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.030
To do this, you can see over here we basically have a material button and we send the material, but

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.460
then we have the press function.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.350
And first of all, what we have to do is to look over each item or each product we have in our cards.

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.650
And over here we created a variable called Order F, and it is a type of something known as collection

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.700
referrals.

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.980
And what we are simply saying is it's going to be equal to underscore faster.

9
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.060
That's collection.

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.350
And we want to create a new collection called Orders.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.270
And also over here we have the order ref and the dog in that store.

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.540
Each order in this order collection.

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.530
And also what we have to do is to create a unique ID for each order.

14
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.099
Right.

15
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:11.970
And you can see over here we used a late keyword and we said it is a type of string.

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.260
And the reason for this limit is because currently we are basically not assigning it to any value at

17
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.250
this point.

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.240
Right.

19
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.590
And you can see why a.

20
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.590
We are then assigning to assigning it to a value and it is equal to something known as EU ID v4.

21
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.960
What does we basically do to help us generate a unique ID for each of our products?

22
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.810
You can see over here we are passing the.

23
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.310
Voter ID and basically we are passing all the fields we need for that order, or we are passing all

24
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.070
the fields we need for that document.

25
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.720
Okay, great.

26
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.550
And now what we can then do is over here right before the semicolon, we can then say that when completes

27
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.919
that when completes, that is, after all this has been successfully stored in our cloud faster database,

28
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.590
then we are going to call the contest contest.

29
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.400
Contest doth read.

30
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.650
And we have to specify the provider we want to have access to.

31
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.420
We want to have access to the card provider class.

32
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.480
And you can see via within the card provider.

33
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.280
COTS provider.

34
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.280
We have a function called clear cut.

35
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.290
You can see and basically we are calling the on the score list and we are saying that Clay.

36
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.650
Okay.

37
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.270
So we have to then call that.

38
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.970
I'm trying to be and just click, click.

39
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.870
Okay.

40
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.900
And lastly, what we have to do is to use the navigator, navigator the off compass, then the push.

41
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760
But this is going to be navigator.

42
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.800
Navigator.

43
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.420
Navigator dot of contest.

44
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.630
Dodd's push.

45
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.150
Push name and remove on seal.

46
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.840
Right.

47
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:29.100
We are basically not using the navigator to push because default is going to have a back error.

48
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.250
So when we go to the home page, back to the home page, there's going to be an arrow via again to go

49
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.520
back.

50
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.760
So what we are basically saying, once we go to that new route, we do not want to be able to come back

51
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.140
to the screen again.

52
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.300
Okay.

53
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.640
Okay.

54
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.800
And for the new routes, it's going to be the.

55
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.300
Customer.

56
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.890
Customers on screen that read name OC.

57
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.500
This is basically it.

58
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.610
And I think we need this.

59
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.690
And you can see we are setting the current rules to force.

60
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.820
That is, we don't want to be able to go back.

61
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.300
And since we are not able to go back, there will be no hirer.

62
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.100
Or you can just use the navigator that pushed and off contest without this push name and remove those.

63
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.640
So to see what I'm trying to explain, I think you've seen that before.

64
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.040
Okay.

65
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.900
So what we can then do is use control and save.

66
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.990
And currently I think we have two products.

67
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.360
Okay.

68
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.890
So.

69
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.020
I think we have to product also what we can just do is we can change the the color.

70
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.590
The icon themed colour.

71
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.840
We tend to harbor.

72
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.650
We can then have the icon team.

73
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.100
This is going to be icon theme.

74
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.400
Data and you can set the color to colors.

75
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.110
US the black.

76
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.990
That Black Oak.

77
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.560
This country needs to save.

78
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.140
And also we need to do that for the place of the screen, because basically we copy the code from this.

79
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.730
Icon team.

80
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.120
Icon team data.

81
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.600
And we can change the color to call us black.

82
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.900
Okay.

83
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.480
And this should be black now.

84
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.640
Okay.

85
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.690
Okay.

86
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.970
So let's go and click on Confirm.

87
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.100
Again Black as well.

88
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.960
And we want to go for the catch on delivery and click on Confirmed and Pay.

89
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.910
Okay.

90
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.970
Okay.

91
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.720
Sounds good.

92
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.300
Took us back to you can see there is no error.

93
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.640
Now try to see if you can use the navigator navigator dot push and you're going to see an arrow via

94
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.230
because default is going to have that arrow in.

95
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.270
That's to go back to that previous round or that previous screen.

96
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.070
So what this will basically do this navigator.

97
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.330
Now we get our push on to remove or this is going to get rid of that previous route.

98
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.970
You can see we are setting the previous routes before us.

99
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.180
Okay.

100
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.900
Sounds good.

101
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.830
And you can see currently we have no items on our cards because we basically called this click cut to

102
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.840
clear it after finishing uploading it.

103
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.370
Okay.

104
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.540
Hopefully you understand this, but if you don't, you can do what to let me know.

105
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.180
Okay, guys.
