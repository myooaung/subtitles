00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.450
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.930
In this lecture.

4
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:11.760
What we are going to do is when we click on this, we won't be able to update this image to this.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.180
And when we click on this, we want to be able to update this image to this.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.750
Okay, to do this, we are going to create something known as page controller within the state.

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.780
We are going to create a finer and we can just go ahead and specify the type of variable it is, a type

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.850
of page controller and we can call this rainbow on the score page controller and it's going to be equal

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.280
to page controller.

10
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.660
Okay.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.560
Now the next step is to bind this variable called underscore page controller to the page view.

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.140
Okay?

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.290
To do that, the page view has a property known as controller, and this is going to be equal to the

14
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.980
page.

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.360
View.

16
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.940
Sorry, the page controller variable grid.

17
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.850
And now what we then have to do is to make those images clickable.

18
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.840
To do that, we have to wrap this image with a button and wrap with with that, we're going to wrap

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.780
this with a gesture detector type.

20
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.940
Or you can just wrap this with an equal.

21
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.950
Okay.

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.930
And the gesture detector has a property known as on top.

23
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.320
Okay.

24
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.150
And all we just have to do is to call the underscore page.

25
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.340
Controller and we are going to say jump to page and we have you can see is asking for the page and for

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.150
this we are going to pass the index of each image right about this index is basically referring to each

27
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.560
image we have.

28
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.940
Okay, now use control to save and go check this out.

29
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.410
Okay.

30
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.790
Click on this.

31
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.940
Click on this sim, right?

32
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.620
Okay.

33
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.020
And now we're going to deal with this number to update it to the current number we are selecting.

34
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.490
And to do that, the page view has a property known as own change.

35
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.630
And it is.

36
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.560
A callback.

37
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.260
What we have to do first is to.

38
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.140
Creates a finite variable and we're expecting a number, so we can just go ahead and say it is a type

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.100
of AIDS and we're going to call this variable in dense.

40
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.030
Right.

41
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.380
Okay.

42
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.430
Over in this.

43
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.570
Sorry.

44
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.640
We have to set it to zero.

45
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.450
Default.

46
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.750
Okay.

47
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.800
Click on this.

48
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.550
And.

49
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.030
Hawaii is going to take in the value that is the selected image.

50
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.620
And all we just have to do, first of all, is to set states in order to update the UI, because we're

51
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.640
basically going to update this number one to something else.

52
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.840
So we have to set the state, set states, and all we just have to do is to say index is equal to.

53
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.030
The value intense.

54
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.140
What did you call in then?

55
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.900
Yeah.

56
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.850
Just going gonna copy this hopefully.

57
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.250
And made no spell error.

58
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.470
In dance, it's going to be equal to value.

59
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.650
Okay.

60
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.600
And over in this, I think we have some hairs.

61
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.550
Was the same.

62
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.100
Okay.

63
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.810
So it can't be finer.

64
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.970
And get rid of this foreigner.

65
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.240
And that's all says Och.

66
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.420
And instead of this, what we can then do is we can get rid of this test widget for now.

67
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.770
Sorry.

68
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.480
Get rid of this.

69
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.930
Yeah.

70
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.390
And we're going to concatenate this.

71
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.950
How did the last line.

72
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.090
So every dollar and this is going to be intense.

73
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.300
And what we also have to say is plus.

74
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.680
Plus one.

75
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.399
Okay.

76
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.730
So what is going to do is anytime we click on this, it's going to update the index to one, two, three,

77
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.840
four, five, six.

78
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.150
And that is basically it.

79
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.420
So save now and go check this out.

80
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.850
Okay.

81
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.350
Okay.

82
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.020
One.

83
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.710
Two.

84
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.900
You can sit over the same school and hopefully you understand.

85
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.400
But if you don't, you can let me know.

86
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.470
Okay.

87
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.220
And lastly.

88
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.940
We also do need.

89
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.940
This and backslash, right?

90
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.830
Backslash and another.

91
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.830
Dollar sign.

92
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.500
This is going to be widget dot.

93
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.120
Sorry.

94
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.730
I think we are skipping that dollar.

95
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.380
Okay.

96
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.880
Give you a space.

97
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.710
And this is going to be widget dot what dot image lists dot lengths to give us the length of our image.

98
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.600
Okay.

99
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.040
And check it out.

100
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.870
Okay.

101
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.930
Sounds good, but we do not have that backslash.

102
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.370
Right.

103
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.600
Okay.

104
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:41.010
So what we can just do is we can get rid of this and we're going to use another type of concatenating.

105
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520
And I'm just going have the train come over here first.

106
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.040
And this is going to be.

107
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.370
In order to assess that, we have to say the last line again.

108
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.570
And this.

109
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.110
So this is going to be intense.

110
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.270
So not there.

111
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.890
Here.

112
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.400
Okay, then.

113
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.330
Plus one.

114
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.080
Plus.

115
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.330
Plus one.

116
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.500
And also what we have to do now is to use another plus.

117
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.230
Then empty string.

118
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.640
And this is going to be this.

119
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.300
Right.

120
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.690
And again, we then have to say.

121
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.090
Plus again.

122
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.970
And this is just going to be.

123
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.470
We just got.

124
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.510
Or you can just add another one again and this again.

125
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.230
All right.

126
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.740
Okay.

127
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.410
Well, this is just going to be a widget.

128
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.660
Dot image list, dot length dot string to convert it to a test.

129
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.190
So.

130
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.730
Yeah.

131
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.900
To convert it to a string.

132
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.250
Right.

133
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.980
Okay.

134
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.540
And you can see some school.

135
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.590
What is basically means is we are basically displaying the image the products have.

136
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:08.400
And over here we are getting the image the user is navigating to or switching to.

137
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.310
Okay.

138
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.090
You can see that that Siri is just static.

139
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.750
The theory is basically referring to the total image we have.

140
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.210
So what we can also do is we can give this a color of maybe colors that sign.

141
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.970
Okay.

142
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.280
The camera.

143
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.910
His concern is to save.

144
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.590
Okay.

145
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.080
Okay.

146
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.790
Seems cool.

147
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.960
Okay.

148
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.240
Let's go check for orders and.

149
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.760
Click on this.

150
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.410
We have just one image.

151
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.000
You can see one and one.

152
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.350
Okay.

153
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.030
Hopefully understand all this.

154
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.620
And if you don't, you can do.

155
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.730
Also, let me know.

156
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.790
I'm going to make another video for just you.

157
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.390
Okay.

158
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.100
Okay, guys.

159
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.750
See you in the next lecture.
