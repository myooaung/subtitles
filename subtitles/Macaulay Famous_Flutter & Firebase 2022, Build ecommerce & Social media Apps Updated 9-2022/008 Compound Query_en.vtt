00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.600
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.910
Now, what we are simply doing is we are fetching all the orders we have in our database.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.520
And that's me as a user who did not order any products is still going to see this.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.480
Okay.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.400
So I think this is going to be very confused.

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.290
Well, I have orders.

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.040
Orders without me ordering them.

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.450
Okay.

10
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.040
So what we are going to do in this lecture is we are going to fetch the orders that are associated to

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.710
that user.

12
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.110
Okay.

13
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.650
So in this lecture, we are going to talk about something known as compact query.

14
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.310
Okay.

15
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.970
So now to do this, we are going to need to go back to our visa code.

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.330
Okay.

17
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.310
So what we are trying to do is we are to go to fetch orders that are.

18
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.540
Ordered by that users that user are not just displaying all the orders for it now.

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.900
What we are simply doing is we have all the orders we have in our database.

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.400
So if you should create an account and log into it, you're still going to see this orders because we

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.790
are simply fetching all the orders we have in our database, same way we are fetching all the products

22
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.640
we have in database.

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.050
Okay.

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.050
So what we are going to do is we are going to fetch orders that are just relating to that user.

25
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.250
That is the orders, the user, the product the user holds.

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.640
Okay.

27
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.110
So that's whatever the fetch.

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.410
Okay.

29
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.060
So to do that, like I said, I will introduce you to something known as compact query.

30
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.470
Okay.

31
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.850
So over here, all we can say is we can then say dots.

32
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.020
Okay.

33
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.270
Before that gets to where you can see is asking for the field.

34
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.510
So all we can say is we a user, Heidi, can see that was why we have to have a field called user I.D.

35
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.550
so they can see where.

36
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.290
User I.D. karma is equal to.

37
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.500
Okay, so what we're going to do is firebase.

38
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.500
I think we already have this variable in the hearts that are in the cause tree.

39
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.550
So in the crossfire, though, it's correct.

40
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.780
User ID.

41
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.710
Okay.

42
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:25.790
I think we have to had in not that the reason for this is imagine colleges calling this variable calling

43
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.070
this fabulous odds that's crazy that you did one of these days the log in right.

44
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.730
So it's going to be no writes or essay is it can be null.

45
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.960
Okay.

46
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.350
So this is basically it.

47
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.600
So we only want to fetch the.

48
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.230
Aldous.

49
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.400
Yeah, the user ID is accords to the current user.

50
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.660
The current logged in user.

51
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.290
Right.

52
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.970
So this will simply fetch all products that is being ordered by just that user.

53
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.000
You can see before now what we are simply doing is we are having access to the orders collection and

54
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.170
then we are getting all the orders.

55
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.530
Okay.

56
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.390
But now we are using something known as compact query.

57
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.350
We are just filtering all the the products that is being ordered by the user.

58
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.910
You get it now.

59
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.110
So all the products.

60
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.370
That has this EU's unity.

61
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.260
That is the EU's idea of.

62
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.190
J g h i c p u t i and so on.

63
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.300
Those are the product.

64
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.710
Those are the products.

65
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.030
Those are the others that are going to be that are going to be retrieved.

66
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.450
Okay.

67
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.820
So that is what we are simply doing.

68
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.110
Okay.

69
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.930
Now we can use contra and save or you can just.

70
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.940
Or we start this.

71
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.510
Okay.

72
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.380
Okay.

73
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.790
All you can do is before.

74
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.550
Now, what you can just do is you can create some accounts.

75
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.160
You're going to see you're going to see this or there's a key.

76
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.090
What now?

77
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.760
Since we've done this, you are not going to see that.

78
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.800
You're not going to see this or that's again.

79
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:10.450
Since we ourselves will want to face the order that our words unique to that user.

80
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.670
You did so that are unique to that.

81
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.029
So the user idea, okay, I just fully understand this, but if you don't, you can as well.

82
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.050
Do not let me know.

83
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.300
So I'm will to try my best to explain it a bit deeper for you.

84
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.660
Okay.
