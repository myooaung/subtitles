00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.330
Walker, in this lecture, we're going to display the session users.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.310
Okay, but before then, we need to head up to this, which is our tree and then the video player,

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.420
IE10, and make sure you have this video play item to dispose before this spot to dispose so you can

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.490
copy it from the bottom and had that.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.790
So for this so far to dispose and as I said this is going to save you a half from future app crashes.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.730
Okay, so now we can use controller and that's the save.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.450
Okay.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.420
So now we need to head back to the views dietary and then the search for this screen and now we can

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.070
use contra and beats to make this way.

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.520
Okay.

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.200
Now the first step is to have access to this test controller class.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.380
So all we can do is we can create a find our variable and we can just go ahead and specify.

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.500
It is a type of what search controller and we can call this on this car.

15
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.319
Search controller and there's going to be a to this vicious end before it gets done.

16
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.320
Put.

17
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.130
Okay.

18
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.910
So now all we can do is we can a light and use contour and dots in the same parts.

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.200
Okay.

20
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.400
Okay.

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.930
Why switching that we can say switch.

22
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.100
Controller.

23
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.270
Right.

24
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.900
And over here, I like this contrarian duds.

25
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.700
Okay, Dan, we're going to impart from the get slash, get the dots.

26
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.800
And over here we need.

27
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.770
A semicolon.

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.280
Okay.

29
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.300
Now, the necessary to do is to be able to grab the value of what the user is going to type in.

30
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.260
Yeah.

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.700
Okay.

32
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.370
And.

33
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.100
Yeah, right.

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.490
Okay.

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.540
Yeah.

36
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.270
So to do that, we need to.

37
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.060
It says that it.

38
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.460
Right.

39
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.540
So you can just go ahead and say find her and go ahead and say it is a type of test and it's in controller.

40
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.100
And you can call this we can call this on the screen.

41
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.880
The more we can just search.

42
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.550
Controller.

43
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.400
It's going to be quite to test.

44
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.790
Editing controller adjusts the record and we tend to test field like we have this test from field or

45
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.770
via this test home field as well has a property known as controller.

46
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.310
So for this controller is going to be the search controller.

47
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.380
Okay, great.

48
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.250
Okay.

49
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.410
Okay.

50
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.930
So now with this, we are able to have access to whatever value this is going to type in.

51
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.790
Yeah, right.

52
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.160
Okay.

53
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.090
Now the next thing to do is to have some check.

54
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.460
So over here we can't say if search.

55
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.060
We're not using the F actually, but that's what we are trying to say.

56
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.120
If Satch Altschwager does.

57
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.720
But what?

58
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.830
Okay.

59
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.250
Sorry.

60
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.490
That technique by the said controller class that's going to be on this class.

61
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.530
Search controller.

62
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.000
Dot what?

63
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.050
Dot says users.

64
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.380
Says users.

65
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.890
Not the function, but the verb.

66
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.260
We have those issues as dots is empty.

67
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.520
That's means we are currently not searching for end users and that's means we want to display the center

68
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.970
widgets.

69
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.540
Right.

70
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.930
Okay.

71
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.850
And the value.

72
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.800
What we can do is at much lower, which is and where it starts.

73
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.150
Okay.

74
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.040
So over here it's NC.

75
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.370
Right.

76
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.710
We can then see else.

77
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.350
I'll answer it on her list.

78
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.310
View.

79
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.450
The other.

80
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.200
Okay.

81
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.280
For the item builder, this is going to be contest.

82
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.110
And.

83
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.320
Indians.

84
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.500
Right.

85
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.630
And we need a surveyor.

86
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.460
Okay.

87
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.340
And we are going to return a list.

88
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.930
Ty.

89
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.910
They start.

90
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.790
Okay.

91
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.680
So we call on here.

92
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.329
What we can do is.

93
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.589
Had your.

94
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.760
A common interest would have been very good for Matt.

95
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.200
Okay, great.

96
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.130
Now the next interview is we can basically just go ahead and dispel Ed by saying, okay, we can just

97
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.610
do this.

98
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.960
Item counts for the item count is going to be on this car search controller and that's what they'll

99
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.950
assess users and what lengths.

100
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.300
Okay.

101
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.000
This is going to give us I'm in use as we have with the same name.

102
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.660
Right.

103
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.090
Okay.

104
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:58.250
And as you know, this this guy has a property known as world leading.

105
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.620
Right.

106
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.350
So for the leading we can use.

107
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.870
A sequel, Avatar.

108
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.770
What to display the image and you can have the recurrent image and the image aspects in network image.

109
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.300
Okay.

110
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.740
So now what we need to do is before the return, we can create a finite variable.

111
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.480
I think you've seen all this before and we can call this search.

112
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.630
Search data.

113
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.220
And number two on this car search controller.

114
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.700
So what that says users and we can see we need.

115
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.950
Other users that have similar name.

116
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.490
Okay.

117
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.790
So over here we can then say search data and what starts row for to.

118
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.790
How the trachoma.

119
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.050
And.

120
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.680
Great.

121
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.920
And now all we need to do is to correct Dad's function.

122
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.520
We have quad session users, so it's in there.

123
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.600
Within the test home field.

124
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.580
The test home field has a property known as Aren Field submitted.

125
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.080
So now it has better function.

126
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.550
So we can use an arrow function.

127
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.460
And then say.

128
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.070
Search.

129
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.780
Controller.

130
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.480
So there it is.

131
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.960
That's something that's value.

132
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.530
Spanish controller.

133
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.670
Okay.

134
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.160
So we call this on this course, which.

135
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.840
Controller.

136
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.430
The word dot.

137
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.850
The function that is a search user.

138
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.850
And now we can then code that controller we have.

139
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.780
That is the search.

140
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.110
Controller hunting is going to be very confusing.

141
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.980
I want to see another way to do this.

142
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.400
And now we can see the test in lots of us.

143
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.160
This is the value.

144
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.570
Okay.

145
00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.100
Grids.

146
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.270
So where we are basically is that variable, that function we have.

147
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.770
And whatever the result is, we wanted the speed of it by easily.

148
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.580
See the view there.

149
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.270
First of all, we are saying if we don't have any sets or in this test either we want to display what

150
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.860
this edge uses test else water this plane is view the view there.

151
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.650
And once I have a lead in, I think lead is going to be at the left side, right and titles are going

152
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.950
to be at the middle and trail is going to be at the right.

153
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.430
Right.

154
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.810
Okay.

155
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.630
So currently we don't have any such users and that's why we're currently seeing this session is right

156
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.090
and what we can as well to in the that's a naked display every time that is a manual.

157
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.020
Submit this, we automatically display that says Jesus.

158
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.380
So what we can do is of others sleazy that either we can around this for us we distributor as well.

159
00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.210
I think you've seen this before and we can convert this to something we have also seen before.

160
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.890
That is the all the hex and now we can get rid of what we have.

161
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.570
What we have inside here.

162
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.080
And as well the builder.

163
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.280
Okay.

164
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:22.630
And also this a case controller and as to safe.

165
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.370
Okay.

166
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.440
I'm trying to be.

167
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.480
Well, we can just do it.

168
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.930
We can also start this.

169
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.860
We sat in and this is going to take some time and we can then give you this try.

170
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.700
Definitely there's not going to be any errors or issues.

171
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.190
Okay.

172
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.220
So now let's try this out.

173
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:45.970
Okay.

174
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.170
Okay.

175
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.530
We can go to the said screen and I think I have a name for it, Mark.

176
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.590
Okay.

177
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.840
Nothing has been displayed.

178
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.010
I'm just going to check my controller.

179
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.470
To see if we have any issues there.

180
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:10.990
Okay.

181
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:16.880
We are saying it's a gorgeous ash test and we can check run seminars to see if we have any issues as

182
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.240
well.

183
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.370
I'd support.

184
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.900
Okay.

185
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.630
We don't.

186
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.470
Okay.

187
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.120
Okay.

188
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.170
Well, now all we can do.

189
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.470
Instead of this.

190
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.070
Okay, let's go back to the search.

191
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.350
Says Just.

192
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.510
So it says screen.

193
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.790
And he said, oh, this says test we can pass in.

194
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.290
Value.

195
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.360
Again, this value is simply also referring to.

196
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.040
Well, we have a very odd case analysis controlling this to save.

197
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.760
And it continues to save.

198
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.470
And.

199
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:03.750
Okay.

200
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:13.050
You can see probably that was not the issue, but you can see this as this values referring to whatever.

201
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.350
We're going to have a problem, probably.

202
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.470
I'm just gonna do this.

203
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.650
Hopefully that was not the issue because it's the same thing.

204
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.830
You can use this and you can as well use that.

205
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:28.230
Value we have is basically referring to whatever infused we have by it.

206
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.340
Okay.

207
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.850
As well.

208
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.920
We don't just want to display that.

209
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.950
We also want to have the tie to.

210
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.280
Okay.

211
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.950
So you would send the list.

212
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:45.020
But outside of, say, cooperator, we want to have the title and it's going to be a test we get and

213
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.910
it's going to be, as said, deter and the name.

214
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.870
Okay.

215
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.280
Great.

216
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.670
Okay.

217
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.760
You can see it is display every time because y is in the obese.

218
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:08.390
Now what we can just do, like I said, you can see it does a set control either test or value or you

219
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:08.920
can just do it.

220
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.220
We can just go with the value.

221
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.270
Deval is also referring to whatever we have over it.

222
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.570
So both are saying, well, we can just go with the value.

223
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:18.750
Okay.

224
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.640
Now that's a have a much more readable code or any way you think is more readable and then we don't

225
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.570
longer need this.

226
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.760
I think this will also save us from some confusion and get rid of this.

227
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.490
Okay.

228
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.300
So I see the same and you can go with that.

229
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.880
Just note is the value of it is referring to whatever we have over here.

230
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.610
Okay.

231
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.050
So I can just.
