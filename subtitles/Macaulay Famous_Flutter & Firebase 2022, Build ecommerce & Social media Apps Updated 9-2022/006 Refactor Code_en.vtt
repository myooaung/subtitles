00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.700
In this lecture, we are going to refactor our code.

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.130
Okay?

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.700
To do this, we have to do this right over here.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.610
Or we can just do it right over this container, right this part.

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.490
And we have.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.860
So what we can do is alight and click on this.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:35.040
This last over here is tracked widgets and you can see it's asking for the name and it is a class.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.030
So we have to use a capital XA we can say products model and click on enter.

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.170
Okay, we're just going to click on Refactor anyway.

12
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.790
And you can see we have a lot of errors because you can see why we have this class over here.

13
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.980
So it does not know what.

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520
All this is that is the Indians.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.590
You can see basically we are having this intense.

16
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.350
Over a year.

17
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.260
And now this is an entire class.

18
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.080
Totally.

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.640
You can just see this as another screen entirely.

20
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.370
Right.

21
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.680
Okay.

22
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.610
So now what we can do is over here, we can create a finer variable and we're going to make this variable

23
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.500
dynamic.

24
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.970
And the reason for this is because you can see basically we have different type of value.

25
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.150
You can see this is a string that is the product image.

26
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.190
The product image is a string.

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.320
And you can see why the.

28
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.240
Product name is also string.

29
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
And this is also a list write list of images.

30
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.260
Right.

31
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.080
And you can see we have this price and this price is a double, right?

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.080
So that's the reason we are making this label dynamic.

33
00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.830
That is, it can allow any type of data and we're going to call this variable products.

34
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.870
And now what we have to do is to pass it on to the constructor by saying required and this is going

35
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.490
to be these DOT products as you're trying to cover.

36
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.940
And now you can see it is required over here wherever we are calling the product model.

37
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.500
So what we can then do is we can call that product and you can see it's asking for the value for the

38
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.710
value instead of having this.

39
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.370
Over.

40
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.280
Yeah, this all snapshot, the data, we can just have that variable studies.

41
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:49.140
So what we can then do, we can then say snapshot the data dot docs and we want to assess each of them

42
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.610
by their index.

43
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.840
And over here we need a well, we need to make it know.

44
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.530
Okay.

45
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.720
Okay.

46
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.350
And instead of this, we can just get rid of this because we already have this over.

47
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.060
Yeah.

48
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.900
Right.

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.130
So this is basically a variable to store that long coats for us.

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.190
So we have to get rid of this.

51
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.710
Right.

52
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.770
And we just have to call that product variable.

53
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.230
We have over there, I think, products.

54
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.300
Okay, Cisco.

55
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.630
And we're also going to do it for this.

56
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.880
Get rid of it.

57
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.960
Really have a rainbow for that.

58
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.370
And it's going to be products.

59
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.720
And click on this.

60
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.430
And so.

61
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.520
And get rid of this.

62
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.290
And there's going to be products.

63
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.900
Per Cox.

64
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.090
Okay.

65
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.680
Sorry.

66
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.100
A wire as well.

67
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.580
And this is basically it.

68
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.280
Okay.

69
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.830
Now, what we can then do is we can just call this out from here and create a new file for this.

70
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.900
And we are going to have that error now.

71
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.120
And in the views directory.

72
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.930
So in the views, yeah, we can then create a new folder which we are going to call widgets.

73
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.540
And over.

74
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.270
Yet we can then create a new file and we can call this product on the score model.

75
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.920
Thought that.

76
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.330
And now we can just pitch this right.

77
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.920
And definitely we have to import the material that that package.

78
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.860
You can see no errors again.

79
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.530
And now we have to import this to that file.

80
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.940
And.

81
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.900
Get rid of imports.

82
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.880
Cisco.

83
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.330
No errors.

84
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.710
No.

85
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.710
Harris.

86
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.810
And we also have to do this for the shoes category.

87
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.290
Sorry.

88
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.550
This is gallery.

89
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.980
Right.

90
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.470
So what we can just do is.

91
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.700
Is.

92
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.180
Is.

93
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.260
Is, is.

94
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.440
What we could do is to copy this man gallery to save our time.

95
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.330
I think this should be the more easier way you can just get rid of this.

96
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:34.050
Right and use control to allow it and use constraint C to copy and shoot gallery use constraint a to

97
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.330
a delete this and paste this.

98
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:46.530
And now what we have to do is to use a light and use constraint data, a light similar name and we have

99
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.730
to say shoes.

100
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.740
Gallery and screen.

101
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.530
Right.

102
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.620
And this is going to be for these shoes.

103
00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.500
Right.

104
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.480
I think we still have this era over there.

105
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.550
Shoes, gallery, screen.

106
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.330
Hmm.

107
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.330
What is the difference?

108
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.660
Okay.

109
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.520
Shoes.

110
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.720
This controller is going to have answers to all of them as.

111
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.450
And here's.

112
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.760
And Hess and Hess.

113
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.890
Okay.

114
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.660
What are the shoots gallery?

115
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.470
Okay.

116
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.000
We have double L.

117
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.660
Okay.

118
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.480
Is contrary.

119
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.140
Okay.

120
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.190
And this is going to be for shoes.

121
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.670
Right.

122
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.290
And we also have to do this for the women.

123
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.400
And let's get rid of that and.

124
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.840
Contra dee dee dee dee.

125
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.790
And this is going to be women.

126
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.160
Gallery and screen.

127
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.280
Okay.

128
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.310
And this is going to be women.

129
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.430
We still have that era.

130
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.550
I think we have a little spelling mistake.

131
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.650
This is going to be women.

132
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.030
We met Gallery.

133
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.020
Well.

134
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.310
So we know why.

135
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.230
I don't know what's wrong with me.

136
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.690
Okay.

137
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.310
So we've done for the shoes.

138
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.380
And I think the last one we have is the electronic.

139
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.400
So we have to allow it to get rid and push this.

140
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.920
And.

141
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.060
Contra Contra deconstructed contra dee dee.

142
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.420
And this is going to be like chronic.

143
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.910
Gallery.

144
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.510
Screen.

145
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.000
Corrects no spelling mistake.

146
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.820
And this is going to be what, Alec?

147
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.450
Electronics.

148
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.200
Okay.

149
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.790
Not electronics.

150
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.580
Electronics.

151
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.600
Make sure you don't have any spelling mistake.

152
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.410
Okay.

153
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:12.650
And Cisco for the I think I think our code is more simple.

154
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:14.780
Right.

155
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.440
Okay.

156
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.440
More easier.

157
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.860
And more.

158
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.840
He's there.

159
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.400
Right.

160
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.780
And more.

161
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.250
Easier.

162
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.900
Okay.

163
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.420
And that's good.

164
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.090
Check this out.

165
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.400
Hopefully no errors.

166
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.620
Definitely there should be no errors.

167
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.390
I don't really need to check this because there would be no errors.

168
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.809
It's basically the same thing.

169
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.770
Right?

170
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:42.370
Okay.

171
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.370
If you don't understand, please do well to let me know.

172
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.810
So I'm going to try my best to make things more easier for you.

173
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.240
Okay, guys, see you.
