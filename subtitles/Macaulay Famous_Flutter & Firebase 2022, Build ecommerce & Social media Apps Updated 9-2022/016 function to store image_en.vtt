00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.800
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.590
Now, before we stall, although our details in this class store database, what we're going to do first

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.050
is we're going to store the PICT image in this storage.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.620
Okay.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.970
Now, to get to this page, all you just have to do is to click on storage.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.790
Then you're going to see something like get started or create database I think is very easy to do.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.930
Then you're going to see production mode, you're going to see test results.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.950
So you can just choose between those in production mode or the test model.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.540
For me, I choose the test mode.

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.910
Okay.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
Then in testing, you're going to see you're going to see it's going to ask you to choose your zone.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.340
You can also go with the default by clicking on and level, and after that you're going to get to this

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.600
stage.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.290
Okay.

16
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.750
Now, everybody said we are going to store the Pict image in this storage.

17
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.140
Okay.

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.590
Now to do this, we're going to go to our previous record.

19
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.460
Okay?

20
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.540
Now, over here, we said if the user name, the email, the password, the image, if they are not

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.310
empty, that we want to create the user with the email and password.

22
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.970
But whether whether we just only go to create that user, we have our password, but as well we are

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630
going to store the peeked image.

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.160
So to do that over here.

25
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.370
After creating the user.

26
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.160
We also want to store the Pict image.

27
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.740
So to do that, we're just going to create a private function that created a private function because

28
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.540
we want the function to be only accessible within this file.

29
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.050
So to create a private function, all you have to do is use the underscore that we're going to call

30
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.000
this function upload.

31
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.890
Image.

32
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.430
Sorry.

33
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.230
Upload image to storage.

34
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.280
Okay.

35
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.760
Not a lot of us in the Picts image.

36
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.040
Okay, but how did that image over there?

37
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.080
Okay, now what I'm going to do, I will.

38
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.460
To create this function.

39
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.390
Abu.

40
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.170
Okay.

41
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.570
Isn't going to create.

42
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.600
It's all there.

43
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.120
Okay.

44
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.020
I just saw the comment upload.

45
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.600
I applaud.

46
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.840
Picked.

47
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.900
Image to storage.

48
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.430
Okay, great.

49
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.460
No.

50
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.140
There's going to be insurance.

51
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.500
There's going to be future.

52
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.230
It's going to be a type of shrink because is it is is a test.

53
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.950
I think the image is a euro.

54
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.370
Right.

55
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.690
It's going to be a shrink.

56
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.700
Okay.

57
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.230
So now we call this.

58
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.900
I'm just gonna copy what we call this.

59
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.030
Okay.

60
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.590
Okay.

61
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.890
As well.

62
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.070
I going to pass into it which is a type of high.

63
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.550
Okay.

64
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.450
Give you a space.

65
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.400
Okay, great.

66
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.810
Now, the first thing we are going to do, we are going to create a folder over there where all of our

67
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.880
images is going to be stored.

68
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.530
Okay.

69
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.060
Now, to do that, first of all, I'm just going to go to the cost fi.

70
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.620
Sorry the cost of I am going to create involved rebel rebel causes.

71
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.680
Rebel Firebase Storage.

72
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.230
Storage is going to be equal to the fire bays.

73
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.780
Storage dot is tons.

74
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.980
Okay, great.

75
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.200
They're going to refer to this over here.

76
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.480
So over here, they're going to set Firebase Storage.

77
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.650
Dot.

78
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.320
But what is going to be taught, Ralph?

79
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.080
Okay.

80
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.180
There is going to be dot chad.

81
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.470
There was never before.

82
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.650
The regular code is for the profi.

83
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.089
Profile pics.

84
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.959
Okay.

85
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.720
So with this we have created.

86
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.530
If what occurred for five weeks.

87
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.520
Okay.

88
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.410
So by doing fabric storage craft tied the name of the four we want to create.

89
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.300
In order for that, we want to create.

90
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.630
Okay.

91
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.960
Now, also, we're going to give the name of the fly.

92
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.620
Then we'll decide who's going to be the user name.

93
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.100
So to do that, we just have to see Dot tried again.

94
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.200
So we want the the name of the image to be the user name.

95
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.560
Right.

96
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.920
Oh, we just have to do is to use the Firebase Hearts, which has to do with our authentication so it

97
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.240
has access to the user.

98
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.770
So this is going to be darts.

99
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.740
Current.

100
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.410
Sorry for our base hearts.

101
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.100
Let's call this firebase.

102
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.500
Hearts of.

103
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.950
Okay.

104
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.820
They were going to say dot college user.

105
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.630
Okay, there dot you hide.

106
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.690
So we're going to hide our exclamation mark here to say it can't be.

107
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.150
No, we can not hide.

108
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.680
Effort to hide.

109
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.090
Okay, great.

110
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.730
Okay, great.

111
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.690
Now what we can also do, we can store this in a variable so we can store it in a real card with is

112
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.120
equal to this.

113
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.010
And it's going to be a type of.

114
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.710
With ferrets.

115
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.240
Okay.

116
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.620
Great.

117
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.410
Okay.

118
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.160
Great.

119
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.230
Now, if yours does not infiltrate, who is it?

120
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.540
You can use control DOD to protect it.

121
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.530
Okay, great.

122
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.680
Now we have the for the record, profile speaks the name of the image.

123
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.770
We should view the user name.

124
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.910
Okay.

125
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.940
So.

126
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.980
Okay.

127
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.740
So now what you're going to do next is to upload that image to our storage.

128
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.490
Okay.

129
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.610
So to do that, what we just have to do is to see this red dot.

130
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.320
Put.

131
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.650
Put FY there over the past in the pigs image.

132
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.720
Okay.

133
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.330
Was able to store this in a variable.

134
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.520
It expects its to be available code offload.

135
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.160
Task since we are uploaded each to the storage.

136
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.850
Okay.

137
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.450
So it's going to be a type of upload.

138
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.840
Upload talks as well.

139
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.740
Okay.

140
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.590
So we're going to see E core two.

141
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.940
Okay, great.

142
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.220
Not unless they were going to do.

143
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.730
I'll wait for the applauded.

144
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.210
So to do this, we're just going to say a task.

145
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.270
Toxic.

146
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.330
Snapshot.

147
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.590
There's going to be snap is equal to it then.

148
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.010
This offshore tax.

149
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.410
Offload task.

150
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.660
Then after you just wait.

151
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.150
We need to pass in the sake of it.

152
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.800
Okay, great.

153
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.650
Okay.

154
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.400
Great.

155
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.120
Now also remember I said.

156
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:52.360
We are going to assume sole auditors in this file store database.

157
00:07:52.780 --> 00:08:00.670
So now what you're going to do this is to get the other heel of that image in this storage because there

158
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.210
were no uploaded data in the past or database.

159
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.750
Okay.

160
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:13.000
To do that, we just have to do, first of all, is to see a snap.

161
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:21.310
Dirt Ralph and Dot gets the Lord Jarrell.

162
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.790
Okay.

163
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:29.110
So after flooded it with this, we will use this raft to try to upload the image.

164
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.880
Then over here we are getting that you are of the image.

165
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.240
Okay.

166
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.780
So that's what they're basically doing as well they're going to have with.

167
00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:46.160
With this ad, we are going to store the results in a variable called the load.

168
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.470
You are real.

169
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.040
Okay.

170
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.800
Now is going to be a type of string.

171
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.930
All right.

172
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.100
So this is an image.

173
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.050
So abilities equals to you.

174
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.250
Okay, good.

175
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.050
Now what you can do now.

176
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.550
They're just going to say retard.

177
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.400
The download.

178
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.590
Download.

179
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.130
Download URL.

180
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.120
Okay, great.

181
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:23.740
So over here we said ref which is a variable is equal to firebase storage dot ref.

182
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.160
The chat.

183
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.190
So over here we said the name of the food is going to be four, five feet.

184
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:36.060
That is we are all our image is going to be stored is going to be called prosthetics in a way.

185
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:43.440
We said the child again, we said the name of the image or the FY is going to be the user ID.

186
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.640
That is the user name.

187
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.440
Okay, well, more like these and you're going to see this shortly.

188
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:59.180
Then over here we said we have to put PHI in order to upload the user image right over here.

189
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:06.170
We created a variable and expect it to record upload talks since we uploaded an image with this report.

190
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.350
Fruit fly and we said is a type of upload talks that over you.

191
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.360
We are awaited.

192
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:18.730
We are waiting for the image to upload as automatically doing that awaits upload task that I said we

193
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.250
are also going to store the.

194
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:27.190
Image in this story, image URL in this class store database.

195
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.550
Right.

196
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:34.630
So what I simply did here was to get the Jarrell of the image.

197
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.600
Okay, then we are returning the URL.

198
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.490
Okay, great.

199
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.640
So over a year we had as well.

200
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:46.900
See the.

201
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.000
The Lord.

202
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.910
Download.

203
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.620
You are ill equipped to do I just because I waited first.

204
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.510
Okay, great.

205
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.470
So this is basically it.

206
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:08.760
So we just we we asked essentially created the function to upload the image.

207
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:17.930
And we also want to retrieve it by using this over here was able to retrieve that image that that's

208
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.690
the tree of the image.

209
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:25.260
Jarrell, because they're going to upload it in this plaster database.

210
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:25.620
Okay.

211
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.520
So that's basically it's okay, guys, see this?

212
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:28.680
That.
