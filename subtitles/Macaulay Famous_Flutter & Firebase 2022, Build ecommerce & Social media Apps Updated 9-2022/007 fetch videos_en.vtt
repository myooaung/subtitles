00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.550
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.390
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.290
In this lecture, we are going to finish the uploaded videos.

4
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.119
Okay, not to do this.

5
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.520
We're going to need to go back to our vious record.

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.400
And as you know, the controller's territory is where we're going to be creating all our logics.

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.470
Okay, so what is controllers that try regularly to create a new phy and we're going to call this FY

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.480
video on this car controller.

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.700
And yes, picture the arch debt.

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.780
Okay.

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.720
And now we can then use control B to make this right.

12
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.170
Okay.

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.270
The first thing is we're going to need to create a class and we're going to call this class video controller.

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.750
Okay.

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.740
And we can extend from the get s controller.

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.100
Okay.

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.490
Now, what we can do is we can get rid of all this.

18
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.930
We can just get rid of all this and a light and use controlled.

19
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.200
They're going to be important from the gets large gets.

20
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.650
Okay.

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.120
So we have access to all the get us packages.

22
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.540
Okay.

23
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.150
Now the first thing to do is to create an empty video.

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.150
Least the case it's did is where you're going to create a finite variable and you're going to specify

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.640
that is going to be a type of arrest.

26
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.850
What is arrest is going to do is there's no listing for changes we are making to the videos.

27
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.870
Okay.

28
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.950
And we can specify it is a type of list.

29
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.450
And now going to need to call the vigil modo.

30
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.270
Okay.

31
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.010
You find the reason EOS did not get imported lights and use control dots.

32
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.180
And now we need to greater down.

33
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.630
Okay.

34
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.600
Now you're going to create a private rebel so you can see on this car video.

35
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.420
Least then it's going to be equal to the same thing.

36
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.280
Okay.

37
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.130
Well, this time around, we're going to wrap it with this and say it is an empty list that has.

38
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.510
A semicolon.

39
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.960
Okay.

40
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.850
Now, for the now, what we simply did is at this moment, we do not have any videos in this uses.

41
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.940
So in this video collection.

42
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.330
Okay.

43
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.940
Now, as you know, this is a private variable.

44
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.610
So it's a look in the best possible within this class or within this file.

45
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.660
So now all we can do is we can make it globally accepted.

46
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.790
So to make this globally accepted, we are going to need to create a getter so over.

47
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.860
Yet we can see list and.

48
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.620
As well.

49
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.720
The type of variable is going to be the video model.

50
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.220
You can see over here in the model Zaatari, we have this video class.

51
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.980
So this are the fields we are trying to refer to.

52
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.690
Okay.

53
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.930
And now we can then say get.

54
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.270
And now we are going to create a variable which is not going to be private and as what is going to be

55
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.060
called video list.

56
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.370
And now we can then use another function.

57
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.260
And then called out on this car.

58
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.080
Video, Liz Ribble.

59
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.720
And then we'll just says the value which is simply this okay for the now we said the figure is empty.

60
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.080
Okay.

61
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.860
So by doing this, we are transferring what is there?

62
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.910
So this.

63
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.500
Very now I cannot within make it private.

64
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.700
So it's not going to be us.

65
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.070
It's not going to be generally available.

66
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.550
Okay.

67
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.710
Now, what we need to do is to create something known as a needs.

68
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.260
So on it's on in.

69
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.860
Sorry.

70
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.820
So this is something similar to the in this states.

71
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.110
Whatever we do here is going to get drawn immediately.

72
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.710
The screen laws.

73
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.150
Okay.

74
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.060
So over a year.

75
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.650
We can't just get rid of this.

76
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:14.270
Over year revenue need to call that we've acquired so we acquire within make it private video list.

77
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.730
Then we need to say dogs bind stream and now all we need to do is to have access to those videos collection.

78
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.890
Because once I have access to all the documents we have and for now we just have two documents, that

79
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.300
is two videos.

80
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.560
Okay.

81
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.350
Now to have access to the coalition, we need to codify I think we called it fire.

82
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.350
Faster.

83
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.800
First.

84
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.190
Right.

85
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.500
And we condense that collection.

86
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.630
And the collection is what?

87
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.430
The.

88
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.790
The ideas.

89
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.830
Right.

90
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.410
Okay.

91
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.790
And.

92
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.210
Now we need to say dots.

93
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.020
Snap shut.

94
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.570
And Dodd's map.

95
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.310
That is a running look over each document we have.

96
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.740
And for now, we just have to document.

97
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.210
Okay.

98
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.130
And now we can get rid of this and break this to the next line.

99
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.730
Okay.

100
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.130
Now he's asking for the votes.

101
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.580
Okay.

102
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.540
Now we're referring to all the documents we have in the videos.

103
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.450
These documents is known as each video is known as document snapshot.

104
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.780
What all videos puts together is referred to as query snapshots.

105
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.900
So we need to specify the event or value that it is a type of what's query.

106
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.810
Snapshots after looking over each document, then it's not going to be words.

107
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.310
Document snapshots.

108
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.890
Okay, so you understand this, and now we can just specify it type of query.

109
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.100
Okay.

110
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.940
You can also go with the query snapshot and now as well.

111
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.720
What we need to do is we are seeking to create an entity list.

112
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.320
And it's going to be a time of the video model.

113
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.950
And the stimulus is required to.

114
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.320
And into this.

115
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.350
So we can just create a way to store the results again for this return value.

116
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.040
Okay.

117
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.990
And this.

118
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.830
Okay.

119
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.800
And now we can look.

120
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.130
Okay.

121
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.450
So we can just had.

122
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.450
It's an error, so we can just have this.

123
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.140
Okay.

124
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.450
And now we can then look over these documents.

125
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.640
And for the now we have just two documents.

126
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.160
Okay.

127
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.160
Now, to do this, all we just have to say is for.

128
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.820
For.

129
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.570
Okay.

130
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.650
We can just use this.

131
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.290
We can then see for.

132
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.960
Were.

133
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.430
In.

134
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.880
Sorry.

135
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.130
You can get rid of this for.

136
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.000
Elements.

137
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.790
Elements, elements, elements.

138
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.040
Elements.

139
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.800
In.

140
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.160
Query.

141
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.210
Okay.

142
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.520
Okay.

143
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.820
I think we call this.

144
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.310
Record this query dot.

145
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.500
Dot.

146
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.350
Dos.

147
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.190
Okay.

148
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.400
The stocks.

149
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.050
And what we need to do is to then say.

150
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.480
Once every time I think we have this element error.

151
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.170
Okay.

152
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.790
I think it's in knots.

153
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.470
Used.

154
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.800
We're just gonna check this out, okay?

155
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.050
Okay.

156
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.960
Yeah, we can say four elements.

157
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.220
Four elements.

158
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.700
Four elements in query.

159
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.250
That's one to look over each document.

160
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.580
Right.

161
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.920
And now we can then say return value.

162
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.920
That's hot.

163
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.190
Okay.

164
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.270
Just to copy this.

165
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.030
The key.

166
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.370
Club pitches.

167
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.760
And -- then darts hearts they want to add to that list.

168
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.760
So I think we need this.

169
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.590
Okay.

170
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.330
Once I had that list and.

171
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.590
That's hard.

172
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.340
Get okay over here.

173
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.400
This is going to be the video.

174
00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:46.150
I think there's a lot the video the what's the it's from.

175
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.050
Snap.

176
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.540
Okay.

177
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.880
And over here we need to pass in the elements.

178
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.160
Okay.

179
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.710
Okay.

180
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.170
Okay.

181
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.480
This is basically it.

182
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.590
I think we need this.

183
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.500
I mean, it's going to hover, and this is what we need.

184
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.370
Okay.

185
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:04.850
This.

186
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.750
So I think.

187
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.730
Over in this indecency.

188
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.850
Okay.

189
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.440
We need an addition.

190
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.060
And over in this.

191
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.970
Okay.

192
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.960
We're just going to look.

193
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.300
Now, lastly, we need to say.

194
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.330
Over year.

195
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.360
I'm just going to have this.

196
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.310
And now we need to see return.

197
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.050
Want to turn the.

198
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.520
It's over.

199
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.370
Okay.

200
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.530
Isn't it?

201
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.350
Get rid of this.

202
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.880
Okay, great.

203
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.130
This is basically it.

204
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.500
First of all, we created an entity list and we call this repo video list.

205
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.550
And as you know, we're not going to be able to access this in other ways.

206
00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:03.420
So what we did was to override this by creating this and via raising the only net, which I said is

207
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.640
similar to the in this state.

208
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.870
Then we are calling this Rainbow Warrior.

209
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.600
And we have we said bind stream.

210
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:19.640
Then once I have access to the video collection and the snaps, then want to map over each documents

211
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.150
we have.

212
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.100
Every documents put together is referred to as document snapshots.

213
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.960
So now we have looked.

214
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.470
That's means we are looking over each document.

215
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.470
And each document is referred to as what?

216
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.490
Query snapshots.

217
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.760
What all puts together is referred to as what's.

218
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.370
All put together separate sized query snapshot what each document is known as document snapshots.

219
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:51.240
So at this stage, at this stage, it's his query snapshot.

220
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.700
But mainly we map true at this stage.

221
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.770
So it is query snapshot.

222
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.830
But a manual mapped to each document is not known.

223
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.360
That's what's.

224
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.260
Document, snapshot and overlay.

225
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:10.820
We also created a readable called Rets value return value, which is we just add value and is also required

226
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.780
to empty.

227
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:19.790
And over here we are simply adding to this list in the value we are simply was returning the value.

228
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.190
I think there's a lot I think this is more easier to do when using a provider.

229
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:32.720
I think I use a provider in the ecommerce section and I think this is this is a bit similar to that

230
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.840
of the provider, but this is a bit complex.

231
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.050
You want to know how to do this with provider.

232
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.910
You can wash the e-commerce section where I did something similar to this.

233
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:53.780
I think that's more easy to understand than this because in that section I use provider and of I'm using

234
00:11:53.780 --> 00:12:02.780
get is okay guys this is basically it so we have successfully fetched our data from our videos so went

235
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.270
over.

236
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:10.010
This video's collection and we run the look over each item and that's a display that.

237
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.310
And is basically it's okay, guys.

238
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.980
See you and in this lecture.
