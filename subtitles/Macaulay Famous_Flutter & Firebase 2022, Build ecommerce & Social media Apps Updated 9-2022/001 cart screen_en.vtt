00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.240
In this lecture, regional design discussed between well before then.

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.640
If the user has not had it any product to their carts, then we're just going to display an image of

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.090
where on the test, which is just going to say your cards is empty.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Okay, now to do this, we're gonna need to go back to our visit quote, okay?

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.700
Over this widget directory, we're going to create a new PHI and we're going to call this PHI Cards

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.230
on this call empty then section, which is dot dot.

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.170
Okay.

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.440
And now we can use control and B to make this wide.

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.540
And we can use this.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.380
Did this widget.

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.120
Okay.

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.430
And we're going to call this as well.

15
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.270
Cuts empty in over.

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.040
We can alight and use control and darts in order to have parts the material that that package.

17
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.060
Now like I said, we're going to have two widgets, right?

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.240
Or probably we can have more, but both widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.660
That is from top to bottom.

20
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.290
Right.

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.650
Okay.

22
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.410
So is it a free container in order to display widget vertically from top to bottom?

23
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.530
We're going to be using the widgets known as column.

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.700
And as you know, iCloud widgets can accept multiple widgets.

25
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.040
So it's as rich as your property.

26
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.120
Okay, now the first site is going to be a container.

27
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.430
That is the container of the image.

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.200
And for the container, we can give this a wheat only hot for the wheat.

29
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.610
They're just going to say wheat.

30
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.620
Then you're going to say double.

31
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.100
Dot infinity.

32
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.520
So this is this is going to take the available space.

33
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.250
And that's all you can give a height to this.

34
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.960
Now for the Ides, we are going to get the height screen to do that.

35
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.540
Recall.

36
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.020
No need to say media query.

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.310
They're out of context.

38
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.090
Then the size dots are hot.

39
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.180
So by doing this, we are going to get the height of the screen.

40
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.910
Then we can just say we want to.

41
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.360
Times it's by.

42
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.760
0.4.

43
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.950
Okay, great.

44
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.370
Now, the next thing we're going to do is a declaration and box declaration.

45
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.390
Okay.

46
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.410
Great.

47
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.800
And we can have now the image.

48
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.240
This is going to be.

49
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.180
Decoration.

50
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.120
Image rights.

51
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.480
Okay.

52
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.620
There's asking for the URL of the image.

53
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.240
You're going to see assets that sets image.

54
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.850
So assets image.

55
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.320
Right.

56
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.670
Okay.

57
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.020
Now the URL.

58
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.510
Okay.

59
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.350
I'm going to go through and be okay.

60
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.270
I'm going to go to my assets.

61
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.470
Images.

62
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.850
Okay.

63
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.490
You can see we have this.

64
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.300
Okay.

65
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.590
And courts.

66
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.880
All right.

67
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.220
Okay.

68
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.120
Now the location is assets slash words.

69
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.810
Images and a number of the images.

70
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.940
Empty.

71
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.990
Cards, Dot.

72
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.530
Okay.

73
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.480
Noise control necessary.

74
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.980
Now it collapses.

75
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.360
Okay.

76
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.380
Okay.

77
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.150
Now we are going to go to the.

78
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.980
It cuts screen right away screens.

79
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.630
Then cut screen.

80
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.050
Okay.

81
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.220
Now you're going to get rid of this center and we're going to use the cuts.

82
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.140
So we record recorded empty.

83
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.570
Courts.

84
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.230
Right.

85
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.620
Okay.

86
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.300
So I see a record.

87
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.380
It's constancy.

88
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.890
Okay.

89
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.540
Okay.

90
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.380
And I'll alight and is continuing.

91
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.740
That's.

92
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.940
Okay.

93
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.540
Great.

94
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.890
Now this question excessive.

95
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.810
And go check it out.

96
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.770
Okay.

97
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.320
Great.

98
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.670
Now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to have it set, right?

99
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.500
So we're going to go back to the widgets there.

100
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.150
We're going to go back to the carts empty.

101
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.640
Okay.

102
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.240
We take the call.

103
00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.750
All right.

104
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.800
Okay.

105
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.180
Within the story.

106
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.040
After the container within the column.

107
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.350
Right.

108
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.670
Okay.

109
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.350
Then we can have a test.

110
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.890
Widgets.

111
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.750
It says we get.

112
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.500
And we should just going to say your.

113
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.470
Cards.

114
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.040
Is empty.

115
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.230
Right we can give his side to this is going to check it out first.

116
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.730
Okay.

117
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.770
We can give you a start.

118
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.070
It is because his tie is going to be test tie.

119
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.880
Right.

120
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.250
Okay.

121
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.320
I can give you a font size.

122
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.690
Font size of 30 and font suites.

123
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.440
Fun tweets.

124
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.400
DEADBOLT.

125
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.840
Okay.

126
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.050
Go check it out.

127
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.820
Right.

128
00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.210
Okay.

129
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.680
Now we can just take this to the center.

130
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.640
Why we can't use the main access arrangements when access amendments.

131
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.800
That center is going to take it center vertically.

132
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.970
Okay.

133
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.570
Great.

134
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.760
Your card is empty, right?

135
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.150
Okay.

136
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.510
Looking great.

137
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.880
Okay, guys, seen in this picture.
