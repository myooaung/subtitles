00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.660
In this lecture, we are going to create the functionality in order to highlight products to our wish

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.990
list.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.500
Okay, now, before we create the wish list screen, we can just go ahead and create the functionality.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.720
So have product to our wish list.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.250
Okay.

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.110
To do this, we the provider directory, we are going to create a new file and we can call this file

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
which lists the scope provider.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.750
Then the dot is going to look very similar to that of the card provider.

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.090
So we can just alight everything over here and its control and copy and paste this and over here we

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.860
are going to rename the class.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
This is going to be a wish list provider.

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.150
And also this is going to be a get.

15
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.230
Wish item.

16
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.250
Which item?

17
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.830
Okay.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.600
And we do not need this to surprise.

19
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.680
Get rid of it.

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.270
We also want to get the length of the.

21
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.620
They had said which products and we are going to rename this to say add which item.

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.860
Okay.

23
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.440
And we do not need the equipment and equipment.

24
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.860
We need this clear cut.

25
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.430
We're just going to rename this to Claire.

26
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.170
Claire which.

27
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.830
Great.

28
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.100
And now we have to tell our men that fi that we have a new provider called which list.

29
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.590
To do this we have to go to the main dot dot.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.250
And over you had your train come and we are going to have another change notifier.

31
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.390
Change the to fire and for this creates we are going to use an underscore to say it can be empty.

32
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.030
And we are then going to return the witch.

33
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.220
Provider.

34
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.600
Okay grids and use control necessary.

35
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.160
And this is all we need to do in the main dot file and now we can create the screen within the views

36
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.940
directory.

37
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.650
We are going to create a new file and we can call this file which list underscore screen and or dot

38
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.030
and it's going to looks very similar to that of the car screen.

39
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.230
So in this cut screen we can just alight everything and copy.

40
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.790
And we can then paste it in this wish list screen.

41
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.870
And now we have to rename this.

42
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.490
This is going to be a wish list.

43
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.300
Okay.

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.270
And also for this test.

45
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.640
This is going to be rich list.

46
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.310
Okay.

47
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.220
And.

48
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.510
This is going to be a wish list.

49
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.520
Wish list.

50
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.980
Wish list provider.

51
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.360
And we want to assess the clear.

52
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.060
Claire.

53
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.810
Which.

54
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.000
Okay, great.

55
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.970
So, Claire, the witch.

56
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.550
And for this contestant.

57
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.930
Watch, we are basically checking if the if we have a cast item or not.

58
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.050
So this is going to be if we have which list, item or not.

59
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.510
So this is going to be from the witch.

60
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.870
Which list provider.

61
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.310
And this should be.

62
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.610
Gets which items OC.

63
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.050
Great.

64
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.880
And so this variable called cards provider, we have to rename this to which provider?

65
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.150
And this is going to be which provider.

66
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.310
Which provider counts to get how many?

67
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.350
Hi Tim.

68
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.610
We have heard that how many.

69
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.070
Which we have had that and we have to just rename this to.

70
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.070
Which which.

71
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.090
Writer.

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.010
And.

73
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.410
Which.

74
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.019
Provider.

75
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.120
Okay.

76
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.110
And this is going to be which.

77
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.200
Which provider?

78
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.580
Okay.

79
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:40.410
And you can see we have this rule and this rule is basically for the quantity and the order is for the

80
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.950
document.

81
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.490
Right?

82
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.360
So what we can just do is we can get rid of this child.

83
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.080
And.

84
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.780
It ends over here.

85
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.370
Okay.

86
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.830
Okay.

87
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.790
Great.

88
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.640
Use control and save.

89
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.600
Okay.

90
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.660
And lastly, when we when we click on this, we want to be able to hide it.

91
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.520
To do this, we have to go to.

92
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:22.970
The product detail, product detail folder and end product detail and.

93
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.110
We are just going to copy.

94
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.880
Copy.

95
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.830
I think we have this over here.

96
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.060
Okay.

97
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.560
It has copy from this part.

98
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.300
See to copy and screw up this contrast between this wide.

99
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.680
Screw up.

100
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.690
Look, you can see we have this over here and his this.

101
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.930
And this is going to be from the rich list provider which lays provider.

102
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.330
And this is going to be get which items.

103
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.740
And.

104
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.880
And I think we have the heart.

105
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.500
And this is going to be.

106
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.140
From the witch list provider.

107
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.970
And we also had the witch item.

108
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.190
And this is basically all we need to do via.

109
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.010
Okay.

110
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.230
And now when we click on this, when we click on this.

111
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.710
Sorry.

112
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.070
When we click on.

113
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.060
This wish list.

114
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.920
We want to go to that with the screen.

115
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.860
So to do that, we have to go to the profile screen.

116
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.890
Profile screen.

117
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.240
And you can see we have that which this and we basically wrapped everything up with the test button

118
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.910
so we can then say navigator.

119
00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.800
It.

120
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.140
What?

121
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.660
That push.

122
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.670
Is asking for the roots or roots.

123
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.240
This is going to be much severe.

124
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.400
Page material, Page wrote.

125
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.370
And contests.

126
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.850
And we then want to return.

127
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.330
What?

128
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.030
We then want to return the witch list screen.

129
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.460
Sorry.

130
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.800
Which list?

131
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.780
Screen.

132
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.240
What did you call that?

133
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.630
I think we have.

134
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.020
Which.

135
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.650
Let's.

136
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.590
Okay.

137
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.010
I'm just going to check what we called it.

138
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.930
Okay.

139
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.500
We are going to rename this to which the screen.

140
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.440
And in the middle of that five.

141
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.030
We also do have to say.

142
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.850
Commander.

143
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.590
Okay.

144
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.410
No, nothing.

145
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.970
We are not using that screen.

146
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.940
And this is going to be a return.

147
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.150
Which list?

148
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.390

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.890
We start.

156
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.440

And let's just check that first to see click on which this and you can see currently we have nothing.

168
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.010
You can also just rename that test.

169
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.560
Okay.

170
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.860

Your item is in cards already as this or something like that.

177
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.940
We can check it out.

178

Okay.

179
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.760
We do not have it displayed.

181
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.310
Okay.

Let's go to the wish list screen to see what we are not doing right.

184
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.050
Okay.

185
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.340
Sorry.

186
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.020

188
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.200
Okay.

189
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.760
Make sure you don't make such mistake, which let's provide.

190
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.700
Okay.

191
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.380
So you get rid of this.

192
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.710
They called us to see what we were.

193
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.730
Okay.

194
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.050
Sorry.

195
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.880
This should be get.

196
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.410
Which item?

197
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.230
Get.

198
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.130
You did get which item?

199
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.560
And click on this to see what we are missing again and get to it with this.

200
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.790
You should forget which items.

201
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.450
Okay.

202
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.340
Now, if you've forgotten why why we are doing this, or if you don't know why we are doing this, you

203
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.600
can just check how we created the functionality for the cards.

204
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.550
And this is basically it.

205
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.580
And it should it should work as expected.

206
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.670
You can see currently we have it and you can see we got rid of that quantity already and we do not need

207
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.310
that bottom --.

208
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.550
So we can get rid of that via.

209
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.290
And it ends.

210
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.400
Why?

211
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.010
I think it's necessary.

212
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.830
And you're not going to see it anymore.

213
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.210
Okay.

214
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.340
Okay.

215
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:40.160
And we can just try so hard on other products to be sure everything is working as expected.

216
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.120
Click on this.

217
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.160
And first of all, in the.

218
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.580
In the product detail.

219
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:56.270
If we already have that product, we then want to say item already in.

220
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.320
Which.

221
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.020
Which list?

222
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.660
And in the car screen.

223
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.450
Touch screen.

224
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.370
For this order.

225
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.050
We want to say your.

226
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.570
Your wish list.

227
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.830
These empty seats are necessary now.

228
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.780
And let's try.

229
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.360
But again.

230
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.110
And.

231
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.360
Click on this.

232
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:37.020
So you know this but this you can see item already in which list and that's go check our wish list.

233
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:38.960
Check.

234
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:39.660
Okay.

235
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.020
Yes.

236
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.830
Answer now.

237
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.910
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
