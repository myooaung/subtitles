00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
In this lecture, we're going to wrap everything up with an obese.

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.610
And the reason for the obese is whenever a user search for other users, we want to be able to display

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.770
those users in real time.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.840
Okay, then let's do this.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.110
We need to go back to our VTS code and then.

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
The search screen and now we can use control a, b to make this wide.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.190
And what we can do is we're going to use this, which you've said before.

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.260
So over the scaffold.

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.530
We can then alight and then use control and dots.

12
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.070
Then we can, first of all, rob this wheat distributor.

13
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.980
Then over distributor.

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.270
We can then rename it to this, which you sell before.

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.510
That is the whole piece.

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.970
Okay.

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:58.440
The reason for this is immediately we search for any user who wants that user to be automatically displayed

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.420
in real time.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.040
Okay, so we can get rid of this and as well we need to get rid of what we have over here.

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.680
Okay.

21
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.410
Had as well.

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.960
What we have over here.

23
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.080
Dead.

24
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.020
You can get rid of this.

25
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.090
Okay, great.

26
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.760
So now what we can do now is to how to start this over here.

27
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.850
And now we can try this out ourselves.

28
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.050
This is the hottest tab, this app.

29
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.720
And we just need to wait for this.

30
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.320
Okay.

31
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.950
It's going to start this now.

32
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.910
Okay, great.

33
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.020
So now we can try to search for a user.

34
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.890
Let's go to the screen quickly.

35
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.870
Key says screen.

36
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.110
And over here you can search for Mac and click on Enter.

37
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.040
If you go to see Mac over here, you can see it's been displayed real time.

38
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.080
So what we can as well do is when we click over this, Mac wants to go to the profile of Mac.

39
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
So now what we're going to need to do now is to use control at beat.

40
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.880
So make this smaller and then over the screens directory regularly to create a new file.

41
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.130
And we're going to call this file profile on the score screen.

42
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.840
And as you know, the section is dot dot.

43
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.960
And now we can use control and B, to make this fight and we can create a stateless widget for now.

44
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.590
And since we can change it to a set for widgets if the need arises as well, we could call this profile

45
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.920
screen and what we have to do over here is to alight and then use control dots in order to import the

46
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.070
material to that package and.

47
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.580
What we can basically do for now is to return a center widget in order to send the next widget we're

48
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.450
going to be using.

49
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.080
And now we can have a child.

50
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.740
Chide.

51
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.570
Chide.

52
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.810
Which is going to be a test we jet and it's just going to say for now provide screen.

53
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.330
Okay.

54
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.800
We can just cut through and save and then head back to our screen.

55
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.280
Okay.

56
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.790
Now, over this list, view the builder.

57
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.530
We can wrap this with the bottle by highlighting and then use control and dots wrap with widgets.

58
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.450
We're going to wrap this widget with a type of button known as gesture detector.

59
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.850
And as you know, the gesture detector has a property known as on tap.

60
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.390
On top of that, we want to say navigator.

61
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.590
Navigator Dot.

62
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.440
Push.

63
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.690
It can just go ahead and say push.

64
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.160
You can see it as well past the context to it.

65
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:05.570
And this is going to be material page roots and it is the context, as you know.

66
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.130
And we can then return the profile script.

67
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.970
We just create that profile screen.

68
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.230
Okay, great.

69
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.089
And as well, we did a trick.

70
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.250
So we did a semicolon over here and we can just also start this again.

71
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.810
And.

72
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.030
It's going to take us back to our first screen.

73
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.090
That is the home.

74
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.570
And.

75
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.130
We can then head back to the screen and search for Mark.

76
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.940
You can see it's going to pop out right up and we can click on this.

77
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.320
Okay, great.

78
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.280
So basically, they trapped this with the scaffold, right?

79
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.150
Says Creed.

80
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.910
So, Professor Creed.

81
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.010
And instead of this, we need to wrap this with scaffold.

82
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.430
Stafford.

83
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.800
If not have access to lots of properties at the DOT to have access to that white background.

84
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.260
So this going to be sator.

85
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.000
The child is going to be a test for now, which is just going to say profile screened.

86
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.390
Okay.

87
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.760
Great.

88
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.700
Okay.

89
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.120
Great.

90
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.670
Okay.

91
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.970
Now, if you have any other questions or probably you don't understand what we just did, you can do

92
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.780
what we do.

93
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.790
And I'm fully available to answer all your questions, to answer all your dubs.

94
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.040
Okay, guys, see you at this lecture.
