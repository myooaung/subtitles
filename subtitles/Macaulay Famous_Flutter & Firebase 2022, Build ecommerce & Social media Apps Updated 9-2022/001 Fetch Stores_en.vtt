00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.620
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.750
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.260
In this lecture, we are going to create the store screen and also we are going to be able to retrieve

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.270
our seller's store.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.560
Okay, not to do this, we have to head back to our VTS code and then the views directory.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.430
And now we are going to create a new Fae and we're going to call this Fae star on the score screen.

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.320
Then the dots.

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.210
And what we can do is we can use control and B to make this wide and we can go with the stateless widget

9
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.040
and we're going to call this store store screen.

10
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.710
And over here we need to alight and use control dots in order to impart the material to that package.

11
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.500
And we can get rid of this OC in order to have access to a lot of property.

12
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.840
What we can then do is to get rid of this container and we're going to use a scaffold with that scaffold.

13
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.580
And as you know, the scaffold has a property known as harbour and harbour.

14
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.600
And the harbour has a property known as title, and it's going to be a test widget which is just going

15
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.360
to say Store how you train a camera and use control and has to save.

16
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.280
And back to the sailor home.

17
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.930
And we are going to get rid of this center of air and then we can call the store screen.

18
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.130
Okay.

19
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.680
And now we need an auto restart.

20
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.460
Work is going to take some time to restart and then we have to re log in again and hopefully everything

21
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.320
is going to work as expected.

22
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.420
Okay.

23
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.580
Back to the seller Logan Screen.

24
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.510
And.

25
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.970
Famous.

26
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.250
T.M. Gmail.

27
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.650
It's called password.

28
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.360
Why?

29
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.110
Okay.

30
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.830
It's going to take us to the cellar screen.

31
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.010
And I think we call the shop.

32
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.540
You can just rename that store.

33
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.230
Okay.

34
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.750
And back to the store screen.

35
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.360
Okay.

36
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.610
And as you know, the harbor has a property known as background color.

37
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.550
And we're going to say this to whites and we can't longer see this test anymore because you can see

38
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.520
it has a default color of whites.

39
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.090
Okay.

40
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.320
So what we can then do is we can add this tie to this and test STI.

41
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.320
Okay.

42
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.690
First, we could change the color to say colors the black.

43
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.770
And also we can increase the font size to, say, 24.

44
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.730
And now we can get rid of this elevation.

45
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.460
We have to do that.

46
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.690
The harbour has a property known as elevation and we can set it to zero.

47
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.830
And what we can also do is to take this test to the middle.

48
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.780
To do that within the harbour.

49
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.020
It has a property known as ST 82.

50
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.750
And all we just have to say is to set it to true.

51
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.840
Okay.

52
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.350
And now we're going to retrieve our store to do that within the body, within the scaffold.

53
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.250
It has a property known as body.

54
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.570
And for the body, we are just going to go ahead and say string builder.

55
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.790
This time around, we are not going to copy the code, but we are going to write it from scratch.

56
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.140
Distributor And it is also a type of query, query snapshot.

57
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.040
And over here the first property distributor has is a property known as stream.

58
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.240
The stream is basically referring to the source of the data.

59
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.200
Now what we can do is over here, we can create a final variable and we're just going to go ahead and

60
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.920
specify it is a type of firebase faster and we can call this variable on the score faster.

61
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.320
It's going to be equal to Firebase faster dot instance.

62
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.210
Great.

63
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.930
And we can then call that variable on the score faster and we have to assess the collection.

64
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.840
And the name of the collection is called Seller's.

65
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.140
You can see the why.

66
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.810
And what we then have to say is don't get sorry.

67
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.360
We are using a distributor and this is going to be the snapshot.

68
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.930
And remember, the reason we are using this distributor is because we want all our data to display real

69
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.500
time.

70
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.130
If you don't want your data to display every time, you can then use a future beta and instead of snapshots,

71
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.460
iOS is going to be dots gets OC for future reader.

72
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.990
Another property the stream beta has is the beta and the first.

73
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.540
Property is contest and also a property known as async.

74
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.450
A sink.

75
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.060
Snap shut.

76
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.950
Snapshot.

77
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.970
Okay, great.

78
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.640
It is also a type of query.

79
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.550
There is a snap shot.

80
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.130
And now we can call this.

81
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.240
I think you've seen all this before.

82
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.960
We can call this rainbow snap shot.

83
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.700
Great.

84
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.270
Make sure you don't have any spit and the spelling mistake has you.

85
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.480
You're going to get a read on the line in this.

86
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.100
Make sure your spelling is correct.

87
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.150
Okay.

88
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.810
And now what we have to do first is to have a check.

89
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.030
So over here, we can say if.

90
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.030
You Snapchat.

91
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.080
Snapshot.

92
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.710
Snap shots that people buy there.

93
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.090
That has data.

94
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.010
If it has data, then what we want to do is to return.

95
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.370
Is the return a great view.

96
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.200
Great view.

97
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.110
Review two either oc ls oc.

98
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.180
LS.

99
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.330
If it does not have data, we don't really need it.

100
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.040
If this does not run, then this is going to run.

101
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.090
If we do not have data, we want to return a sensor.

102
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.190
A child.

103
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.270
Then a test which is just going to say no stars.

104
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.820
And we need that.

105
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.440
Okay.

106
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.430
Now, the first property of the grid grid view, the beta is the grid delegates.

107
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.580
And this is silver.

108
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.670
I think you see something similar like this silver grid.

109
00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.760
Grilled.

110
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.380
Delegates which fields, crosses, counts.

111
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.490
This is it.

112
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.320
And the first property it has is the cross as camps, which has to do with how many products, sorry,

113
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.950
how many stores we need horizontally for this.

114
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.850
We are going to say we need just two.

115
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.150
That is, we want to have one store.

116
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.480
Right.

117
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.260
And one store.

118
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.710
Right.

119
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.940
Okay.

120
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:32.400
It also has a property known as cross access spacing, which has to do with the space we need horizontally,

121
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.900
that is from left to right, and we can say we need 25 space.

122
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.580
And also it has the main spacing which has to do with the space we need horizontally.

123
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.180
So vertically that is from top to bottom.

124
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:45.950
Okay.

125
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.940
And we can also say 25.

126
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.530
Is contrary and safe.

127
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.650
Sorry, we can't save this file because we have some errors.

128
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.330
And for the better.

129
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:03.800
The bidder will hold a stake in the contest and also the index, which has to do with each item we have.

130
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.720
Okay.

131
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.710
Great.

132
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:15.840
And now we can return a column because basically we are going to have the store image and also the store

133
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.980
name and both of them are going to be displayed vertically.

134
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.630
Okay, children.

135
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.160
And the first side.

136
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.320
So I think we need this most of the time.

137
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.570
We just have to hover to see what you're missing.

138
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.070
Okay.

139
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.130
The first site is going to be a size box or a container.

140
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.059
And the reason for this is we want to give this image a height.

141
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.190
A height and width for the eyes.

142
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.780
We are going to say 120 and for the width it's going to be 120 as well.

143
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.910
And now we can have the child and the child is going to be Image Network.

144
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.640
And you can see they're asking for the source.

145
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.330
For the source.

146
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.160
It's going to be this variable snapshot.

147
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.220
Remember, you can see that variable as a variable that has access to all the details we have in our

148
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.840
cloud store database.

149
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.180
This is going to be snapshot.

150
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.000
These are dot talks and we want to assess each item.

151
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.600
And the name of the item is Image.

152
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:23.620
Or so image, or probably you could have renamed yours to store image.

153
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.200
And over here, we need the north check.

154
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.970
Okay.

155
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.840
And you're trying to cover.

156
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:40.720
And before we see this grid view, the builder has a very important property known as item counts.

157
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.430
For the item counts is going to be snapshot the data the dogs.

158
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.900
The docks and the land.

159
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.830
This is going to give us our meanest store we have.

160
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:54.980
Okay.

161
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.900
Now use control.

162
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.680
And that's to save and hopefully no errors.

163
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.710
If we do not have any store, we then want to return those stores.

164
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.240
Okay.

165
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.700
We have a store, but we do not have.

166
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.880
I think.

167
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.390
Okay, you can see the grades.

168
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.130
One, two, three, four, five.

169
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.730
Right.

170
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.240
Okay.

171
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.110
One, two, two, four, five.

172
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.620
Okay.

173
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.820
One, two, two, four, five, six.

174
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.240
Cool.

175
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.740
Okay.

176
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.260
And now we can add the cover.

177
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:35.300
How they transfer is controlled necessary, and we can then have a test with that.

178
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.100
So get rid of that.

179
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.440
There's going to be snapshot.

180
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.680
The data, the dogs assess each item by their index.

181
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:53.430
And we want to assess the I think we call this what store name.

182
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.280
Store name.

183
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.010
Make sure you don't have any spelling mistake as you're going to get the bastards error.

184
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.690
Okay.

185
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.580
And this this is controlling this to save.

186
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.040
Okay.

187
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.730
Great.

188
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.210
In Kansai this.

189
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.270
STI.

190
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.490
Test.

191
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.980
Okay.

192
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.980
We can increase the font size.

193
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.230
So maybe 22 and fans wait.

194
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.420
Funds, which the board and his friends say.

195
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.460
Okay.

196
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.680
Cisco.

197
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.150
Oh, man.

198
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.940
I think that's way too much.

199
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.790
I think.

200
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.340
Okay.

201
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.810
Okay.

202
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.200
And maybe we could say that to.

203
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.670
Not to.

204
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.930
Uppercase C.

205
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.600
Two uppercase.

206
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.840
The sea is going to look like.

207
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.280
Okay.

208
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.190
So not that they can just get rid of that.

209
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.710
Okay.

210
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.330
Okay.

211
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.910
And this is basically it.

212
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.540
Okay.

213
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.700
And back.

214
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.960
You can just go with that for now.

215
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.350
And what we can also do.

216
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.410
We can wrap this with a container in order to halve the border radius.

217
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:37.240
But if we use a container for this, we have to pass in the declaration box, declaration and so on.

218
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:37.810
Right.

219
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.580
So what we can just do a light and we are going to wrap this with the clip.

220
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.440
Clip.

221
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.340
Rex.

222
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.540
Clip Rex.

223
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.910
I can't speak that properly.

224
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.940
Please give me.

225
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.480
Och!

226
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.070
Och!

227
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.010
Wrecked OC.

228
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.030
Right.

229
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.120
I'm just going to do this one more time clip.

230
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.880
IRA rat.

231
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:02.480
Okay.

232
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.840
And now it has it.

233
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.250
But every year we can then see.

234
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.310
But every year.

235
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:15.570
That's secular and we need 15 others and use control and that's to save.

236
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.440
To give some scope, self scope.

237
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.810
Yeah.

238
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.390
Looking nice.

239
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:27.920
Okay.

240
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.530
Sorry.

241
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.330
And maybe we could also give this test a color to see how it's going to look like.

242
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.720
Most of the time, we just have to test this out.

243
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.940
The design.

244
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.820
Okay.

245
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.840
I don't think this is okay.

246
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.460
Get rid of it.

247
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.350
And this is basically it.

248
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:59.450
Well, most of the time you would want to put your store is going to go with that.

249
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.700
Most of the time, this should not be you bought your store image, right?

250
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:11.630
Because the seller is basically referring to the user who is going to be posting product or the stores.

251
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.850
We are the product is going to be coming from.

252
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:20.720
So most of the time this the store should be the your store logo or.

253
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.980
Or maybe your store --.

254
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.550
That is what you should upload and not you.

255
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.110
Okay.

256
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.890
I think that collar looks weird.

257
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.870
I'm just going to get rid of it, and hopefully you understand everything.

258
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.150
If you don't, you can do to let me know.

259
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.280
I'm fully available to support you.

260
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.110
Okay.

261
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.700
What we are basically doing, we are using a distributor.

262
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:49.140
We could also have used a future beta, but we basically want our data, all our stores to be displayed

263
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.890
real time.

264
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.280
So for this, we have to use a distributor.

265
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:53.850
Right.

266
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.370
Okay.

267
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.740
And it is also a type of query snapshot when dealing with multiple data.

268
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.620
It is referred to as query snapshot.

269
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.800
And over here it has a property known as stream, which is basically referring to the source of the

270
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.420
data.

271
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:14.970
And what we basically did was to create a variable to store the files or Firebase Store database.

272
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:16.390
Right.

273
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:16.700
Okay.

274
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.820
And we want to assess the seller's collection and we are seeing those snapshots.

275
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.480
Right.

276
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.350
Okay.

277
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.230
And it also has the builder property.

278
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:33.510
And the builder will always take in the context and also the async snapshots, which is also a type

279
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.680
of query snapshot.

280
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.620
And the name of the variable is snapshot, this snapshot variable.

281
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.970
You can see it as a container or a box that basically has access to all the data as we have over here.

282
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:45.780
Right.

283
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:52.230
And what we are basically saying is if snapshot that has data, if it has data, then in order to display

284
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:57.510
our products in a very neat manner, we are basically returning a grid view that beta.

285
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:05.250
And the first bit over here is to tell how many stores or how many stores or how many data we have in

286
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.200
the database by saying item counts.

287
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.630
And you can see we are using the snapshot, the data dot, dot, dot length to get how many items we

288
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.230
have.

289
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:20.610
And it also has the grid delegates, which basically refers to how we want to display that item.

290
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:27.120
And you can see why we are having this cross assist count, which has to do with how our data are going

291
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.710
to be displayed horizontally.

292
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:34.560
And you can see why we said to you could also have set theory that is going to be displayed 1 to 3.

293
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.160
Okay.

294
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:42.390
And also it has this cross axis spacing, which has to do with the space we need horizontally, right.

295
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.590
That is from left to right.

296
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.740
It also has this property known as mean as the spacing, which has to do with the space we need vertically

297
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.270
that is from top to bottom.

298
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:59.580
And also it has the property known as item builder, which has to do with how we want to display the

299
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.990
item in general.

300
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.930
And we are basically returning a column.

301
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:11.000
And the reason for this column is because we have an image area and we have it says buy.

302
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.050
Right.

303
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.609
Okay.

304
00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:17.180
And we basically want to display both of those vertically.

305
00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.940
So what we can also do, we can wrap this with the padding.

306
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.520
And you can try and save to give some.

307
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.890
Some stress speaks.

308
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:28.470
Okay.

309
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.590
I think this is okay.

310
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.950
Or we can just go with ten.

311
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.210
And this is basically it's not fully understand why.

312
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.680
If you don't, you can let me know.

313
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.030
Okay, guys, see you at the next lecture.
