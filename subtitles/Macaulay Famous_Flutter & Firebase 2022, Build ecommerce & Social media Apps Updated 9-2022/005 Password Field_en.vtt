00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.589
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.540
Elastic.

4
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:02.900
True.

5
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.250
We created the email field.

6
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
Now this lecture, we're going to create the password field.

7
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.630
Okay.

8
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.860
Now.

9
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.030
This is for the email field.

10
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.460
Right on it is.

11
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.290
Yeah.

12
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.210
So what we're going to do is we're gonna give it a really comma.

13
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.350
Okay.

14
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
Then we're going to have another test field.

15
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.800
Test me out.

16
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.450
Okay.

17
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.320
Now as well.

18
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.070
They're going to have the decoration and the appeals.

19
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.280
Declaration.

20
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.190
Okay.

21
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.070
Now we're going to have the --, which I said the interest is similar to the place or the an extent

22
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.610
though --.

23
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.170
What you can see now is into your password.

24
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.460
Okay.

25
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.550
Either through the collar.

26
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.740
Then you've got your nest to save.

27
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.670
Then go check it out.

28
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.910
Okay.

29
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.810
Now you can see it is very close to issued and now what we can do is we can separate books on two,

30
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.410
separate both going or something called us size books.

31
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.160
Okay.

32
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.290
So over here this is the and then of the first US field, that is for the email.

33
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.480
This is the status of points of the list.

34
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.190
That is for the password.

35
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.730
So what you can do is we can use a size plus at the middle level because there's going to be size books

36
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.300
that are going to be given this space vertically.

37
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.750
Right.

38
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.380
So there's going to be height of probably 50.

39
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.740
Okay.

40
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.140
Control and save.

41
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.590
Okay, great.

42
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.620
Now you can easily just copy and paste it over here.

43
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.650
But for the sake of mastering, I will never do this again.

44
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.100
Okay.

45
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.300
Now as well.

46
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
What we can do is we're going to give a border in all the size.

47
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.760
So to do this, this border, this is going to be up long.

48
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.370
Outline impaired border.

49
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.539
Okay, great.

50
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.590
Is this a safe and good ticket that.

51
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.890
No.

52
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.060
Okay, great.

53
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.850
Now, what we can do is we can look first of all, let's click on this.

54
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.240
Now you're going to see this green collar around the Buddha.

55
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.570
Now, what you can do is you can get rid of the cigarette collar.

56
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.680
Okay.

57
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.460
First of all, I think I have to use the comma in that to get a very good format.

58
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.910
Okay.

59
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.910
Now I got to get rid of this green collar, which again is the MP, the creation of the property known

60
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.470
as full costs.

61
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.030
But that is when you click on it.

62
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.190
So that is what is going to be applied.

63
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.970
Outlined imputes but.

64
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.100
Okay.

65
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.780
Then they're going to set the board aside.

66
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.100
But aside.

67
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.360
Okay, we're just gonna change the color to colors the black.

68
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.850
Okay.

69
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.250
Okay.

70
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.840
AutoTrader.com.

71
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.590
They're trying to control their safe.

72
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.130
It can go check.

73
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.710
It does look like this is gone.

74
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.050
But we better know this is a test field.

75
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:45.170
Now what you can do as well as we tend to impute decoration because the border is to give border at

76
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.130
all sides.

77
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.610
Right.

78
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.180
Right.

79
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.560
So give what other side.

80
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.060
While this focus is one, click on it.

81
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.870
We don't want that screen color.

82
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.480
Okay, now.

83
00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.880
Okay.

84
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.360
Okay.

85
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.350
There you can see we we have this board over there.

86
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.030
Get rid of this board.

87
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.400
That is without clicking on the film.

88
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.570
Okay.

89
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.280
Now, what's in the outline?

90
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.080
If it were there, we can as well as but side.

91
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.510
It is going to be border.

92
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.910
But a side that.

93
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.300
No.

94
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:21.750
Okay.

95
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.880
How do you treat a coma?

96
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.720
Okay.

97
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.000
Great.

98
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.380
Now you can see we can barely see this now because the tip is black.

99
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.160
I will barely know.

100
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.300
This is a test field.

101
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.430
Now, what you can do is we can give this test field a gray color.

102
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.990
Not easily do that.

103
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.350
We tend to impute decoration.

104
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.240
We can just set this field.

105
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.300
Too true.

106
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.620
Okay.

107
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.400
The crew announced to save.

108
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.380
Okay.

109
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.830
Great.

110
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.440
Great.

111
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.050
Okay.

112
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.170
Now, like I said, you can easily just copy this.

113
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.980
Well, this is a similar taste, but for the sake of mustering, most of the time, I've got to do this

114
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.360
from scratch all the time.

115
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.580
Okay.

116
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.820
Probably there are two clothes or you can just sit with here.

117
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.950
Okay.

118
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.460
Great.

119
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.770
Okay, guys, see you in the next section.
