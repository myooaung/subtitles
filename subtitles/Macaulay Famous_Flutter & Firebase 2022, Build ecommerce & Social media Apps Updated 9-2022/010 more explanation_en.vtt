00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.010
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.950
So I feel I needed to emit this video.

4
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.980
Okay, so in this lecture, revenue called this function called fetch bird.

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.730
Okay, well, before then, what we can simply do is in of this, we can just get rid of this and as

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.990
we'll see element.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.440
Darts gets and this is going to be a prize.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.890
Okay.

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.460
And that.

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.600
This is going to be elements.

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.770
Dance.

12
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.370
Gets.

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.840
Quantity aren't.

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.200
Like I've said, you're going to need to make sure what you have is the same thing as what you're going

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.380
to be.

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.490
Pass them to you as you're going to get a busted area.

17
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.610
Okay.

18
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.220
Is this?

19
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.540
Okay, great.

20
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.260
Now, the next thing to do is, is to call this function, and we're just gonna call this function in

21
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.110
the whole file.

22
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.670
So wherever you've had it before, you can just get rid of it.

23
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.990
I think in the last lecture we added it in the feeds products.

24
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.100
I think the fields.

25
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.200
Fields predicts you can just get rid of that.

26
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240
Okay, Glasgow, get rid of these very buses.

27
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.600
You can see we did not we did not actually videos of it.

28
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay.

29
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.390
And as well we called it and fine because it's in the design for each item.

30
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.820
Okay.

31
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.870
So what you can just do is can get rid of that first and.

32
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.390
You can just go directly to the home screen.

33
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.140
And just call it so we don't have duplicate products.

34
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.530
Okay.

35
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.840
So all we can do is we can just copy that.

36
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.540
We have in the fields.

37
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.880
She's for that.

38
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.990
Okay, copy this.

39
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.340
But this is a four dots provider class, right?

40
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.650
Okay.

41
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.460
So you're going to need to have access to that function, which we just created.

42
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.900
Okay.

43
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.639
So we're going to need to go back to the home screen.

44
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.550
And so with ten year in college, you have to impart.

45
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.080
Okay.

46
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.100
And will they?

47
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.930
You can't just simply copy the dribble.

48
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.820
And.

49
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.530
And then the dots had three dots.

50
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.570
That.

51
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:39.430
Thanks, that you can just get rid of this additional doubt and then had your child come out up is not

52
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.900
currently you can see we are fetching from the Eton.

53
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.610
That's right so you're going to need to change us to network image.

54
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.240
So over here.

55
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.930
Okay.

56
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.640
Sorry.

57
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.730
In the cards screen.

58
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.030
Right.

59
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.340
You can see you're going to need to change your eyes to network image and it's going to do that.

60
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.720
Yes, we have assets made.

61
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.020
Right.

62
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.950
So you can see.

63
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.450
Let's walk.

64
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.180
Image.

65
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.550
Okay.

66
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.500
Right.

67
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.860
Okay.

68
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.890
As well.

69
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.580
You will need to do that for the detail page.

70
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.150
Over a year ago I need to say network work.

71
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.410
Right.

72
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.770
Okay.

73
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.300
And.

74
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.140
Of here.

75
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.490
We're going to get rid of this.

76
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.540
Sorry for that.

77
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.770
Okay.

78
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.490
And.

79
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.600
The cats are tame as well.

80
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.340
You're going to see network image.

81
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.520
Right, because currently we are not searching from the Internet.

82
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.920
Okay.

83
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.770
And as well, the fields they have designed for each products because they need to say network.

84
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.990
Image rights.

85
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.600
Okay.

86
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.270
I think look over here.

87
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.750
You're going to need to see network image.

88
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.380
You're to change from that set to the image.

89
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.720
Okay.

90
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.950
And.

91
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.120
Over your face with us everywhere.

92
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.910
We are using the assets of good if the changes to the network image.

93
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.920
Okay, now let's use contra.

94
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.820
So let's restart in order to save those unsaved files.

95
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.430
And.

96
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.529
Okay.

97
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.890
Okay.

98
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.279
Okay.

99
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.640
Okay.

100
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.029
Okay.

101
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.450
Okay.

102
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.760
Okay.

103
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.060
Now, for the now, as you can see, we just have the two products which we have in the database.

104
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.710
Now, what you're going to look for is the right phi to call all this.

105
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.080
You can see currently it is only available in the screen.

106
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.290
We need to go to the screen before it's going to be available in the home screen.

107
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.220
So what we need to do is to look for it.

108
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.750
Now you can see.

109
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.660
It is.

110
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.820
I didn't walk her down to eat a cake and see.

111
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.010
Okay.

112
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.490
So in this lecture, we're going to solve this error.

113
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.510
Okay, I got this again.

114
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.270
You're going to see he's going to duplicate it again.

115
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.020
Okay.

116
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.020
So in this lecture, which is going to solve this error.

117
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.150
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
