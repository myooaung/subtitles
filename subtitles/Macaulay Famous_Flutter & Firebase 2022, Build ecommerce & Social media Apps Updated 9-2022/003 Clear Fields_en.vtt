00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.410
Now, after creating an account where they're just going to leave the value letters, both of them are

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.740
okay not to do this.

5
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.940
I'm going to go back to our PSA code.

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.900
Okay.

7
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.940
Now over the submit button.

8
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.800
This is the register button.

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.230
What we can do is.

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.480
Instead of having justice, we can use a function so we can accommodate orders.

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.090
Okay, so the first thing is the kind of user.

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.010
Okay, great.

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.100
Now we don't want to trigger this function, but as well we want a clear.

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.700
Or does it use so that the cloud is fields?

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.360
All we have to do is just the full name.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.890
Sorry.

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.330
A tape recorder on the school phone.

18
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.500
Then Control start.

19
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.320
Claire Okay, so this was the Claire Danes codename where they're going to do it for the user name.

20
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.300
Until they're what?

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.230
Claire.

22
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.040
Then also on the score.

23
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.480
I think we call this email cultural dot world.

24
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.180
Claire Okay.

25
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.060
This is going to be as well on this call password.

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.850
Popular thought.

27
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.700
Okay, good.

28
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.960
Natalie's contribution is to save this.

29
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.710
Okay.

30
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.400
Now you're going to try to click on this stuff.

31
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.630
Okay, great.

32
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.280
Now you can see all the shows.

33
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.640
Our.

34
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.690
Click.

35
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.460
So not a dispute.

36
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.470
But the values are the values.

37
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.420
What's clear out of this feels like, regardless, an account has been created for you.

38
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.280
Okay.

39
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.850
That is the.

40
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.570
Right.

41
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.520
So we said if it is not a it is sources that resembles be an error on the water it's on the arrow health

42
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.060
we want to say congratulations account as and create that so I think accounts are created a kickoff

43
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.250
on this by going to either our player base or the block or search cause they also change in the in the

44
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.670
house.

45
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.080
Okay.

46
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.800
Good.

47
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.920
Okay.

48
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.180
