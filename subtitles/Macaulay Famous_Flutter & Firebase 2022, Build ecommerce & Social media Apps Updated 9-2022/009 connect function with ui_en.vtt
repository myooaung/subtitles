00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.040
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.470
Work.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.330
In this lecture, we're going to connect this function with our UI.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.810
Okay?

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.390
But before that, all we can do is email the user, finish uploading the video.

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.830
Then we're gonna need to take that user to the previous screen.

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.220
Okay.

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
To do that over here, we have to call the get then.

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.900
So we need to highlight and then use Katrina dots.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.170
Okay.

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.680
We're going to import it from this get slash, get to that.

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.220
And then that's my process to lots of gets properties.

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.270
Okay.

14
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
And now we can see dots back.

15
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.580
Okay.

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.420
So after the video finish, uploading is going to take us back to the previous routes.

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.810
Okay.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.550
Now where we can then catch the error by using the gets dots.

19
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.090
Shoes.

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.590
Sorry, snack bar in order to show the error to the user.

21
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.520
Okay.

22
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.940
For you.

23
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.940
For the title we can see here.

24
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.760
Here are.

25
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.930
Upload in.

26
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.870
Video.

27
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.860
Okay.

28
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
So this this is what is going to be shown to the user.

29
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.090
And over here, we can convert it to a string, basically that says string.

30
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.410
That is error.

31
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.730
That's a string.

32
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.060
Okay.

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.130
This is basically it.

34
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.580
Okay.

35
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.740
So now we can then connect disfunction called upload video to our UI.

36
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.450
So to do this we need to go to.

37
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.890
I think the.

38
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.320
Confirm screen and.

39
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.230
This.

40
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.030
Right.

41
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.420
Okay.

42
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.370
That's all we have to share.

43
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.160
But then well, before then, you know, to have access to that function, we first need to have access

44
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.760
to that.

45
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.500
Upload controller class.

46
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.850
Okay.

47
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.450
Over here.

48
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.660
We can create a finer and.

49
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.030
We can just do this.

50
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.750
We can just do this over here.

51
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.830
Okay.

52
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.510
We can't create a final viable.

53
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.140
Right.

54
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.930
And.

55
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.510
We can then call this.

56
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.290
So I think upload video controller and on the score upload video controller and now you can see gets.

57
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.830
That's put I think you've seen this before.

58
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.100
Okay.

59
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:39.100
So we were at Sony to a light and yes Coltrane dots in part from the gets kids and let's put.

60
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.590
And now we can the upload.

61
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.220
Upload video, upload it.

62
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.080
Upload a video controller.

63
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.650
Yeah.

64
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.640
Okay.

65
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.510
Great.

66
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.410
Okay.

67
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.680
Now, you can see we have this test field that is the song in test field as well, the capture nine

68
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.060
and that to have access to the value the user is going to type in, we need to create a controller for

69
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.440
that.

70
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.870
Okay.

71
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.180
So we can just do this over here.

72
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.850
We can create a finer.

73
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.020
And we can just go ahead and specify the type is this type of test.

74
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.100
It is the controller and is going to be on this car song name.

75
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.510
Controller, it's going to be required to test.

76
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.840
Editing controller.

77
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.630
As well.

78
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.930
Fina a.

79
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.210
Editing controller for the score.

80
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.820
This is going to be a culture controller.

81
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.490
It is a court to test it.

82
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.570
It's in controller.

83
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.040
Okay.

84
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.120
Great.

85
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.220
So over this song name.

86
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.660
Okay.

87
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.750
The test field as a property known as controller.

88
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.970
And then we can call the song name controller.

89
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.830
So by doing this, we're going to have access to the value.

90
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.400
This is going to type mean and as well controller this could capture.

91
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.770
Controller.

92
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.670
Okay.

93
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.029
And all what is.

94
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.390
Sure, but then we can then score the other score.

95
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.060
Upload control available we have.

96
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.090
Then we can then assess the upload video.

97
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.530
Akiko is asking for the song name and for the song name.

98
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.840
It is going to be underscore song name controller.

99
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.320
To assess the value, we need to say dot test and as well it is going to be able to capture.

100
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.990
Controller, Dan, to assess the value we need to set our test.

101
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.760
Okay.

102
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.490
For the parts of the video, you can see where they have a variable value, but this is a top level

103
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.840
variable.

104
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.920
Okay.

105
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.740
So you can see the parts of the video.

106
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.660
That is the parts of the video.

107
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.440
It is its top level variables to assess.

108
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.340
It's what we have to do is to say widgets.

109
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.440
Darts video part.

110
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.990
Okay, this is basically it.

111
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.900
Okay, now you can hardly start and.

112
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.400
Okay.

113
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.800
I think my harp is not running then.

114
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.930
You can then run.

115
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.550
Okay.

116
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.330
Then you can just ride this out yourself while I wait for this to finish.

117
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.620
You didn't want to see any mistakes.

118
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.790
Okay, so try this.

119
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.950
Your step is going to take some time.

120
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.710
Then once it's finished, uploading.

121
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.500
It's going to take you to the previous roots.

122
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.360
You can see that's what we're doing over here.

123
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.490
That's what we do in the valley.

124
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.040
We said, was it as fish uploaded?

125
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.350
Right.

126
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.290
Once that's finished uploading to the video's collection, once the video finish uploading to the videos

127
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.770
collection, we then want to go back to the previous page.

128
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.460
And if there's an error that we want submitted to the user, which is just going to say error uploaded

129
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.600
video.

130
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.910
Okay.

131
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.240
It is basically it's guys.

132
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.170
Okay, guys, see you in a six year.

133
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.210
But before then you can just tell us this about yourself.

134
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.390
Click on the share, upload video, capture how this song name and shape, then go check your for your

135
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.580
class press or database.
