00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.880
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.980
Walker In this section, we're going to start working on the others.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.370
Okay?

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.040
Now, the first step we're going to need to take is we are going to create the fields we need for the

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.430
other.

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.600
Okay, not to do this over this mothers directory.

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.210
We're going to need to create a new file and we're going to call this file order.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.460
On this score attributes we can just use the 80 arrow as a shot from and the section is thoughts that

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.780
okay.

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.330
Right.

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.490
Just going to get rid of this.

12
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.910
Okay.

13
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.210
Now we're going to create a class where we can just use control and be class as well.

14
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.250
We're gonna need to call this order.

15
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.700
It's Arrow.

16
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.280
Right.

17
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.680
Okay.

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.770
Now as well, we're going to say with.

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.580
Change.

20
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.830
No to.

21
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.900
No tears fire.

22
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.800
And as in all this, you can listen for changes we are making to the order.

23
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.440
I could get rid of this.

24
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.810
Okay.

25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.330
Okay.

26
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.340
Now we are going to create the fields.

27
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.150
Okay, fine.

28
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.250
The fields.

29
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.070
Fields.

30
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.480
The first field we need is going to be the product or the ID.

31
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.000
So we can just call this or the ID and it's going to be a test.

32
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.270
So it's going to be a desert type of string.

33
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.020
And this cycle of need is.

34
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.030
Foreigner.

35
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.510
The user ID that is the user holder in your product.

36
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.640
Okay.

37
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.940
And as well, we need the product ID.

38
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.560
But I'd.

39
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.690
And as well.

40
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.500
We need the okay.

41
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.340
It's going to be a test the tie to of the product.

42
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.500
Find the string.

43
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.130
We need the price of the products.

44
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.080
Find.

45
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.580
Image.

46
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.180
You're.

47
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.740
Oh.

48
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.190
The image to put up.

49
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.560
Right.

50
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.940
Okay.

51
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.420
As well.

52
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.630
String.

53
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.510
Okay.

54
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.520
We also didn't do need to.

55
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.920
Quantity of the product that is our many products the user is ordering.

56
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.370
Okay.

57
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.680
Or.

58
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.500
Chichi.

59
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.320
Okay.

60
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.400
And finally, we can add the date.

61
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.440
The product was order so we can see order dates.

62
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.520
Or the date.

63
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.260
This going to be a type of something known as tine.

64
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.380
Time.

65
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.180
It's time.

66
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.860
Okay, great.

67
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.500
Now, that's a fair title.

68
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.570
In order to easily refer to all this fields, we need to pass E to the constructor.

69
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.790
So whenever we call this class, we're going to pass the value to all this fields.

70
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.090
Right.

71
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.430
Okay.

72
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:28.210
So to do that, we just have to do first is to use controller allied first and then use control and

73
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.570
dots.

74
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.570
Then you can see create constructor for final fields.

75
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.950
Okay.

76
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.030
And at this.

77
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.140
Now over here, you're going to need to hide this and this.

78
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.490
Okay, so this.

79
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.290
Okay.

80
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.760
Now, what you can do is you can make this not required.

81
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.370
So any time we call this class, we don't really need to pass in all these fields, but we're going

82
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.360
to make this required.

83
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.800
Okay.

84
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.000
So I think this.

85
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.020
Okay.

86
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.020
So to make it required layer, you can just say required.

87
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.150
You can see that here is gone to make it not required.

88
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.450
You can just see over here the question mark.

89
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.610
This means it can be no.

90
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.120
Okay.

91
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.200
So you can see the arrows, God boards whenever we call this.

92
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.350
Odor attributes, we want to be able to pass the value to it.

93
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.520
So once you can just do.

94
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.350
Or we must positive value to it.

95
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.740
Okay.

96
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.840
So I think this.

97
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.970
Get rid of this.

98
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.080
And so this.

99
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.000
And required.

100
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.810
As well require this.

101
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.830
So any time acquired this value it was we must pass in the value to that's available.

102
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.060
These are babies, right?

103
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.620
You can refer to them as fields.

104
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.540
For now, they have no value or one of the attributes of class.

105
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.740
They're going to be able to pass along the value to those variables.

106
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.590
All fields.

107
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.100
Okay.

108
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.590
Required and.

109
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.610
Required as well.

110
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.900
And as well required.

111
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.220
And as well require.

112
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.350
Okay, Grace, each country you're a to save.

113
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.660
Okay.

114
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.360
You can see.

115
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.740
Gave us a very good format.

116
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.030
Sorry.

117
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.890
We're only going to have to call my.

118
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.930
And.

119
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.560
Okay.

120
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.970
Sorry.

121
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.080
Okay.

122
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.710
Great.

123
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.510
Okay.

124
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.240
These are the fields we need for the order.

125
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.620
You can add more if you weren't.

126
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.680
Okay.

127
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.940
We need to order the product.

128
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.290
Order ID the that we are going to be able to track orders.

129
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.580
Okay.

130
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.270
Something like that.

131
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.640
Okay.

132
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.590
We need the user ID.

133
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.950
That is the user ordering the product and the product ID the title of the product.

134
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.270
That is the name of the product.

135
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.910
So we are going to know which product to sell to send for the user.

136
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.350
They also need to know the price of the product's user wants watches and the imagery hell attached to

137
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.940
that product.

138
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.220
Right?

139
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.590
So we are going to need to know the product and are going to put out the user wants.

140
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.070
Okay.

141
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.660
And as well, we're going to keep track of the date the user made that order.

142
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.100
Okay.

143
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.330
And over here, in order to be able to easily refer to all this fields, we needed to pass it on to

144
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.630
the constructor and we made it required.

145
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.520
So any time we call this order attribute, then it's going to be a must pass in the value to all this.

146
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.480
As you can just avoid it by another question mark.

147
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.440
Why?

148
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.010
Which means the fields can be empty.

149
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.570
Okay.

150
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.590
You're going to need to get rid of that if you want to add a question mark.

151
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.970
Okay.

152
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.500
Okay.

153
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.500
This basically is.

154
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.650
And over here, where is the change or so far?

155
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.140
So, at least in the change we are making to the order.

156
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.650
Okay.

157
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.350
Okay, guys.

158
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.560
See you in the next lecture.
