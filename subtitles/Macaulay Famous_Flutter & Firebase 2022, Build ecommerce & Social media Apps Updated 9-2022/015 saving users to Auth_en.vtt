00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.560
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:10.380
Now, in the last lecture, we created this function which we called register user, and we pass, and

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.990
the user name will pass and it will pass and the password pass the image.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.060
The reason for this was we want to set up validation for users creating accounts.

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.240
So we said if the username is not empty, that it is not empty.

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.900
If the image is not empty, if the password is not empty, then if the image is not equal to the which

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.700
means if it is not empty as well, then we want to.

9
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.990
Save the user to the heart.

10
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.420
Okay.

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.850
And also want to save the user to the fire vs faster.

12
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.570
Okay.

13
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.580
So now what you can do.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.270
First I'm going to save the user to the hearts.

15
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.280
So not to do that, they're going to use that package which we wish we installed.

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.300
Okay.

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.250
I just think these are too big too, so we don't get multi-line comments.

18
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.310
So this is going to be five base art ways of using this five ways or it's what we can do.

19
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.220
We can create if able to store this in our costs, but that's fine.

20
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.220
So over here, I'm just going to have a comment that this is colors.

21
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.970
Okay then over there they're going to see five is.

22
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.750
Okay.

23
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.030
You're going to see fire.

24
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.060
This.

25
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.570
Okay, great.

26
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.650
Now what you can do, we can create a variable.

27
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.130
We can call this fire, this wave of fire.

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.680
This.

29
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.430
Or it's.

30
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.220
Okay.

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.330
There's going to score.

32
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.930
So this should be a fire service or it is going to store that fire base.

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.890
Fabrice.

34
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.789
So this is going to be Fabrice or it does is tense.

35
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.810
Okay great.

36
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.250
To say.

37
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.040
Okay.

38
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.590
So now we're going to go back to the horse controller.

39
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.870
So over here, what you just have to do is.

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.280
The way we create a wish record for our base, but they're going to see dots create user with email

41
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.090
and password.

42
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.540
Now the user name and the image field is just an additional field, right?

43
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.070
What is not going to get created or added to the hearts?

44
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:52.850
Okay, so they're going to hide this or have written to the families first or for the.

45
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.470
But for the Himba we had everything to describe this fast.

46
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.890
Alright.

47
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.110
What had the user name and the image to the heart?

48
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.970
So now what they're going to do next, they're going to go to our Firebase console.

49
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.810
They're going to go to the whole screen.

50
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.610
I'm just going to open this menu tab.

51
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.670
Hopefully my network.

52
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.900
The camera is going to check.

53
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.790
Just have to wait a while.

54
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.230
Okay.

55
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.410
Sorry, love, even bad network.

56
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.900
Okay.

57
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.310
Okay.

58
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.220
Now we're going to click on Get Started.

59
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.770
It started.

60
00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:03.310
So what you are trying to do is to enable the log in so we create an account using the email and password.

61
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.380
Okay.

62
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.240
So now okay, now we're going to go to the email password.

63
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.030
Now we are going to enable dates.

64
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.120
So now we're going to click on Save.

65
00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.290
Okay, great.

66
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.800
So now when we.

67
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:33.870
Create an account, the email and the password is going to be saved in the hard that is this user ID

68
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.970
of a body user by the user name on the image.

69
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.200
It's not going to be stored here.

70
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.120
What it is is going to be stored at the class store.

71
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.750
Okay.

72
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.250
So now I'm going to call again.

73
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.590
I think we just have to had this semicolon.

74
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.080
I.

75
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.200
Now in the last lecture, first of all.

76
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.550
We created a function called so that we created a function called registered user.

77
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.460
And the reason for this was so we actually had validation checks for users creating an account.

78
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.620
So we said.

79
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.200
We passed for us the username I will say the data type of string.

80
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.180
This was in the email we solicited that type of string we passed in the password.

81
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.490
We said it is a type of string we pass in the image.

82
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.970
We are as well said Is it it?

83
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.710
That's it.

84
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.300
We said, is it?

85
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.170
It's a type of fly.

86
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.540
Okay.

87
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.110
Now, over here we created to try and catch.

88
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.330
BLOCK.

89
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:55.670
Then over the try we said if the username is not empty and the email is not empty and the password is

90
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.390
not empty.

91
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.920
The image is not equal to null, which is kind of is not empty as well.

92
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.850
Then if orders are not empty.

93
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:14.170
Then we want to save the user to the art and to fab as fast or or for the now we are just saving the

94
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.680
user.

95
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.100
The email, the password to the.

96
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.830
Hot.

97
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.560
That is over here.

98
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.460
Okay.

99
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.560
Right.

100
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.030
Then if probably the user gods or any hearer when creating an account.

101
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.090
Then we're going to go.

102
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.650
It's on the Herald.

103
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:48.460
So we used to get the snap, but then we had the title of The Hero, which is going to be a hero creating

104
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.910
accounts.

105
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.060
Then we said he does a string, which is going to be the the message or the the the hero.

106
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.870
These are good.

107
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.130
Okay, great.

108
00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.610
Like as we said.

109
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:10.260
Have these or don't have any fields to store the use and they really have the create user with email

110
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.600
a password so.

111
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.310
For the user name and for the image.

112
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.440
You're going to store that in the.

113
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.750
Five is faster and faster than the story written again in the fab is faster, but without this toilet.

114
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:35.710
Sorry the user name so well story the password and email on the fly wizards.

115
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.010
Hopefully you understand it's another year.

116
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:48.310
We created the Firebase hard variable, which you said is equal to the five days of instance.

117
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.210
So over here, I guess using the variable which we had earlier created.

118
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.170
Okay.

119
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.520
I fully understand is why if you don't do the studies, it's fine.

120
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.700
As the process goes.

121
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.080
Shirley, you're going to get everything, okay?

122
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.520
Okay, guys.

123
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.810
In a nice lecture, we are going to save the user to the Firebase First Store.

124
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.170
Lucky as seen in this lecture.
