00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.990
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.390
Worker Now, since we are no longer using the products coming from this clause, what we're going to

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.530
do is be able to do so.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.029
Clean up.

5
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:08.460
Okay.

6
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.320
Now, first of all.

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400
They're going to go to this all products, right.

8
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.840
And I'm going to lose control.

9
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.620
And bits of this white are going to need to get rid of this rice since it's no longer needed.

10
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.020
And for sure you're going to have this error because we made that field required.

11
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.650
So what you're going to do is we're going to go to the designs for each products.

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.340
I think we call this PHI products.

13
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.510
Right.

14
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.840
Okay.

15
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.770
Now, what we're going to do is we can make this not required by this question mark, which means this

16
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.940
course can be not.

17
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.630
Okay.

18
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.160
Now, go back to your.

19
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.750
All products you can see it is no longer required.

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.410
Okay.

21
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.150
Was this one of these?

22
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.320
And that's what we're just going to do is we can get rid of this clothes entirely.

23
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.100
Okay.

24
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.390
And remove this as well.

25
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.640
Dan and we'll click on this or take me to the hero.

26
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.290
They're just going to cut this up.

27
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.890
Okay.

28
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.820
Get rid of this.

29
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.430
Okay, great.

30
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.350
Now you can try and save.

31
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.310
Okay, then.

32
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.890
We're going to go back to the oil products now instead of using this closed lease, the land.

33
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.090
They're going to be using the products model data.

34
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.210
Right.

35
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.590
Okay.

36
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.360
So what they're going to do is they're going to go back to the design for each product.

37
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.950
And now Lebanon needs a copy of this.

38
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.010
Now, I know you might be wondering, why did we not create this variable or that?

39
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.840
Why are we doing it?

40
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.810
We changed the widgets.

41
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.940
Now we are doing this because we want to be able to easily have access to this context.

42
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.340
If we should create is available via.

43
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.070
You can see we are not going to have access to this contest.

44
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.720
So now that to save our stress we, we needed to create the variable within the widgets.

45
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.050
So we also have access to this contest.

46
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.360
Right.

47
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.690
Okay.

48
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.900
So now we're going to go back to the all products.

49
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.010
Then over here, it's a past.

50
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.910
It's then you can see we have access to the contents because it's all there.

51
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.310
And now we can use control and dots.

52
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.250
Now that's pots.

53
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.550
And what's this?

54
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.120
Okay.

55
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.760
Great.

56
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.950
As well.

57
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.450
The part, the product model.

58
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.230
Okay.

59
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.600
Now, is it all this close?

60
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.770
These documents.

61
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.930
Is going to be on the score products.

62
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.570
This.

63
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.590
That list is to save.

64
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.780
Okay.

65
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.550
Who are you listening to?

66
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.520
Satisfy his friends to save.

67
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.090
Okay.

68
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.290
Go check it out.

69
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.940
Okay, great.

70
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.980
Now we are using the products coming from the products model.

71
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.780
See.

72
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.910
Okay.

73
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.170
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
