00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.589
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.160
Now, before we start pitching products, we're going to first needs to sort out this new IV section.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
So whenever we click on any of this products, it's also going to take us to the detail page of that

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.750
product.

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.430
Okay, not to do this, we're gonna need to go back to our visa code and then the design for each product.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.770
Okay.

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.300
Okay.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080
And now we can then use control and the Internet to move this wide.

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.970
Now, instead of using our provider data, we can then use the models, products, models, data.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.520
Okay.

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.160
That is it over here.

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.750
Okay.

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.550
Now, to do this, we are going to go back to the design for each product.

15
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.010
Okay.

16
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.540
Okay.

17
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.010
Now we can then use control and be okay.

18
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.340
And then we can import.

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.630
It's over here.

20
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.370
We're going to create a variable.

21
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.660
It's going to be fine available.

22
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.670
And we can call this produce is going to be equal to the provider.

23
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.210
The lots of contest.

24
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.290
Okay.

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.170
Then they're going to call that product model.

26
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.090
Products.

27
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.840
Okay, great.

28
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.270
Now, the next thing to do is to use it.

29
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.200
Okay.

30
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.220
Instead of this, you're going to get rid of this.

31
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.930
And there's going to be products.

32
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
That's Image Jarrell.

33
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.440
Okay.

34
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.650
Okay.

35
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.760
Instead of this, we're going to need to get rid of this is going to be products that's.

36
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.690
Time to.

37
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.800
How do you to cover?

38
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.870
Okay.

39
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.130
Get rid.

40
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.700
Get rid of this.

41
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.370
There's going to be products.

42
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.970
That.

43
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.530
I think price.

44
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.990
Okay.

45
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.930
Okay.

46
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.700
I think that we are our hearts are stages.

47
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.860
Okay.

48
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.020
You start out.

49
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.530
We start.

50
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.400
All three start.

51
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.890
Okay.

52
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.120
It is going to take some time.

53
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.860
To restart.

54
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.780
Okay.

55
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.400
Okay.

56
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.790
Okay.

57
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.180
Okay.

58
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.570
Okay.

59
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.960
Okay.

60
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.710
Okay, okay.

61
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.460
Okay, okay.

62
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.950
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

63
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.370
Okay.

64
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.210
Is done.

65
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.630
Okay.

66
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.200
I'll start out the this out before this.

67
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.000
Okay.

68
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.900
I have an error.

69
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.210
Right.

70
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.110
Okay, so you know what this is, right?

71
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.560
You've seen this before, right?

72
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.920
Okay.

73
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.760
Now we're going to go to the our products, right?

74
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.210
Okay.

75
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.350
Controller and B and I are going to need to wrap this with.

76
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.530
Something known as change.

77
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.010
No.

78
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.880
It's a fire.

79
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.290
Not to fire provider that value.

80
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.460
Where we can then see value.

81
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.790
Okay.

82
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.220
The value is going to be the forgiveness.

83
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.520
And then in dance.

84
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.160
Right.

85
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.350
You know what this is.

86
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.830
Okay.

87
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.750
Now, how to start this now?

88
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.070
Hopefully you have you've forgotten this, right?

89
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.300
You can just go back to the lecture.

90
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.550
Most of the time, you definitely forget, but you have to repeat it constantly.

91
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.910
Right.

92
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.710
In order for you to, you must understand all processes.

93
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.130
Okay?

94
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.750
Now.

95
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.140
This is going to show the product now.

96
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.920
Okay, great.

97
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.690
Now, what you're going to do on this is when we click on this products, we want you to take us to

98
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.440
the detail page.

99
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.710
Right.

100
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.040
Okay.

101
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.790
So now we're going to go back to design for each product.

102
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.880
Okay.

103
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.210
Now we already have the in the gesture detector.

104
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.180
If for any reason you don't have it, you can just tap on this and wrap it with a gesture detector.

105
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.570
Okay.

106
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.810
Now I'm going to say navigator.

107
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.780
The crux of contests.

108
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.220
Dots.

109
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.910
Remember when it is better to be in them roots, right?

110
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.400
So there is going to be push name.

111
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.850
Okay.

112
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.830
I'm going to be using the fields.

113
00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.910
I think.

114
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.440
The fields.

115
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.260
Okay.

116
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.310
What we can just do is, first of all, we can go to.

117
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.320
Did you tell Page?

118
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.150
Right.

119
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.540
The editor page.

120
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.370
Okay.

121
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.790
Sorry.

122
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.930
But.

123
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.780
Okay.

124
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.020
Go back to this.

125
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.830
There's going to be a detail.

126
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.500
Page.

127
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.600
That's it.

128
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.040
Okay, that's it.

129
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.750
I'd be sorry.

130
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.900
I'd.

131
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.580
Right.

132
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.890
So we're going to see arguments and parts and the products.

133
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.820
That's IDI.

134
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.610
Okay.

135
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.320
Now where we we are busy over here.

136
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.410
We are basically passing that products right by these products.

137
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.850
What is productive is just a variable that have access to all our products.

138
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.800
Model that is all this data, right.

139
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.870
And then we are saying when the user clicks on this, it will pass it to the page.

140
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.630
Now what the detail page we already have.

141
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.260
It's when we did it for the fields screen.

142
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.680
Right.

143
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.260
We have already done that before.

144
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.870
Over here we are saying product ID.

145
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.700
Is equal to model roots.

146
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.780
That, of course, is the cities that we have in assess that arguments we just passed right then as

147
00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.960
well.

148
00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.620
We are covaxin.

149
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.490
It is drink.

150
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.990
Right.

151
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.770
So we have already accepted that data.

152
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.180
Okay.

153
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.860
Now seems good, right?

154
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.490
Okay.

155
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.820
Knife for any reason.

156
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.540
You don't understand.

157
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.340
You can let me know, right?

158
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.910
You can, then.

159
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:21.030
I mean, I'm going to try my best that to make sure you understand bits of everything we are doing.

160
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.140
But mind you.

161
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.280
You might definitely forget all this, but most of the time you would want to go back to it over and

162
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.260
over again in order for you to understand all the codes and as well my study codes.

163
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.930
So you're going to be able to do it on your own.

164
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.410
Okay.

165
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.870
Okay, guys, sitting in that chair.
