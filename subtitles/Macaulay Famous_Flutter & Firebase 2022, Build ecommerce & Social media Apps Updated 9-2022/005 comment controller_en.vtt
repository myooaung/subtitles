00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.660
In this lecture, we're going to create the comments controller.

4
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.620
Okay, then.

5
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.470
Enough to do this.

6
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.390
We need to go to the controller tree.

7
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.390
And over here we're going to need to create a new file.

8
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.290
And you're going to call this fi comment on this car controller and then a section dot dot.

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.260
Okay.

10
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.830
And now we can use controller and beats to make this right.

11
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.340
Okay.

12
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.890
Now the first step is to create a class and as well we can call this comments.

13
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.190
Controller, Kyle Schroeder.

14
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.540
Sorry class.

15
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.040
Okay.

16
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.680
Climate controller and this.

17
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.830
And over here we need to extend from get s controller.

18
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.470
Okay.

19
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.810
Now, what we can do is we can get rid of all this and leave this in the that's automatically in parts

20
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.940
everything from the get.

21
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.120
We can just get rid of this and layer a light and use controlling dots, then import from this.

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.770
Okay.

23
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.970
Great.

24
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.600
Now the first step is to create what we are.

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.620
We are basically creating a function in order to paste comment.

26
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.010
Right.

27
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.430
Okay.

28
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.440
So that the first thing to do is to see our has to know what this does and it can then specify is going

29
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.070
to be a list.

30
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.480
A list of.

31
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.850
Comment.

32
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.070
That is the comment model.

33
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.320
Climate model is popping up.

34
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.130
Okay.

35
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.760
Comment.

36
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.980
I think we called it comment.

37
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.280
Right.

38
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.790
Okay.

39
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.010
And so this.

40
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.340
And.

41
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.940
So I think we need to get rid of that.

42
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.220
And over here, when you try light and use controlling dots in part this.

43
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.730
Okay.

44
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.490
And now we need to see all this comment that is going to be equal to.

45
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.060
This again.

46
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.040
So there's going to be Harris.

47
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.750
Right.

48
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.250
Okay.

49
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.590
And it's going to be quoted this.

50
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.520
And we can make this empty for now.

51
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.330
That is, we do not have any comments.

52
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.790
So by making this.

53
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.270
Okay, great.

54
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.460
Now, this is similar to.

55
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.190
The upload, right?

56
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.210
Because currently we are just trying to do to upload a comment.

57
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.340
Right, or to post a comment.

58
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.840
Rice is definitely going to be similar to.

59
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.420
Ta ta, ta.

60
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.470
Where do we have the.

61
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.810
I think of our year.

62
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.260
Okay, this is basically what we're doing.

63
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.510
So you can basically copy and paste this over here.

64
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.550
You can just basically copy this.

65
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.690
And here's this in case you're tired of typing.

66
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.300
And this is going to be the comment model.

67
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.110
Comments and we can visibly copy this and his this.

68
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.270
Okay, great.

69
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.460
Okay, great.

70
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.930
Now, the first thing to do is to create the hide for the product, get this string, and for the now

71
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.130
we can just say post.

72
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.940
So in other products, I think we should do it sticks out.

73
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.290
Right.

74
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.510
Okay.

75
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.010
So this is going to be creates in the hide for the comments.

76
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.240
Okay.

77
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.200
So over here, we can't just leave this empty for now.

78
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.920
And now what we have to do is to.

79
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.260
Create a function.

80
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.970
It's a creative function.

81
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.160
We can call this post comment.

82
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.270
And the field we basically need is the comment test, right?

83
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.760
Once again access to other users commenting and we can require that specify it is a data type of string.

84
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.450
And over here you can then have it.

85
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.750
Try the cast block.

86
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.150
I think you've seen all this before.

87
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.680
Try to catch it.

88
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.829
And yet we can see.

89
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.320
So.

90
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.579
I think I just have to redo this.

91
00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.079
Okay.

92
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.570
Sorry.

93
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.180
Try.

94
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.700
Try and.

95
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.300
Try and.

96
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.730
Try and catch.

97
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.130
Okay.

98
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.260
And all you will need to have a life sitting at first and to say if comments test.

99
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.740
That is not.

100
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.440
Empty.

101
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.530
Then want to do something crazy.

102
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.160
Okay.

103
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.300
Okay.

104
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.090
First of all, what we have to do is to get the current logged in user or to get the user who is currently

105
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.680
posting that comment.

106
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.680
To do that, you're going to use this which you've seen before.

107
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:08.990
We can just go ahead and specify it is a type of document snapshot and now we can call this.

108
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.700
You can basically call this user doc or user data or whatever you want to call it.

109
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.640
And now we can see how it's delivering that.

110
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.000
That's the use the weight we need to have the async over here.

111
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.880
I think and we need this.

112
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.430
We can get rid of this weight and this.

113
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.420
It's going to be what's.

114
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.500
Firebase.

115
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.180
I think your record is higher.

116
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.440
Store does collection and users rights and.

117
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.040
And.

118
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.570
Darts, Doc.

119
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.200
Okay.

120
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.460
This is going to be hard.

121
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.690
But controller.

122
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.860
I'd control our thoughts, words, thoughts, user thoughts.

123
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.180
This is going to be what you did in order to get the comment logged in user oh just how to say is that

124
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.360
get okay over here we have to have a not check and this.

125
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.650
Okay great.

126
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.820
Now this we've currently gets got in the current logged in user is currently making that comment and

127
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.760
now all we can then do it as well.

128
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.770
We can get the length of the comments, that is how many comments we have.

129
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.270
So currently we have not uploaded any comment, but we can just go ahead and get that.

130
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.290
Okay.

131
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:42.650
Now to do this, all we just have to say is we're going to need to create an order we can just create

132
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.550
on that variable.

133
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.080
We can call this or docs.

134
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.300
It's going to be or docs.

135
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.200
That is all our ideas are and we need to say Firebase so faster.

136
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.930
Passed or Dot's collection.

137
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.160
Then the videos.

138
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.020
Right now, what we want is inside this video's collection.

139
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.510
We want to have the comments inside.

140
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.770
Now, this is going to get very confusing to you now on.

141
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.340
So you're going to see this structure in the database.

142
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.100
So what we're basically saying now is within the videos, videos, collection, we want to have another

143
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.380
collection which is going to be the collect collection.

144
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.120
Okay.

145
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.610
They need to link this video's collection to that comments collection.

146
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.230
We need to link it with something.

147
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.160
And that's what I did.

148
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.170
So now we need to say dot doc and the idea is going to be this post ID we have later.

149
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.270
Okay.

150
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.260
And now we can.

151
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.430
Then see Dot's collection.

152
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.600
And once I have a collection inside this video collection.

153
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.910
Card comments.

154
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.990
Okay.

155
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.630
And now we can then say gifts.

156
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.460
Okay, great.

157
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:04.040
And now what we can do is we can specify as Libyan leaders, because we basically have a number and

158
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.390
we can say is experts you.

159
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.290
This Orthodox rabbi we have.

160
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.840
While ducks and.

161
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.290
Dots, dots plus each.

162
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.040
Documents.

163
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.240
And thoughts.

164
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.010
Not Lent.

165
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.000
Okay, I think.

166
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.510
We are unable to.

167
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:27.780
Okay.

168
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.700
Dart guards, all ducks.

169
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.500
This equates to.

170
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.770
We cannot wait.

171
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.220
This.

172
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.200
Okay.

173
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.220
And there's going to be.

174
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.270
But we have.

175
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.900
The arts.

176
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.350
Docs to assess each document we have in the comments, and now we can see that lens.

177
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.700
Okay, great.

178
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.130
Okay, great.

179
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.710
Now about yeah, we got the current logged in user.

180
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.640
Right.

181
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.850
And over here we are set to get to the comments.

182
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:14.850
That is how many comment we have and avira simply gets an access to the comment in the way as if something

183
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.530
gets in our many comments.

184
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.000
These are uploaded so far.

185
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.860
Okay, great.

186
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.340
Now all we need to do now is to.

187
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.190
Create a rainbow now card comment.

188
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.510
I think you've seen others before and we can specify it is a type of the comment model.

189
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.120
Okay.

190
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.450

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:41.680
Okay.

192
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.180
I'm just gonna wait for it to.

193
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:43.660
Okay.

194
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.140
Yeah.

195
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:45.800
Okay.

196
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.810
For the user name is going to be this we should send before we need to wrap this and we can say user.

197
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.460
User, Doc.

198
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.080

Dot data.

200
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.520
And now we need to see us die.

201
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:10.920
Now, Mick, like you've said this before, it's a key dynamic and for the comment is going to be the

202
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.720
comment tests.

203
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.330
Okay.

204
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:15.930
Great.

205
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:23.530
For the dead published is going to be we're just going to get the current dates that's post that comment

206
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.960

207
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.280
Date.

208
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.670
Time starts now.

209
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.600
Okay.

210
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.430
And for the likes.

211
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:32.730
Okay.

212
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:32.940
Sorry.

213
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.780
I think we need to chill.

214
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.030
Come over here and for the likes.

215
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.210
We can give name to these for now.

216
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:39.810
Okay.

217
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:41.990
Okay.

218
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.660
And so I think over year.

219
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.240
We need to core.

220
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.370
So over here we need to coordinate.

221
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.250
Right.

222
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.640
Okay.

223
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.880
So what we can do is we can copy this.

224
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.700
Copy this.

225
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.660
And so because we had a no check of a year.

226
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.730
Okay.

227
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.030
And now we can basically copy this.

228
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.360
Controversy and.

229
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.240
For the profile photo.

230
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.990
Look, I'm just going to go to that and 25 for two.

231
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.880
We need two PCs over year and change this to what?

232
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.180
Profi.

233
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.100
So if five foot two.

234
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.330
Okay.

235
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.340
And now we can get rid of this.

236
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.640
Okay for the new ID.

237
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.810
What we have to say is we can basically just copy and paste that over here, but we can't as well just

238
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.900
see what's controller.

239
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.560
Hearts are.

240
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.000
Let's control agreeable dux user.

241
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.490
That's you, Heidi.

242
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.810
Right.

243
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.500
Okay.

244
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.530
And as well, we need this over here.

245
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.430
Okay.

246
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.190
And for the I.D. is going to be how many comments we have.

247
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.720
Okay.

248
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.730
That's okay for the ID.

249
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.440
We can say comments.

250
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.100
Comments.

251
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:31.610
And this is going to be the water and the land whereby we have over.

252
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.600
Sorry.

253
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.170
Okay.

254
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:36.520
Okay.

255
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.990
I just know about this.

256
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.620
Okay.

257
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.640
So I think.

258
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.580
I'm just going to check on the fine name.

259
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.990
I think we do have.

260
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.400
Okay.

261
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.360
Recorded what?

262
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.860
Recorded what?

263
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.820
Recorded what?

264
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.080
Or does.

265
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.710
They then mistakenly deleted the art.

266
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.870
Okay, so what we can do is we can see, uh, it's.

267
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.680
Leonard.

268
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.200
I think I probably mistakenly deleted that.

269
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.340
And it's going to be all.

270
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.110
Docs.

271
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.090
Orthodox.

272
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.840
Orthodox.

273
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.940
Dodds dogs to assess how many comments we have and what's next.

274
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.910
Okay.

275
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:26.810
Okay.

276
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.210
Great.

277
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.480
I think we needed a semicolon.

278
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.840
Okay.

279
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.470
Great.

280
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.360
And over here, we need this.

281
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.410
Okay, great.

282
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.740
Okay.

283
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.280
Great.

284
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:38.720
Okay.

285
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.360
Over here.

286
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.760
We created a rainbow.

287
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:42.840
Sorry.

288
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.960
Just gonna start this again.

289
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.810
First of all, we created.

290
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.880
Okay, so we need to change this.

291
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.600
We need to change this to underscore.

292
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.190
This core comment comments.

293
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.580
Okay.

294
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.380
And we are saying we don't have any comment over here.

295
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.230
And yeah, we created a rainbow, which is going to be the height of each comment.

296
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.730
Right.

297
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:11.990
And over a year, we created a tribe block in order to check if this comment is not empty.

298
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.810
That is, if the user actually have it test.

299
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.330
Then we want you.

300
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:24.320
First of all, get the comment, the user always making that comment and as well gets in the comments

301
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.290
and we are busily getting the comments and then also have access to how many comments we have and the

302
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.200
way we create any verbal code comments.

303
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.140
If Abebooks comment on this is the type of the comment, mother.
