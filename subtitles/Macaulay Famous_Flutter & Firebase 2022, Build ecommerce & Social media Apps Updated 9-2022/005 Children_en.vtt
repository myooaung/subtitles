00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.029
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.210
In this lecture, we are going to continue from where we stopped.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.970
Okay, now what's in the special tie?

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.410
It's also do have a property known as children.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.960
And for the first child is going to be a container with jets.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.820
And we can give this container a height of some hundred and also a width.

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.870
We can just double dot infinity to take the available with space.

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.450
Okay.

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.200
And now we can have a declaration and a declaration in order to have access to a lot of property the

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.820
container has.

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.720
And now we can give this a colour of colours.

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.190
The sign.

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.700
That's fine.

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.150
And also, we can give this some opacity.

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.400
Of zero two.

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.190
This country needs to save.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.610
And we check this out now.

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.050
Okay.

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.980
Click on this.

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.940
Sounds good.

22
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.120
So it was good.

23
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.770
Okay.

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.790
And now it's in the chart.

25
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.150
Sorry.

26
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.490
Within the container.

27
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.410
We can then have a chart.

28
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.420
Over a child.

29
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.720
And the child is going to be a column which has.

30
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.710
Colon.

31
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.030
And children is a safe and that's a format.

32
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.480
And while we can have a test widget, this is going to say name.

33
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.750
Name we can just add.

34
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.770
Plus, maybe.

35
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.530
So I think we're just going to use this type.

36
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.780
Okay.

37
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.000
It's necessary first and let's go check.

38
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.020
That's going to look like.

39
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.750
This is the riot.

40
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410
And we tend to call.

41
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.210
We can then see cross assessments, cross assess alignment.

42
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.420
Dots start, okay.

43
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.390
And now we can have a dollar sign in order to concatenate a variable.

44
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.470
And it says.

45
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.140
And this is going to be the order and.

46
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.120
I think we have a field is going to check this customer name.

47
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.690
Okay.

48
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.350
Customer name.

49
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.130
So.

50
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.470
Is necessary.

51
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.340
And since school.

52
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.210
And how did you recover?

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.470
And what we can then do as we can.

54
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.400
Copy this.

55
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.830
And paste.

56
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.560
This is going to say email.

57
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.290
Address.

58
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.720
And we can pass this again.

59
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110
And I think we have a field no less.

60
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.470
Email address.

61
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.450
Okay.

62
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.120
Email.

63
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.620
Okay.

64
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.300
Well, Via.

65
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.820
Email.

66
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.340
So it's not there.

67
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.020
Email.

68
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.470
And this is going to say maybe phone.

69
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.430
Number and I think within that field.

70
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.420
We should have phone.

71
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.450
Okay.

72
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.190
Phone.

73
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.620
Okay.

74
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.470
Use control and save and check this out.

75
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.440
Okay.

76
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.080
Sounds good.

77
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.060
And now we can have the address and I think we have that over.

78
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.110
Address this message if we do.

79
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.149
Jess.

80
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.430
Okay, we do have.

81
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.980
And we can pace this again.

82
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.440
And this is going to say address and I think we call that field address, but currently we have no address.

83
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.560
In the future.

84
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.610
Users are going to be able to have their address and also their phone number.

85
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.880
Address.

86
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.940
Okay.

87
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.550
And we also do need the payment status so we can just copy this.

88
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.780
And Pace and we are.

89
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.470
Prevent.

90
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.010
Statues.

91
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.760
Human statues.

92
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.040
And I think within the field, within the order we have.

93
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.230
10 minutes.

94
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.190
That's okay.

95
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.350
Payment status.

96
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.160
Taxes he's going to try to save.

97
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.620
Okay.

98
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.900
Okay.

99
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.740
So school.

100
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.720
And.

101
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.720
Okay.

102
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.760
This is catch on delivery.

103
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.270
We can just add this and that.

104
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.600
Separated.

105
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.210
This as well.

106
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.580
This.

107
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.760
This.

108
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.740
This is an effort to save.

109
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.890
And now we can have the delivery status.

110
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.940
Is this?

111
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.270
They live very.

112
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.460
Cities.

113
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.150
Okay.

114
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.200
And I think we have a field known as the league.

115
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.800
Various status.

116
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.020
Okay.

117
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.280
Good.

118
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.330
Check this out.

119
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.280
Delivery status.

120
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.160
Okay.

121
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.830
Then lastly.

122
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.610
We can have the SD estimated.

123
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.290
Estimated.

124
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.470
Estimated delivery date.

125
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.620
The delivery date.

126
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.290
And this is going to be I think we have a field known as delivery date.

127
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.550
I'm just going to check this.

128
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.260
Cruel.

129
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.860
Square.

130
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.520
Okay, we.

131
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.800
Hopefully we do.

132
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.380
So if we did.

133
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.780
I don't think we do.

134
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.080
I'm going to check that.

135
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.790
Payment.

136
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.490
Payment screen.

137
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.900
Delivery date.

138
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.280
Okay, we do.

139
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.760
This in the cockpit.

140
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.770
I think we have it over.

141
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.260
Okay.

142
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.500
Okay.

143
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.460
We do.

144
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.470
Maybe I can't find it.

145
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.790
Well, maybe I can.

146
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.510
Says.

147
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.300
There's this.

148
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.830
Okay.

149
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.220
And hopefully we have theirs.

150
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.680
That means we do have it.

151
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.730
Okay.

152
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.770
That means we have it.

153
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.130
Delivery dates.

154
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.430
And currently I think we do not have any delivery dates.

155
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:20.300
And now what we can do is we can submit us elements minus elements.

156
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.880
Minus element of space evenly.

157
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.650
This.

158
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.540
Okay.

159
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.610
Some school.

160
00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.470
Look, guys, see you in the next lecture.
