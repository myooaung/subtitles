00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.650
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.039
In this lecture, we are going to display the seller's products in the body.

4
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:15.990
Okay, now to do this, we have to head back to our VTS code and within the scaffold.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.830
As you know, it has a property known as body.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.040
Now for the body, it's going to be a string builder.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:32.130
Okay, so what we can do is we can go to the gallery directory gallery and we can just copy from the

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.940
electronics.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.540
Okay.

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.590
And via where we are returning distributor we can highlight.

11
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.510
To.

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.690
I think it ends over.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.730
Yeah, right.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.610
Use control and see to copy.

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.520
And back to the visits to our screen and get rid of this and -- OC over this to see what we are

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.240
missing.

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.900
Expected to find another parenthesis and I think we need to get rid of that.

18
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.750
Okay.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.670
Via semicolon.

20
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.370
Okay, great.

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.810
And now we have to import all this.

22
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.630
And part.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.430
Okay.

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.380
Import.

25
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
And in part the models as well.

26
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.390
Okay.

27
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.560
And now we have this error.

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.360
So what we have to do is back to the electronics and we have to copy this.

29
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.460
Head back to the visitor and we have to pace this with ten year.

30
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.540
Right.

31
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.780
Okay.

32
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.280
We're just going to pass this via.

33
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.190
Maybe of the before this piece.

34
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.090
Okay, great.

35
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.310
Well, this time around, we are going to retrieve products where the seller.

36
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.490
You.

37
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.230
I'd.

38
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.960
We had the seller uid is equal to the store uid okay not to do this.

39
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.180
This is going to be we're.

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.640
The seller you ID is going to be equal to this seller.

41
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.240
Your ID remember the seller, your ID is basically referring to the store ID copy.

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.100
Don't forget that as most of the time if you forget, you're going to get confused on your ID and this

43
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.410
is basically hits.

44
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.230
Okay.

45
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.100
And.

46
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.500
And even though products we want to say.

47
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.900
Uh.

48
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.530
This.

49
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.730
This store.

50
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.470
This tour.

51
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.440
He has no eyes.

52
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.340
And yet I think that is okay.

53
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.870
And go check it out.

54
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.050
Okay.

55
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.600
I think we have a product for this store.

56
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.950
Okay.

57
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.370
Sorry, no product.

58
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.840
Okay.

59
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.900
And this store has no item yet.

60
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.660
Remember the reason we have to change that?

61
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.080
You can see why before we were having this made.

62
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.010
Category is equal to electronics and that was why we are having we are having that electronics products.

63
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.860
So we have to say we had a seller.

64
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.310
Your ID and you can see what's in the products.

65
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.250
The products we have this field called Seller UID, which is basically referring to the uid of the user

66
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.500
and we are saying where is equal to the store uid?

67
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.760
Is equal to the seller uid whereby the seller ID is basically referring to the store uid because in

68
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.870
the store screen.

69
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.890
This touchscreen.

70
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.110
Touchscreen what we basically did was to pass the store your ID to that so that screen.

71
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.890
So it's basically referring to the store, your ID.

72
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.750
So we had this UID is equal to the store ID, we really want to retrieve that product.

73
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.800
And currently you can see this user has not uploaded any product.

74
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.110
Sorry, we just have to change that test back.

75
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.710
To say we're sorry.

76
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.560
This test.

77
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.840
This tour.

78
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.110
This store has no product yet.

79
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.020
Please Control to save.

80
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.590
And you should be saying this to us.

81
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.130
The.

82
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.730
As Nice said.

83
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.060
Yes.

84
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.530
Okay.

85
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.680
Now check this joy store.
