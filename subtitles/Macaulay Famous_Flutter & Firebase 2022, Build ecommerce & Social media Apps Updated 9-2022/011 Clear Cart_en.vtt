00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.290
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.130
In this lecture, we are going to be able to play our cards, items, data.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.870
Okay, now to do this, we have to go to the provider directory and the cards on this call.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.170
Provider five okay.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.430
And the first step is to create a function over here.

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
We have to save void and we are going to call this function.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.840
Claire cos.

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.690
We within the princess is we are not going to pass any product value.

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.530
And the reason for this is because we do not want to clear a specific product, but we basically want

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.970
to clear the products we have in our cart.

12
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.170
So all we just have to say is to call the on the score list.

13
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.990
Right and dot clay so we know that cast that clear.

14
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.150
Okay.

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:10.930
You can see this on the score list variable as a variable which stores call the added cut item.

16
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.720
And you can see currently we have just, just two products added to this on the score list variable.

17
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.220
Okay.

18
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:29.050
And lastly, we have to say notify, notify listener in order to get that current update or the update,

19
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.300
we are basically making use control and save.

20
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.510
And now we have to go to the cart.

21
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.070
The Cards screen.

22
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.700
And you can see we have this button of the delete forever and you can see over here we have the consumer

23
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.450
and we have the cards provider class and we basically have this card provider variable.

24
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.030
And you can see this card provides a variable as a variable that's you can see the value as a variable

25
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.280
that stores this card provider class.

26
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.860
Right.

27
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.270
And you can see why we do not have access to discuss provider variable because this comes first.

28
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.080
So what we can then say we can use the context that read and as well you can use the provider of context.

29
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.200
But for some reasons we are just going to use this right?

30
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:29.410
Or you can just use that context, the treat and we have to specify it is the card provider class we

31
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.970
want to have access to.

32
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.560
Okay.

33
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.560
So by doing this, we then have access to all everything within the cards, provide a class and all

34
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.430
we just have to say is to call the class cards and this is basically it use controller.

35
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.540
And has to save.

36
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.450
And.

37
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.030
And click on this OC, you can see God's deleted.

38
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.840
And then what we can do is this content be.

39
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.010
We can then have a check.

40
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.450
You can see currently we do not have any item in our cards and for this purpose we are then going to

41
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.580
display this over here, which is basically saying your card is empty.

42
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.170
Okay.

43
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.590
To do this in order to update the UI without any errors or any complications, we are then going to

44
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.570
say contest dot.

45
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.610
Contest.

46
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.120
Sorry.

47
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.770
I think we have to automatically contest.

48
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.160
Contest.

49
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.640
Contest.

50
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.090
Contest.

51
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.020
Contest.

52
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.630
Dot.

53
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.730
Watch.

54
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.280
Now, that's a check for the hobbits.

55
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.430
And this is going to be cut provider.

56
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.990
This guy wants to have access to.

57
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.060
The cuts.

58
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.350
So Clint says that watch.

59
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.760
That watch and this should be over.

60
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.080
Cuts provider.

61
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.900
And we want access to the get items and we are going to say dots is not empty.

62
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.470
If it is not empty, it means we already have a product.

63
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.160
Then we want to display the product.

64
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.690
Look, I think we need this over here.

65
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.450
Okay.

66
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.730
Now click on this else.

67
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.550
If it is empty, we then want to display the center widget, which basically has this test which says

68
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.130
your cart is empty and highlight from this point to this.

69
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.000
In this country and has to save.

70
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.950
And go check it out.

71
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.810
I think currently we do not have any item in our card.

72
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.390
And you can see we are saying this, your card is empty and go back and hard again.

73
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.000
Just going to add another.

74
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.440
Okay.

75
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.530
Howard again and click on this.

76
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.010
Okay, click on this.

77
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.810
Okay.

78
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.540
Your card isn't working as expected.

79
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.540
So I think for more simplicity.

80
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.100
Let's go with this contest that watch.

81
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.420
Then passing the provider and the name of the provider.

82
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.910
And this is basically referring to we are basically saying we want to have access to the cards provider

83
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.860
class or the source of the data we want to use is the cards provider.

84
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.930
Okay, so for more simplicity, please choose this contest.

85
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.710
Watch.

86
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.710
Instead of the provider of contest, then the listing is equal to true.

87
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.300
Choose this.

88
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.130
And also choose this.

89
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.230
The context that we provide.

90
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.310
And in the future, I'm going to tell you the reason why we have to go with this and this.

91
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.550
And not.

92
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.830
I think we have that in our code.

93
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.080
And.

94
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.760
And and and.

95
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.470
And and not this.

96
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.250
In the future, I'm going to tell you that.

97
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.160
Or you can let me know if you are interested or definitely I'm going to tell you because it is needed.

98
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.690
You know, it's just required.

99
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.100
You know, it's okay.

100
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.810
We're just going to have some more products and hopefully we have no errors.

101
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.570
Or maybe we could also we start this.

102
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.850
Okay.

103
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.560
Okay.

104
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.930
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
