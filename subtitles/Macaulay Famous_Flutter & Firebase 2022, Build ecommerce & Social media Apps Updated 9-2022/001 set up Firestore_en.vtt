00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.510
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.050
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.340
Now of other users tab.

4
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.800
You can see we currently have one side of it.

5
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.450
Now the problem is we have some additional fields such as the full name and user name are the reason

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.900
for this.

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.370
So we have more information about the sign up user.

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.100
Okay.

9
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.130
But unfortunately, the firebase only supports the email and the password.

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.720
So what we can do, we can store the data.

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.690
There is data or all the data in this class to our database.

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.170
Okay.

13
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.200
Now, in this lecture on the sets of the first database.

14
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.770
So what you are going to do, remember, it is on the educational tab.

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.910
We also will enable the email and password.

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.110
So in order for us to use the fire store database.

17
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.340
Yes, of course.

18
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.810
Regression we need to do.

19
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.480
So what I want to do is I'm going to click on it or I'm going to open in a new tab.

20
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.340
Okay.

21
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.270
Okay.

22
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.900
Okay.

23
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.830
Now we are going to click on Create Database.

24
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.550
Okay.

25
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.700
That is asking either to choose to start in production mode or choose the start to test.

26
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.590
Well, you can either just go with the test mode or the production mode.

27
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.520
Not really a big deal.

28
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.650
You can just go ahead with the prediction mode.

29
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.190
Okay.

30
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.890
For now, I'm just going to go ahead with the test mode.

31
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.330
Okay.

32
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
Now, I will click on next.

33
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.720
Okay.

34
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.200
We can go with the defaults or you can just click on it to select.

35
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.390
They're going to click on it.

36
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.010
Okay.

37
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.080
This is going to take some time.

38
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.020
It's going to take some time.

39
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.030
Okay.

40
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.570
Or what I'm just going to do with to stuff this video.

41
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.210
And in this picture, we're going to continue.

42
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.720
Okay.

43
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.630
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
