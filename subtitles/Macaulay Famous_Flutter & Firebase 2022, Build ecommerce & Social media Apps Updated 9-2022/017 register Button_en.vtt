00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.570
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.330
That is that you're now going to create the user model well before that, since we are going to store

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.150
all our data as it is for our store database.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.710
First of all, we are going to set of this fast database that's a gift.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.580
So this page of all just have to do is to click on this vast database that you're going to click or

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.200
create database.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.820
Okay, now this building has for start in production mode or starts in test will either go with this

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.250
or this is going to go with the stats tests what that will look like on tests.

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.660
Okay.

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.630
I think I tried to explain this to you before.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.710
I'm just going to go with the defaults so I what to pick on a level.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.330
Okay.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.620
Now.

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340
Well this is doing.

16
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.690
I got to go back to our.

17
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.720
Via the code.

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.280
Now, over a year.

19
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.340
This is a function to upload the image to the storage.

20
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.730
Right.

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.920
We said the photos were the record.

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
So if I fix that, the information is going to be the correct user.

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.150
The user you already located over there.

24
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.530
We are simply uploading that image.

25
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.190
Okay.

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.350
Then over a year we are recruited.

27
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.560
You are at the helm of that image from the storage.

28
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:41.420
Now this is a function writes code where we store user, we have orders values of and then we said if

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.690
this values user name is not, see the image name till the password is not empty or the image is not

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.750
empty, it is not empty.

31
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.520
Did we want to create the user with the HEMU password?

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.590
We also want to.

33
00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.580
Upload.

34
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.190
The perfect image of that user whereby this is the function over here so is going to trigger.

35
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.110
This function.

36
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.220
Okay, great.

37
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.410
Now we don't really want to upload the image to storage.

38
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.350
We also want to upload all the data us to the.

39
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.580
So for us to have these fast auditors this okay, now to do this, I'm just going to hurt.

40
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.420
So we'll just take them out of the network issues.

41
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.540
As I love I love doing doing behind the scenes.

42
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.490
Okay, great.

43
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.250
Now what you're going to do.

44
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.250
Over a year.

45
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.070
First of all, I'm just going to go to my constant calls, the Dodge Fe.

46
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.290
Because all the creative people code for is just the record player.

47
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.500
Fast or.

48
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.130
The kid's going to be close to the fire.

49
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.680
These.

50
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.170
First or Eastern.

51
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.940
Okay, great.

52
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.940
Is the company's culture dirt.

53
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.770
Okay.

54
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.600
Okay, great.

55
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.310
Now I'm going to go to the outskirts, realize what drove me to be this way.

56
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.280
Not to upload all this data.

57
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.630
What we can simply say.

58
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.730
First, we are going to create a users coalition over that is like in for the we are all our users.

59
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.760
It's going to be stored.

60
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.860
Okay so to do that.

61
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.970
They just.

62
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.240
We just have to see.

63
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.070
Fire.

64
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.960
Fast or stored.

65
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.970
Collection.

66
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.080
Okay.

67
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.660
Now, the name of the coalition or the name of the for the citizens is for the recorders users.

68
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.780
They said dot doc.

69
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.590
Okay.

70
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.690
Now what they're going to try to do rather than link each user to the users coalition to do that is

71
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.190
going to secrete that these are carried over to the user that you already.

72
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.680
Okay so pass this over now to Mr. able to do.

73
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.810
We are just going to sit sit.

74
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.830
Okay.

75
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.850
There has been all this data like.

76
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.340
Email.

77
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.590
Yeah.

78
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.430
Okay.

79
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.010
But if we do it this way and so hard, right.

80
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.530
As well, you can just see.

81
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.610
Username.

82
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.030
Username, huh?

83
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.540
When we do this, we.

84
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.910
Then there is no need for the NVC.

85
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.160
Right.

86
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.840
So what I'm going to do.

87
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.940
They're going to create airfields that are similar to this.

88
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.240
They're going to assign those fields to all this.

89
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.800
Okay.

90
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.120
So to do this, I want to go to our models dot that fly.

91
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.740
So our models for the variable to create a fire code, use a dot dot.

92
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.800
Okay.

93
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.570
Okay.

94
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.840
So we're going to create the A class will call this class user.

95
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.400
Okay.

96
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.560
Now we're going to create the fields we need.

97
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.790
First of all, we need to name is going to be a type of string.

98
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.980
We also need to.

99
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.880
Profile photo, which is going to be a side to the image for five.

100
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.480
For two.

101
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.890
We need to.

102
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.050
Email.

103
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.340
That's where we need to.

104
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.520
You idiot.

105
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.880
Okay, Dynasty, we're going to do we're going to create constructor for these fields.

106
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.980
So it is going to be easier.

107
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.890
Okay.

108
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.630
There's going to be this dirt.

109
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.020
Dave.

110
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.540
Okay, we're just going to make this required raising the required keyword.

111
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.580
There's going to be this.

112
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.390
The two, four, five, four, two as well required.

113
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.970
Our job is to make this right.

114
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.190
Okay.

115
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.480
This is going to be it is so required for us.

116
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.830
It is going to be this dirt.

117
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.010
Email.

118
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.970
As required.

119
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.940
There's going to be this dirt.

120
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.710
So this thought.

121
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.260
You are ready.

122
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.610
Okay, great.

123
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.320
Now, the next day, we are going to do what all this data is to a map.

124
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.150
So to do that, all we just have to say is maps.

125
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.450
You can see all this are basically test.

126
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.310
So it is going to be a type.

127
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.920
Of so.

128
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.640
Matt.

129
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.950
It's going to be a type of string.

130
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.640
But as will dynamic.

131
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:40.140
So they're going to say to Jason, you basically want to convert it to a map or an object.

132
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.280
If you don't know what is object, object is something that basically as a property.

133
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.450
The property name.

134
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.310
Okay.

135
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.050
Were function very.

136
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.220
So what I will see is.

137
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.230
It's big.

138
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.320
So you.

139
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.300
Because these is going to be our function.

140
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.830
Dynamic.

141
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.560
Okay.

142
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.150
Sorry.

143
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.130
Okay.

144
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:22.730
Great.

145
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.890
Know just how to say the name comma.

146
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.929
Photo.

147
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.809
Yara Hill So what's the.

148
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.539
So so far.

149
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:41.620
For two.

150
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.140
It's going to be.

151
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.420
Four, five, four, two.

152
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.700
The kid is going to be Emile.

153
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.230
Email.

154
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.850
Going to be email.

155
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.330
Okay.

156
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.270
There's going to be you I.D..

157
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.270
I d.

158
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.580
Okay, great.

159
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.650
So we are basically converting all the data to a map.

160
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.540
Okay.

161
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.920
So this is the property name.

162
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.440
This is the value, right?

163
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.280
So it does basically objects.

164
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.690
Okay, great.

165
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:28.650
Now what you're going to do next, be able to create the instructions of how a user is going to be created.

166
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:35.640
So to do that, you can either see a factory or can you just use the static as well?

167
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.480
Static.

168
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.480
Static.

169
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.180
Okay.

170
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.280
Now as well.

171
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.760
It's going to be a type of string dynamic.

172
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.050
Okay.

173
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.970
So.

174
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.460
Sorry.

175
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:56.990
So.

176
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.250
Okay, this should be static then the user.

177
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.950
We are basically creating the destruction of our user is going to be created.

178
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.100
So this is going to be this user, right?

179
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.850
So we are going to see from SNAP.

180
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.070
Occasionally this capital letter.

181
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.260
Okay.

182
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.170
So since we are dealing with a user, it is going to be type of the COVID snapshot.

183
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.400
You can see SNAP.

184
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.660
Okay.
