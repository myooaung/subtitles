00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.660
Hey.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.360
In this lecture, we will be able to navigate with ten pages.

4
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.939
Okay.

5
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.470
Now, to do this, we're going to need to go back to our visa code.

6
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.770
And what we can do for now is over here, we are going to create a finer and then a list of pages.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
And what we can do is over here, we're going to specify that within the list.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.110
We're going to be using widgets.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.900
So we get.

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.480
And we can had a trillion sorry, a semicolon over there.

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.490
And over here we can have a center with jets and the child.

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.130
Then the test.

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.600
For now.

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.350
This is just going to say on screen later, we're going to create all these pages, look at the trail

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.790
cover and now we can copy and paste.

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.050
This is going to be for the category.

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.770
So over here we can then say category.

18
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.300
And paste this should be for the shop cards and profile.

19
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.400
So this is going to be.

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.140
Shop.

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.910
And this is going to be.

22
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.020
Cats.

23
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.690
And this is going to be.

24
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.110
The profile.

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.640
Okay.

26
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.760
Now what we can do?

27
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.020
We can use control.

28
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.280
Unless we can.

29
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.770
Just a list of pages.

30
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.320
Right?

31
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.920
Okay.

32
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.060
Later we are going to create all these pages, but for now, we can just go with this.

33
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.720
Now, as you know, the scaffold has a property known as body, which you can see we have a trailer

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.410
combat by.

35
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.110
If you don't, you can just have a newcomer in order to know where this bottom navigation bar hands.

36
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.140
Okay.

37
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.300
Now, within the scaffold it has a property which is the body.

38
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.620
And for the body, it's going to be the list of pages.

39
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.550
And within this list we can then score the on the score selected.

40
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.460
Selected item now holds three studies.

41
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.440
Both we this.

42
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.630
And this is the selected item we are referring to as the default.

43
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.430
It is set to zero and whenever we click on any of the bottom navigation bar item, it's going to help

44
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.610
date the UI.

45
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.020
Right?

46
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.620
Okay.

47
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.030
I think we.

48
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.510
Just call pages.

49
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.810
And we're basically using the sensor widgets home screen.

50
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.220
Okay.

51
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.850
This is it of the homescreen and the category screen.

52
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.600
This is the shop screen.

53
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.140
The car screen and the profile screen.

54
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.780
Okay.

55
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.050
So in the next lecture, we're going to start creating all those pages.

56
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.160
Okay.

57
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.210
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
