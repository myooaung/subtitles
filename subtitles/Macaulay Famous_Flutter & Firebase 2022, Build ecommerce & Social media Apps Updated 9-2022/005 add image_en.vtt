00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.980
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.310
In this lecture, we're going to start designing the login screen.

4
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.730
Okay?

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
Now what we can do is we can get rid of this center widgets.

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.100
Okay?

7
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.000
We can just break this.

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.330
Okay?

9
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.900
Now we're going to have in theory, widgets, and this three widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

10
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.240
That is from top to bottom.

11
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.600
Okay.

12
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.190
Now I know that's a display widget.

13
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.930
Vertically Flatter has a widget known as column.

14
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.410
Okay.

15
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.290
Okay.

16
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.320
Now, this color widget can take in multiple widgets, so it adds this to drain.

17
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.730
Okay, now the first child is going to be a test widget.

18
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.230
And is this going to say, uh, starts?

19
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.580
Starts or join a meeting.

20
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.610
Methane addiction and or value and then use contra.

21
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.530
And that's to say, okay, now let's check this out.

22
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.600
You can see the wire.

23
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.080
Okay.

24
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.830
Now, all we can do is this column has a property known as main US element.

25
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.320
And we can see main elements.

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.470
Dot Center.

27
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.730
Okay.

28
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.980
This will take you to the center vertically.

29
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.520
Okay.

30
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.510
Let's see what it does.

31
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.490
Okay, great.

32
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.900
Okay.

33
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.540
Now, the next thing we're gonna need to do is we can start this test.

34
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.960
Okay.

35
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.940
Now, this test has a property known as Ty, and it's going to be test tie, which simply means we want

36
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.710
this tied to test.

37
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.060
Okay.

38
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.780
And now we can see the font size.

39
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.680
That is, we want to increase the size of the test to 24.

40
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.930
24 and as well, this does die as the property known as false weeds.

41
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.430
You can see once the okay font suite darts board.

42
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.180
Okay.

43
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.250
Now make sure you have your tree a comma over here and over here.

44
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.750
And now you can use control.

45
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.560
And that's to save.

46
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.310
Okay.

47
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.180
You can see it's okay.

48
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.870
Now, the next widget we are going to be having is the image widget.

49
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.130
Okay?

50
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.750
We're going to be doing this outside this test widget, right?

51
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.400
So this is the first widget and now we are about to had the second widget.

52
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.790
Okay.

53
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.090
Okay.

54
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.100
There's going to be image thoughts.

55
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.850
Assets.

56
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.710
I can now we can give the location of that on boarding.

57
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.130
Okay.

58
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.940
It is located at assets and images.

59
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.740
Then discard on br, then den j p g.

60
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.310
Okay.

61
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.600
How did you recover?

62
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.440
How did you recover?

63
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.020
And is country a necessary.

Great.

66
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.770
Now you can sit over here.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.220
Okay.
