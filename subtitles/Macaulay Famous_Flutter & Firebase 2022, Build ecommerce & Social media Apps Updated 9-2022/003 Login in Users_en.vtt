00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.650
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.940
Worker Now an elastic shoe.

3
00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.600
We created a function which we called log in, use us.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.100
Then we pass in.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.080
Some fields are going to be needed.

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.320
That is the email and password.

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.420
Then over here we created a verbal address to store the possible herbs, which is some error account.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.370
Okay.

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.180
Then after we created a try and a catch block.

10
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.640
Okay.

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.720
Now, over the tri blog, we created some validation check.

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.870
That is, we said if the email and the password is not empty, then only we want to sign in the user

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.660
with the email and password.

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.370
Then they're going to update the variable to sources, which means that's user spin side and then as

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.820
well they're going to press.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.600
You are now logged into the console.

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.440
Okay.

18
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:08.180
Now over here, we are simply saying if the user refuses to fill in the fields, then we want to send

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.530
a message to the user, which is these fields must not be empty.

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.970
Okay, now in this lecture, they're going to implement this function.

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.720
Okay?

22
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.760
Now to do this, I'm getting ready to make this white first.

23
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.740
Then they're going to go to our log in screen.

24
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.650
Okay.

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.130
Now, first of all, what you're going to do is you're going to get the value the user is going to type

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.620
in to this email fields and this password hint not to do this.

27
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.190
The resultant card test it.

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.090
It's a controller.

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.680
And I told, you know, I'm right.

30
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.190
So did you do this yourself?

31
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.570
Yes.

32
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.210
I told you to do this.

33
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.580
Okay.

34
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.980
Now, if for any reason you can't do this, it is absolutely fine.

35
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.400
What I believe if we should do this one more time, you're going to be able to grasp the process.

36
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.860
Okay.

37
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.900
Now you need to grab.

38
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.660
The values the user is going to type in.

39
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.240
That is for the email and for the password.

40
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.530
They're going to have to create a variable first and say that variable to what is known as test and

41
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.430
it's a controller.

42
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.380
They are going to find that variable.

43
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.870
So both fields, that means you're going to have to test at.

44
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.600
It's a controller.

45
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.600
Okay, now let's do it.

46
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.590
Okay.

47
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.430
Now there's going to be a finer right.

48
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.790
We can call this or this call email controller.

49
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.520
There's going to be a court to test ads.

50
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.600
It's in comptroller.

51
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.900
Okay.

52
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.320
So this is going to steal the value from the user.

53
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.920
Okay.

54
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.320
Now, some of the time you kind of word the type, both are just going to give the type.

55
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.960
It is a type of test editor controller.

56
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.470
Okay.

57
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.310
We're going to do the same set for the email sorry for the password to still these a password hardest

58
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.540
to the these of value.

59
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.970
So this is the desktop password controller.

60
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.100
It's going to be quite a test.

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.420
It it's Cuadrilla.

62
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.210
Okay.

63
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.440
Then we can also avoid the type or we can just give it type that it is.

64
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.780
It just it it's a controller.

65
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.380
Okay, now we're going to buy this.

66
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.200
The values or sorry are going to bind this variable to those two fields.

67
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.100
Okay.

68
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.410
Now this is the email.

69
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.980
So over here you're going to see a controller.

70
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.470
So in with your butt controller, this is going to be all the score email.

71
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.300
Controller.

72
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.260
Okay, so there's still the value of that inputs.

73
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.840
This is going to type it so.

74
00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.950
What they're going to do.

75
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.160
This is for the password.

76
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.150
There's going to be a controller as well.

77
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.270
So it's going to be all this called password.

78
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.290
Then the controller.

79
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.310
Okay, great.

80
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.280
Now, we've asked you to do this.

81
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.390
Okay.

82
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.620
So now over the log in said we have already wrapped the test widget with a button, so it becomes what's

83
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.550
clickable.

84
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.020
If you don't have yours for any reason, you can easily click on this.

85
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.110
A large first year contract that they're going to be called Rapid Switch and then they're going to wrap

86
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.000
it with equal widgets.

87
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.890
Then they're going to tap the old tab.

88
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.060
Okay, great.

89
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.740
So now what they're going to do is.

90
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.850
In order to have access to this.

91
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.360
Log in users we need to first assess two is father and his father is a class called art controller.

92
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.000
Okay so.

93
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.870
First of all, I says the father or the controller.

94
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.080
Art, art, control.

95
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.360
We need to call these spaces into parenthesis to set dots, log end uses.

96
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.720
So this is going to be on this call password.

97
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.080
So this automatically sorry is going to be on this email.

98
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.020
So this is represents the value of write probabilities that type in mark.

99
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.490
So this is going to be Mark Right.

100
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.170
So we're going to set dots test now to get the value of what the user type ain't.

101
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.910
So this is going to be for this call password, right?

102
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.320
Password, then dot test.

103
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.030
Okay, great.

104
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.990
Now.

105
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.290
The problem is we can live with that as is basically it, but we are able to show you a loaded subpoena

106
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.910
in case there is an error.

107
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.720
We want to show the user that that's error.

108
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.070
Now, to do this, they're going to use it if statements if an error statement.

109
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.460
Right.

110
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.290
So if what to do, this is going to be much impossible because we cannot use that is why we're going

111
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.160
to get an error.

112
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.010
So what we can do is we can actually just call this off from year.

113
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.680
Okay.

114
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.420
Then.

115
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.640
We are going to do it this year.

116
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.600
So.

117
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.800
You're.

118
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.410
They're going to create a verbal code.

119
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.200
So it's not a verbal, but a function.

120
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.180
I think you should be doing it to me right now.

121
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.440
Log in.

122
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.140
He is.

123
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.960
Okay.

124
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.520
It's going to be similar to that sign up we did earlier.

125
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.480
Okay.

126
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.150
First, they're going to pass in the sink because they're going to be using a weight.

127
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.900
So now look at the pace this.

128
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.580
Okay.

129
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.570
Great.

130
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.400
Is Katrina safe?

131
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.780
And that's a a good format.

132
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.830
Okay.

133
00:06:52.830 --> 00:07:00.570
Now, what you can do is you can store this the travel code, where's that is going to wait and the

134
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.940
odds control the log in and out and so on.

135
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.200
Okay.

136
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.060
Now, because it is a type of straight, you can see it once also had the type.

137
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.940
So sometimes you might need to add the type and sometimes you might need not too hard in the type.

138
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.470
Okay, great.

139
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.220
Now, what you're going to do next is they're going to use the statement.

140
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:29.500
So we're going to say if if if if race is not equal to.

141
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.390
Sussex.

142
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.040
That's is.

143
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.490
The sign.

144
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.690
The sign in the notes went well.

145
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.490
Okay, sorry.

146
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:47.410
If stress is not equal to success, then there was an error and we want to return that error to the

147
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:47.860
user.

148
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.480
So we're going to say written.

149
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.590
Retard, retard, retard show.

150
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.310
Capital is within.

151
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.590
We didn't create that as a capital letter.

152
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.790
So this is going to be written shows that LA is going to take the risk.

153
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.750
That is the era.

154
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.860
Now.

155
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.350
We are having an issue with this contest.

156
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.860
Does not define is not defined nine.

157
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.350
That's is to get rid of this.

158
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.080
What we can do is we are going to provide this widget to states for widgets.

159
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.360
Already you can see the state less widgets.

160
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.300
So we are going to use control and does convert to state for widgets.

161
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.850
Probably you got that error as well.

162
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.270
But is how to solve it.

163
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.690
But at least he tried not to get to this point.

164
00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:36.890
Congrats.

165
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.760
Okay.

166
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.610
So if there is an error, we are going to do this else.

167
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.430
Really we don't have to do anything because they're going to log into user to the next page, probably

168
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.150
the home page.

169
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.410
So I think this is basically it's okay.

170
00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:01.730
So you just say do do nothing for now.

171
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.510
We don't want.

172
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.450
Okay.

173
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.600
We're just going to leave it that way.

174
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:08.890
Okay.

175
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.080
Now we're going to leave this field empty there.

176
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.910
Try to log in.

177
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.520
Okay.

178
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.190
Now, you can see we are making almost the same mistake.

179
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.430
We have not called this function.

180
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:21.720
Okay.

181
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.760
So now we're going to go to that.

182
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.660
Face.

183
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.160
That is a log in box in.

184
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.740
This is where.

185
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.550
Okay because Australia does get rid of all this.

186
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.380
Then you can see the log in.

187
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.750
Use this, okay.

188
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.930
Get rid of this.

189
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.510
You can't.

190
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.560
You cannot.

191
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:42.970
Okay.

192
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.070
Now let's try this.

193
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.240
Okay.

194
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.520
Now field's empty.

195
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.350
Okay, please.

196
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.650
Fields must not be empty.

197
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.730
Okay.

198
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.140
Now what you're going to do if you have forgotten the accounts you create.

199
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.380
You can also just create a new one now.

200
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.660
Then you can try this yourself.

201
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.190
I'm already percent sure that there's going to be no issue.

202
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.860
So you can just try it out yourself.

203
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.840
Then you're going to go check your.

204
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.380
The book also I think is a good great.

205
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:26.160
If the user has been successfully logged in, that is with updates to your TiVo console that you are

206
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.180
now logged in.

207
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.520
Right.

208
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:27.900
Okay.

209
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.060
Okay, guys, now you're going to do one more test for me before close this lecture.

210
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.700
What's it going to do is now correctly.

211
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.120
Sometimes when the user click a log in, it's going to take some time.

212
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.000
Right.

213
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.820
These I might not know what is going on if the account has to log in or not.

214
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.200
So what they're going to do is you're going to create a log in a loading spinner.

215
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.490
So to show the user that.

216
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.170
The account is being logged in, so that's what they're going to do.

217
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.830
So now do this in the last picture.

218
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.050
We're going to see you guys see this lecture.
