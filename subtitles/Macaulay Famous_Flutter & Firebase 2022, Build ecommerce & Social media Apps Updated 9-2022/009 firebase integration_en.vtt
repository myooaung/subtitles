00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.150
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.370
In this lecture, we're going to integrate Firebase.

4
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.720
Okay, now where you're going to need to search for Firebase, and we're going to click on the stress

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.990
link, which says Firebase at Google.

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.970
That's com slash firebase.

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.360
Okay.

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.550
Okay.

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.990
Okay.

10
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.770
Now, if for any reason you don't have an accounts, you can easily just create one.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.220
Okay.

12
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.990
And then after you're going to need to click on this go to console.

13
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.140
Okay.

14
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.650
Okay.

15
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.930
Okay.

16
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.410
Okay.

17
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.810
And over here, we're going to click on that project and we're going to call this project's Zoom Call

18
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.180
on.

19
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.580
I.

20
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.600
Okay.

21
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.620
Then continue.

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.760
Okay.

23
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.140
Now make sure you disable this.

24
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.080
We don't really need it.

25
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.680
Became creates projects.

26
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.970
And this is going to take some time creating your projects this way.

27
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.450
Okay.

28
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.690
And professional resources and.

29
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.320
You just have to wait for this.

30
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.690
Ack ack ack ack.

31
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.310
Finishing up.

32
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.690
Okay.

33
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.520
Okay, okay.

34
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.910
And now we are good to go.

35
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.640
Okay, now we can click on Continue.

36
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.750
Okay.

37
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.470
Let me take for Android.

38
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.970
So we are going to need to click on this and read.

39
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.930
Okay.

40
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.750
I can see the first field is asking for is the under it package name and that's it.

41
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.740
Get this package name.

42
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.980
What you can easily just do is over in this and you can see your package name is generally the application

43
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.560
ID in your hop level fields that great.

44
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.310
Okay not to get this we're going to need to go back to our code and then hundred.

45
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.460
Okay then happ level.

46
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.770
You can see why they have TiVo.

47
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.060
We have this view that greed.

48
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.510
Okay.

49
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.440
And over here, this is the application ID.

50
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.950
Okay.

51
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.980
Now, what we can do is we can easily just copy this.

52
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.810
Okay.

53
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.980
I think it is not going to be unique since we've never mine is going to be similar to yours.

54
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.229
So what we can do is we can make this unique by changing this example to our name.

55
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.030
So this sort of example we can say my colleague in was definitely this is going to be your name.

56
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.470
Okay.

57
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.690
So now we can use culture and to save this file and we can then copy this.

58
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.070
I'm sure.

59
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.670
And see.

60
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.430
And you can then start over.

61
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.120
Okay.

62
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.160
Now the next field is asking for is the hap nickname, which is optional.

63
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.330
So you can just zoom.

64
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.100
Zoom have learned not to use Google sign in or for authentication.

65
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.650
It is required to have the as a key they note together as a key.

66
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.390
What we can do is override this.

67
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.170
And you can see.

68
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.740
For information on using the keys to to get the eyes off your sinuses you can and so on.

69
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.090
Okay.

70
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.270
So what we can do is provide this again.

71
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.830
And with that, we're going to open this in a new tab.

72
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.310
Okay.

73
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.450
Now scroll down.

74
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.130
You can see we have this code for Mac liners and windows.

75
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.480
Okay.

76
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.270
If you own windows, you can easily just copy this code bosses one Linus will need to copy this.

77
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.930
Okay.

78
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.620
Copy this.

79
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.830
Contrary to see.

80
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.720
Then we're going to go back to Our Vinci Code and then seminary, new seminary.

81
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.260
And now we can paste this.

82
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.770
Okay.

83
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.020
Okay.

84
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.600
I guess he's asking for the password to get the password.

85
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.290
O'REILLY You can see the Keystone utility prompts you to enter a password for the keys to write.

86
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.060
The default password for the debug keys to is what, hundred?

87
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.390
So over here, we we're going to need to see Android.

88
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.400
Okay, great.

89
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.260
Now, this is the se1 key, so we can easily just copy this.

90
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.730
Copy.

91
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.830
And.

92
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.780
Over here.

93
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.610
We need to paste.

94
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.030
Okay.

95
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.560
Now, if you have an error, it might be you have some space.

96
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.780
Okay.

97
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.250
So they just get rid of that space and click on register half.

98
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.820
Okay.

99
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.450
Okay.

100
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.870
Okay.

101
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.230
Okay.

102
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.590
Okay.

103
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.950
Okay.

104
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.310
Okay.

105
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.700
Okay.

106
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.210
Okay.

107
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.410
Okay.

108
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.770
Now, the first step to do now is to download this.

109
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.120
Okay, click on this is this and you can see it wants us to have the adults in the what's under it have

110
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.620
mother roots directory.

111
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.980
Okay.

112
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.140
So to do this, we are going to need to go to our files and downloads.

113
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.030
And then we can call this we don't really need it anymore since it's just going to be specified to that

114
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.540
project.

115
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.010
Okay.

116
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.890
Xoom, Hap and Android.

117
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.110
Then hop there over the piers is over within 2 hours and that's great.

118
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.440
Okay.

119
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.020
And now we can click and nest.

120
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.610
You can just get rid of this.

121
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.130
Okay.

122
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.850
Now there you can see it wants us to heart this line.

123
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.240
Right.

124
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.740
And it was the saddest line in the project level, viewed that credo.

125
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.130
Okay.

126
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.750
So this we can just close this.

127
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.240
Okay.

128
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.590
So this is the top level, the Twitter, right?

129
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.690
And this is the project that will be the creator.

130
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.110
Okay.

131
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.490
So what we can do is we can copy this.

132
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.480
Okay.

133
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.000
And.

134
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.040
Is this okay?

135
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.500
Okay.

136
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.810
This country and this is safe.

137
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.190
Okay, great.

138
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.510
Now, this is all we need to co-sign in this.

139
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.330
Okay, so now we can screw down.

140
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.230
Over here, you can see it wants us to have this.

141
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.840
So on it, one side is in the words high level view, that's greater, right?

142
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.160
So we can copy this.

143
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.660
And this is the top level, right?

144
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.160
And this is a bit of guido.

145
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.520
So over here you can see we have this Uplay plugin.

146
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.900
You can basically had it in the way.

147
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.040
You can add it at the bottom as well.

148
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.540
Okay.

149
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.490
So it isn't too hard this.

150
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.440
Will they confront SC?

151
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.960
And over here you can see it also wants us to had this line and it was just added in where the level

152
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.050
creates a grid that is the same territory this imply we just added this so we can copy and.

153
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.910
Go down and obey the dependencies.

154
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.410
And I thought this began this country necessary.

155
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.800
Okay.

156
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.290
Now what we can also do.

157
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.450
We need to.

158
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.670
It's a great story.

159
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.200
We need to integrate, increased and many more.

160
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.520
Here's the question so you can get to the hero.

161
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.590
So to do that, I think we have that in the project level.

162
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.920
So this should be in the help level directory.

163
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.400
Okay.

164
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.680
Okay.

165
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.450
This at minimum is the key, but only integrates it.

166
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.840
Sorry.

167
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.800
Not integrated.

168
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.010
No.

169
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.090
I keep you integrate.

170
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.060
You're going to increase its to 21 for now.

171
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.450
Okay.

172
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.590
And now we can use contra in this to see.

173
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.290
Okay.

174
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.570
Okay.

175
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.670
This is basically all we need.

176
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.140
Okay.

177
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.440
And now we can click on next.

178
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.360
Okay.

179
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.500
Then go to console.

180
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:40.920
Okay.

181
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.820
Now you're going to be integrated in Google, right?

182
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.590
So all we need to do is we need to enable it.

183
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.520
So in a way, it's we're going to go to this authentication tab and.

184
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.020
Then we're going to need to click on Get Started.

185
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.890
And.

186
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.880
Okay.

187
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.930
Okay.

188
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.510
You can come to the sign provider.

189
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.850
Okay.

190
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.540
And then Google.

191
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.870
We want a little Google drive so you can click on enable.

192
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.320
Okay.

193
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.040
Now I can see is asking for the project public facing.

194
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.600
I cannot to see what this does.

195
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.390
You can this is just over in this and you can see this a bit and then presented to the user when they

196
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.760
are shown and the public distance of your project.

197
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.690
For example, this will be the name displayed on emails that your users received after creating an account

198
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.320
which you have.

199
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.309
Okay, now I think you know what this does.

200
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:39.750
So we can call this, we can just say Zoom app, okay?

201
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.990
And you can see project supports mail.

202
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.120
Just going to use the mail attached to this account.

203
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.590
Okay.

204
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.580
And now we can click on Save.

205
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.500
Okay.

206
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.520
Okay.

207
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:55.750
Okay.

208
00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:03.760
Now, lastly, in order to use in order to integrate Google, we also don't need the it's a process

209
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:10.390
we recently had the issue one boat as well we need to has a 50 states I can also add that are going

Okay.

212
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.930
Then over here, we're going to need to click on Add Fingerprint.

213
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.850
We can observe.

214
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.220
We can.

215
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.380
Yes, we copy that code.

216
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.890
Okay.

217
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.480
I'm using.

218
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.820

Okay.

222
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.350
Now we're going to copy this to a ticket to see.

223
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.190
Now, what you can do is you can easily have this copied somewhere.

224
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.960
Right.

225
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:54.160
Because any time you want to integrate Google and fortification, you basically need this to.

226
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.880
Okay.

227
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.200
So we can then his this overear.

228
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.220
And safe.

229
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.580
You can see it automatically detect it for any reason.

230
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.230
Have an error.

231
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:05.980
It could.

232
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.440
It could be because you have maybe some space over there how to beginning a case and make sure you don't

233
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.020
have in the space and click on Save.

Okay, great.

235
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:24.280
Now, this is basically all you need in order to integrate Firebase and in order to do what it's to

236
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.080
get integrate Google.

237
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.640
So we have set up everything we need.

238
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.020
Okay.

239
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.450
So now in this picture, they're going to start integrating the Google assigning methods.

240
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:34.840
Okay.

241
