00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.589
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.200
Now, what we are going to be doing this lecture is whenever a user clicks on any of this store, we

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.490
want to take that user to that seller store where that seller products are going to be displayed.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.220
Okay.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
Now, to do this, we have to create a new file for this.

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.690
And we are going to create this new file in the minor screen's dietary over a new file.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.270
And we are going to call this file visits on the score store, on the score screen, and then the section

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.250
is dot dot and we can just go with the stateless widget, the last widget and visit.

10
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.210
Visit.

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.460
Store then screen and over here we need a light and use control and also imports the material that that

12
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.430
package and for now we can get rid of this and for now we can get rid of this side and just have a color.

13
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.950
This is going to be closed side.

14
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.390
Okay.

15
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.850
Is control necessary?

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.310
Now, when we click on this, we want to go to the screen.

17
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.710
To do that, we have to head back to the store screen.

18
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.610
And while you can see we are basically returning a container, so we are basically returning a column

19
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.270
widget.

20
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.910
And within the column widget we have a size box and you can see it has the chart of clip rates, then

21
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.620
image the network.

22
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.470
And also we also do have this test widget.

23
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.440
Now what we are going to do is when we click on this.

24
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.630
We want to go to that screen.

25
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.200
Right.

26
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.860
To do that, we have to wrap this column with a button.

27
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.230
Okay.

28
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.910
A light and use control and dots and wrap with widgets.

29
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.940
And we can just wrap this with the gesture detector.

30
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.600
And of course, you could also wrap this with an inkwell.

31
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.470
And since it also has a property known as on tap.

32
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.090
Okay.

33
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.940
And now what we have to do is to say Navigator Dot's push.

34
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.100
Okay.

35
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.910
And it has a property known as contest and it is also expected in something known as Materia page rules.

36
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.300
So via materia page.

37
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.300
Roots.

38
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.950
The view there is going to take in contests and all we just have to do is to.

39
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.690
How do you change your semicolon over your first?

40
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.780
And we are going to return the visit store screen.

41
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.470
Okay.

42
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.750
And now we have to start.

43
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.910
All three starting.

44
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.590
It's going to take some time to reach that.

45
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.140
Okay.

46
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.100
Okay.

47
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.810
Take your time to start.

48
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.360
And now we can go check this out.

49
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.550
Okay.

50
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.600
It's going to take us back to the cell login screen and.

51
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.610
Same loss stare at email did calm.

52
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.380
And password B and C and click on log in.

53
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.210
Okay.

54
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.500
And shut up.

55
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.480
Or you can just rename that store and I'm going to click on this.

56
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.220
You can see so close to this new screen called visit store.

57
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.060
Okay.

58
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.490
Now, what we want to do is.

59
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.450
We want to have a harbor of a year where the name of the store is going to be displayed.

60
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.860
To do this, we are going to be using a future view there.

61
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.700
Now head back to your browser and open a new tab.

62
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.050
And over here we are going to search for flow to fire.

63
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.750
Follow the sci fi and click on this firebase dot.

64
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.339
Sorry this aware flutter file view.

65
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.560
Basically the same thing.

66
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.280
And over here, we are going to search for one time, reload one time.

67
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.460
One time.

68
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.240
Read this.

69
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.320
Click on this.

70
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.670
Okay.

71
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.360
Great.

72
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.970
And for this, we are going to be using a future leader.

73
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.230
Right.

74
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.750
You basically know what a future be the doors and you can see to read a collection or documents once.

75
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.340
Right.

76
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.280
And hopefully you remember what it does now.

77
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.900
Okay.

78
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.700
And what we have to do is.

79
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.350
We are going to copy from this point of view.

80
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.580
This point and it hands over your rights.

81
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.690
Use concurrency to copy and back to your visa code and we have to get rid of this return.

82
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.260
Right.

83
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.300
And face this.

84
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.190
You can see we have all these errors and it's because we need to import it over here.

85
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.850
We have to allow it and use control and also import that.

86
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.010
Okay.

87
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.520
And this is basically it.

88
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.220
Well, this time around, we want to search the seller's.

89
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.490
We want to fetch data from the seller's collection.

90
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.610
Right, because we want the store name to be displayed over here.

91
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.260
Okay.

92
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.850
To do that, we have to change this name to say.

93
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.650
Seller rights sellers.

94
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.170
I think that is the name of our collection.

95
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.600
Sellers.

96
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.870
Right.

97
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.440
Okay.

98
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.880
And we can also rename this to, say, seller.

99
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.400
Right.

100
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.290
And this is going to be seller.

101
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.610
Right, sailor.

102
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.580
Doc Doc Ock, and this is basically it.

103
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.180
Well, now what we have to do is we are only going to be displaying.

104
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.920
So we go back.

105
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:26.810
When we click on this, we want to display the store name of that seller over here.

106
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.760
So to do that, we have to pass the seller uid to the screen.

107
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:39.830
Now, over here we are going to create a finer and we are going to call this maybe.

108
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.590
Seller.

109
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.020
You hide?

110
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.050
Okay.

111
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.770
And now we have to highlight and use control and control and dots create constructor for final fields

112
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.190
and you can see it automatically made this required.

113
00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.410
And so wherever we are calling this resistor, we have to pass the value to that.

114
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:09.020
And you can see why in the stock screen we are calling that screen right visitor visits so screen.

115
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.790
So we have to pass the value to this and for the value.

116
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.580
It's going to be snapshot dot.

117
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.470
That data.

118
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.740
I think we need that in the docs and we want to assess each of them.

119
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.650
By the Indians.

120
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.520
And over here I think we have a field within the products.

121
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.090
Called Seller uid.

122
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.080
Okay.

123
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.050
Okay.

124
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.350
I think we have that.

125
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.060
Come.

126
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.430
So not products would sell as.

127
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:55.860
Yeah.

128
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.240
We have the seller's uid seller uid.

129
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.870
Okay.

130
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.580
Okay.

131
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.860
This is going to be seller.

132
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.990
Make sure you don't have any spelling mistake.

133
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.540
And over here, we need another check.

134
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.390
And hopefully you're not confused if you are.

135
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.000
You can do.

136
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.940
Also, please let me know.

137
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.020
Okay.

138
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.490
It's necessary.

139
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.340
And back to.

140
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:23.290
The visitor, and we have to get rid of this.

141
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.510
And this is going to be the cellar.

142
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.560
Uid.

143
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.450
It's okay.

144
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.200
We could have said maybe five days.

145
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.480
Right, Firebase.

146
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:44.520
Does Firebase ODS those comments is that Firebase or that kind of instance?

147
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:52.560
That comment is definitely, you know, what this is going to do, then maybe that's your ID, right?

148
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.580
What this is what this is going to do is it's going to just get the current logged in user.

149
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.810
So even when you click on order.

150
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.850
On other store.

151
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.520
Your name is going to be displayed there because this will basically get the current logged in user.

152
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:17.140
So what we are simply doing is we are passing that that seller or the product of that seller to this

153
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.760
screen.

154
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.260
Right.

155
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.590
Okay.

156
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.630
Hopefully understand.

157
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.640
And if you don't, you can please let me know.

158
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.110
Okay.

159
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.020
So this is going to be seller.

160
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.920
Uid.

161
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.310
Right.

162
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:36.910
Sell your ID, this is basically it and use control and B to make this wide and you can just get rid

163
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.190
of this on used imports.

164
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.700
Okay.

165
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.590
And after successfully retrieving the data and you can see where we have available to store those data.

166
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.550
So via.

167
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:57.090
I think we've done this from scratch already before we have been able to store the data.

168
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.760
Right.

169
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.420
Okay.

170
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.580
And this is only just a test.

171
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.830
We can return the scaffold.

172
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.110
Scaffold.

173
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.370
And this scaffold is going to have a have an upper harbor.

174
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:15.650
Okay.

175
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.790
I think we need an additional parenthesis and this is going to be this.

176
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:26.920
And as you know, the harbor the harbor has a property which you don't know.

177
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:27.530
Yes.

178
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.090
Known as to bar heights.

179
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.410
And we can set this to under it and not to go see what it does.

180
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.670
Okay.

181
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.920
Okay.

182
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.990
So we start this.

183
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.390
They can do it again.

184
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:54.100
You can see now we have the harbor and you can see it's a bit wider because of this two by height.

185
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:54.750
Okay.

186
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.920
And now we can then have the.

187
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.640
The title of the harbor.

188
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.500
And this is going to be a test that.

189
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.380
And this is going to be data.

190
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.830
Then we want to assess the store name.

191
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.340
You can see what's in this.

192
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.040
We have the store name.

193
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.460
Right.

194
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:17.990
Okay.

195
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.550
Okay.

196
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.380
So then.

197
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.350
Use control necessary and you're going to see the wire.

198
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.830
Okay, Mark.

199
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.280
John.

200
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.450
Great.

201
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.690
And we can increase the font size.

202
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.180
By center star and font size.

203
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.010
Since before.

204
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.300
And with.

205
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:50.990
Frankly.

206
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.340
That board.

207
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.300
So.

208
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.190
Not for style, but fun with.

209
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.080
It was going to be fun with the board.

210
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.100
Okay.

211
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.050
Great.

212
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.590
Is Katrina necessary?

213
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.940
Okay.

214
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.510
Okay.

215
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.320
Sounds cool.

216
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.170
Cisco, right.

217
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.610
And what we could also do.

218
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:32.420
Okay.

219
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.830
Sorry, you could also.

220
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:42.810
Maybe later specs and there's going to be maybe six to spread the letters around.

221
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.010
Okay.

222
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.330
And for the above background color, we can change.

223
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.860
This is a broken color.

224
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.900
This is going to be colors assign.

225
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.510
Okay.

226
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:06.660
Okay.

227
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.350
Sounds cool.

228
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.870
And hopefully we don't get confused.

229
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.230
Okay.

230
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.730
I'm going to show you this again.

231
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:19.540
You can see over here in the store screen what we basically do was to retrieve a.

232
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.650
The seller writes, I remember the seller is referring to the store.

233
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.230
Right.

234
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.930
Okay.

235
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.800
And that was what we basically did over there to retrieve.

236
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.640
So retrieve the cellar.

237
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.700
Right.

238
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.920
Okay, then when we click on this.

239
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.030
We want to go to that silver screen, right?

240
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:53.750
So what we have to do was to pass the seller uid to that new screen, right.

241
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.580
And to do that, the first step was to create a variable.

242
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.450
Over here creates a finite variable and we make this variable required.

243
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:13.420
And the reason for this is so whenever we call this this store, we have to pass the value to that variable

244
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.680
called seller uid.

245
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.090
And you can see over here we are simply calling that.

246
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.220
That screen.

247
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.050
Writes Court of Visit Store.

248
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:31.920
So we have to then pass the value to it and we are basically passing the seller.

249
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.450
UID Right.

250
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.570
Remember I said instead of this?

251
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.100
We could have said, okay, let's just do this.

252
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.200
Firebase Auth.

253
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:53.070
Dot's insistence that current user ID what this would do is it would get.

254
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.480
Use the comment logged in user and that should be you.

255
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.310
Okay.

256
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.460
Now let's see this.

257
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.140
You can see famous store.

258
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.810
Wherever we go is going to be famous store.

259
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.050
You can see families.

260
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:08.710
And.

261
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.730
Tim Lester.

262
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.270
So this is what is going to get you.

263
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.780
The COVID lockdown is right, but we do not want that.

264
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:25.260
So what we have to do was to pass the seller uid to the screen and hopefully you understand this, but

265
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.830
if you don't, you can please do well to let me know.

266
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.410
Okay.

267
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.320
You can say test source in school.

268
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.190
Tester.

269
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:33.440
Okay.

270
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.360
Now, you can see we have this is loading something.

271
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.800
It looks very weird.

272
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.940
Okay, slow down.

273
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.340
So it's not it's loading, but loading.

274
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:42.990
Okay.

275
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.920
And this is it over here, right?

276
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:51.670
So what we can do is we can wrap this with a material which is very similar to that of the scaffold.

277
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:57.160
Or you can just wrap this with a scaffold like wrap what we did, and we're going to wrap this with

278
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.180
a material.

279
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.870
This would give us a material.

280
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.370
This would give us that white default background.

281
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.540
I think it's okay.

282
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.200
And this test.

283
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.440
We are.

284
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.560
We are going to have a circular progress indicator, not it says secular.

285
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.520
Secular, secular, secular, secular progress indicator.

286
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.680
And we're going to give you a color to this caller's does sign.

287
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.030
Close a sign.

288
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.570
Okay.

289
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.910
And I think we are missing additional and it's unnecessary.

290
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.030
And also what we can then do is we can take this to the center.

291
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.050
Okay.

292
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.140
And.

293
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.840
Back.

294
00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.850
Click on this.

295
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:00.580
Okay.

296
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.620
Sims could.

297
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.040
Right.

298
00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:11.020
And what we are basically saying is if snapshot condition status is equal to dumb.

299
00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:17.030
If he does finish low, then we basically want to retrieve this, right?

300
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.060
Else if it is still low, then we want to return a material.

301
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.579
To have that white background, like I said, is very similar to that of the scaffold, right?

302
00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:31.740
Well, most of the time you would want to use a scaffold in order to have assets in lots of property.

303
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.490
Right.

304
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:37.830
And we are basically having a child and the center we get to center the Circular Progress Indicator

305
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.610
and we have this color of the sign and hopefully understand this.

306
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.950
And if you don't, you can please do well to let me know.

307
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.590
And I think it's working as expected.

308
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.050
Okay.

309
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.110
Then in the next lecture we are going to display the products of that seller by.
