00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.060
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.120
In this lecture, we are going to start working on the seller's account.

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.780
Okay, now, over this odd territory, we are going to create a new PHI and we're going to call this

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.190
Phi London on the score seller, on the score screen.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.550
And this section is door darts.

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.760
Okay.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.660
The London seller screen is going to look very similar to that of the London customer screen.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.520
So what we can do, we can head out to the London customer screen and then we can use concur and hate

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.640
so alight and use control and see the copy and head back to the London cost sorry London seller screen

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.480
and we can then use control and V to paste this.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.260
Okay.

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.960
And what we have to do now is to rename it.

14
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.550
You can just use control and to make this wide and over here we can alight and use control and D So

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.550
I like all the similar words.

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.210
Okay.

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.600
And we can then rename this to London.

18
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.960
Seller screen.

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.450
Okay, you can see why we created a verb already called root name.

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.030
And we are saying the name of the root is London Silver Screen.

21
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.460
Okay.

22
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.460
So it's good, right?

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.260
And we're going to be using another way to sign up the user.

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.050
And the reason for and the reason for this is so you understand multiple ways in order to sign up users.

25
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.270
Okay.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.260
So this is the first way over the London customers screen.

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.210
What we basically did was to.

28
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.740
Create the functionality to sign up users over the controllers.

29
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.710
There are three and then the odd controller.

30
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.740
Okay.

31
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.230
So in this section we are going to use a bit different way to sign up users.

32
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.790
And like I said, the reason for this is so you understand multiple ways on how to implement source.

33
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.320
Okay, so what we can then do over the land in customer sorry land is sell a screen.

34
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.460
And you try and be we can just get rid of this.

35
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.590
We are not going to be using this pattern.

36
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.020
Get rid of this.

37
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.940
And maybe this as well.

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.460
Okay.

39
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.300
We're definitely going to have that era.

40
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.740
And we want to be able to pick image from.

41
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.750
Yeah, I think we need that.

42
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.350
We need the controller.

43
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.080
Remember the remote controller, we created the functionality to pick image, right?

44
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.470
So we are basically having assets to the class.

45
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.980
Then the function called peak image.

46
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.330
So we need that.

47
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.760
And we're going to have this error because the race is not defined.

48
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.530
Okay.

49
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.370
I'm just going to delete this function.

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.540
The latest.

51
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.340
Okay.

52
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
And yeah.

53
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.490
Click on this and get rid of this controller.

54
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.140
I'm going to show you another way to do this.

55
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.830
The hurry.

56
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.630
Okay.

57
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.460
And get rid of this.

58
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.230
And get rid of this.

59
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.550
And.

60
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.940
Get rid of this function over here.

61
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.610
Okay.

62
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.530
Simms Good.

63
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.660
Seems good.

64
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:31.050
And now we can then head back to the London customer screen use country and B and sorry.

65
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:39.570
We also do have to sell that file that we had created this route or via.

66
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.640
Yeah.

67
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.050
Right.

68
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.760
Okay, so back to the main ..5.

69
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.080
And over here you can see I've set the initial routes back to the London customer screen.

70
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.840
So via this is going to be London.

71
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.120
London cellar.

72
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.750
London cellar door.

73
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.500
What roots name?

74
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.050
I think some people pronounce this as the roots and.

75
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.730
Contest then this.

76
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.839
And we basically want to assess the London cellar.

77
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.079
Sorry, London.

78
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.250
Seller.

79
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.790
It's Korean.

80
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.340
Okay.

81
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.930
Great.

82
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.610
Okay, comma, use control and save and add back to.

83
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.190
The London customer screened London customer screen.

84
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.410
And.

85
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.320
And where we have the create customize account.

86
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.440
Okay.

87
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.490
Where we have this creates a seller's account, so create a seller's account.

88
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.940
And over here we are going to send navigator darts.

89
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.790
Instead of pushing a series of push, we are going to push name because it is a name route or a name

90
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.380
route like you can see it's asking for the route name or the routes name.

91
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.800
Okay.

92
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.450
It's this London.

93
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.370
London.

94
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.660
London.

95
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.800
London.

96
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.640
Silver.

97
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.480
London cellar.

98
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.980
London cellar screen.

99
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:39.320
I'm just waiting for all to prediction Dot Root's name and we need this over here and give this a heart

100
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.410
we start.

101
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.840
Waiting for all three started.

102
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.250
And we are definitely going to be able to see this.

103
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.910
Okay.

104
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.620
And back to.

105
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.660
I think it's faster to start this and click on Sign Up Now.

106
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.830
Okay.

107
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.020
We don't even know if it has gone.

108
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.910
Okay, we have to change the test.

109
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.410
Right.

110
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.930
Okay.

111
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.690
Over the London silver screen.

112
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.030
We have to then change the test.

113
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.300
This is going to be create a seller's account.

114
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.410
Sellers.

115
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.520
Seller's accounts is contrary and safe and hopefully we are currently in that screen.

116
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.330
Okay.

117
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:39.390
Create seller's account or probably we might say create a seller's account.

118
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.810
I think this looks nice.

119
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.970
Okay, great.

120
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.220
And the functionality of picking image is still there.

121
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.680
The phone and the email and password functionality.

122
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.770
We basically just copy the code.

123
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.140
Okay.

124
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:04.850
Now, what you're going to do is you're going to create a new file for the London login screen.

125
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.190
London seller's screen, sorry, seller's log in screen.

126
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.730
Right.

127
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.140
So you're going to create the login for that and you basically just need to copy all this code.

128
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.200
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
