00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.440
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.970
In this lecture, we are going to make the category name clickable, but before then, you can see we

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.970
have one, two, three, four, five, five category names and yet we still do have this big greenish

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.780
background.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.880
And the reason for this is because you can see over here we created a container and we said the height

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.070
is going to be 80%.

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.230
That is from year to year and over year.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.070
We said the width is going to be 20% of the screen.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.170
That's this from here.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.000
So yeah, but what we can also do, we can make the color suits, how many category names we have.

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.510
In order to do that, we have to get rid of this color we have in the container.

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.530
We use control and save and definitely is going to be white.

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
OC And over here it's the freestanding is size box.

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.080
We are going to return a container widget and the reason for this is because we basically want to have

16
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.960
assets to the colors property and over here we can then say color colors.

17
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.180
Starts grey the shade 300 years controller and that's the save now.

18
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.660
And you can see now the background color suits.

19
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.730
Just how many?

20
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.330
Category name we have and instead of container, we can just change this to size box which is similar

21
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.640
to that of the container.

22
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.490
And the reason we are changing this to size box is because we basically do not need assets to the colors

23
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.250
property.

24
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.640
So we do not need to have a lot of containers containers.

25
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.040
Okay, great.

26
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.470
If it is going to work just similar.

27
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.620
And now what we can do is we can make this category name clickable.

28
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.720
To do this, we are going to do some.

29
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.220
Some beats.

30
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.060
Tricky.

31
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.840
Tense.

32
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.970
Okay.

33
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.400
And over here, we're going to create a class and we are going to call this class item data.

34
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.560
And over a year, we're going to.

35
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.620
Creates up to two variables.

36
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.250
Yes.

37
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.450
String.

38
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.120
And this is going to be for the category.

39
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.770
Category.

40
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.840
Name.

41
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.390
They?

42
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.710
And we are going to create a bull, which is basically a false value and we're going to call this is

43
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.930
selected to know basically what category name we are clicking.

44
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.380
Okay.

45
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.870
And now we have to pass it on to the constructor.

46
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.110
So via you can then create item data and add this and the first field that is the category name is going

47
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.130
to be required.

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.110
And we have to say this that.

49
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.820
Cuts are going in and for the order variable, which is either true of a false value.

50
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.450
We have to say this dot selected and we're going to give it a default value of force.

51
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.580
Okay.

52
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.540
And instead of this list we have via.

53
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.530
We are going to change this string to the high temp data class.

54
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.960
And definitely we are going to have this era because it is expecting this to feels right.

55
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.010
It's basically a split in this string category name because we made this required.

56
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.090
So anytime we call this item data it is expecting would pass the value to this variable.

57
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.410
But for this, you can see really have a value in it.

58
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.120
That is the force value.

59
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.190
And over here.

60
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.030
We can then say item, item data.

61
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.010
And we have to parse the category name and we're going to call this man the newcomer.

62
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.290
And basically, we can just copy this and here's this and pays this and pays this and pays this like

63
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.650
his contract, this saved.

64
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.710
And we're going to call this we're going to call this women and we're going to call this other newcomer.

65
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.320
And we're going to call this she's.

66
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.540
And this is going to be key and maybe box.

67
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.130
Okay.

68
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.400
And now we're going to have this error.

69
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.970
And the reason for this error, you can see we have to fill over here.

70
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.320
So it is trying to know the particular field we want.

71
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.320
So here after assessing the you can see we have this variable called item, right?

72
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.910
So we have to say we want to assess the category name.

73
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.760
Okay, we have thought we start this.

74
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.280
If not, you might get an error.

75
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.070
Or we start in.

76
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.950
And this would take some time.

77
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.570
So what we start?

78
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.910
Okay.

79
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.600
You can see we have this error, so we have to start.

80
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.170
That's a get rid of that error.

81
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.700
Okay.

82
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.940
Okay.

83
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.630
And category.

84
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.170
Category.

85
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.400
Okay.

86
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.250
You can see men, women choose kids and bags.

87
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.340
Okay, now we're going to make this clickable.

88
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.300
Right to do that over this container.

89
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.100
We're going to wrap it to the bottom.

90
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.380
And as you know, we have different type of button.

91
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.810
But before then, we need to wrap this with a widget and it's going to be a type of inkwell as well.

92
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.490
We can you can grab this with it.

93
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.220
It just showed detector.

94
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.190
And the hinge has a property known as the on tab, same as the gesture detector.

95
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.090
And over here we are going to need to set a date that is to update the UI to something else.

96
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.870
And we are basically going to update the we basically want to update the this gray color that is the

97
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.370
selected color to white.

98
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.900
To do that, we have to set state that is updating the UI.

99
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.250
And in order to update the UI, we have to use a state for widgets.

100
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.150
So what we can do is over here we can alight and use control dots and converts to state for widgets.

101
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.590
Okay, now we have access to the set state property.

102
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.750
And over here we can then set state.

103
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.030
Said State and you can see the effort.

104
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.970
We said this is selected.

105
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.230
It's going to have the color of it's going to have the value of force.

106
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.280
So why once once it is clicked, once any of this item is clicked, that is any of this category name

107
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.020
is clicks.

108
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.710
We are going to have data that is selected to to true.

109
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.370
To do that, you can see why we have the high time.

110
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.900
Item, write the underscore item, which basically has access to all the data the item data has.

111
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.140
And basically the item data has just to variables that is a category name and is selected.

112
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:39.380
So to assess this is selected, we have to cover this, this item over here so we can then say on the

113
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.630
score item.

114
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.940
Then intense because we basically have to seal.

115
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.990
Where was their right and want to assess this selected and we basically want to turn it to true.

116
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.120
Once it is clicked.

117
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.690
Okay.

118
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:57.880
Great.

119
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.470
I think we need this over there and over here, over this color.

120
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.540
We can then have a check.

121
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.060
We can then say on the score item.

122
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.030
Then in Dan's thoughts.

123
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:20.720
Is selected if it is selected, is equal to is equal to true, and therefore default sets to false,

124
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.290
right.

125
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.910
Whenever we click on any of the category, name is going to be equal to true.

126
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.420
Right?

127
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.290
If it is equal to true, we want a colors.

128
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:37.030
Of white else if it is not equal to true that is that is if it is not yet clicked.

129
00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.970
We just want to have this colors that gray.

130
00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.620
And what we have to do now is to hard.

131
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.390
We start.

132
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.810
Okay.

133
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.090
This is basically it.

134
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.210
But we starting.

135
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.530
And go check it out.

136
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.770
We'll check it out and click on this.

137
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.150
You can see.

138
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.560
Sounds good, right?

139
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.200
Okay.

140
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.010
And Emily, we keep having a lot of category names.

141
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.590
The caller is going to respond to that.

142
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.120
Okay.

143
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.830
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
