00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.600
Hi.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.560
In this lecture, I want to start working on the categories.

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:04.950
Okay.

5
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.500
Now, over this widget directory, we are going to create a new PHI and be able to codify category for

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.640
this core item.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.470
Then the addiction starts.

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.590
And now we can then use instead less widgets.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.290
And as well we can call this category.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.700
I can.

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.370
Then we can alight and use the control and not important, but rather that package.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.090
We can take this category item fly as the design for each single category.

13
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.530
Okay.

14
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.470
Now in the future, they're going to Visa's management provider.

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.120
So in order to make our code much cleaner and concise, what we are going to do is we can create a list

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.550
to store our category image and as well the category name.

17
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.060
Okay.

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.310
To do that, I will do this over here.

19
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.400
I want to say it is a type of list.

20
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.630
Then my.

21
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.980
And then.

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.300
There's also a type of drink and also a type of object that we don't know.

23
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.050
What is object?

24
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.620
Object is something that has a property name and a property value.

25
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.650
You can say you are a man and you have a property such as I or what makes you a man is referred to as

26
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.090
what's your property value?

27
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.940
Right.

28
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.310
Okay.

29
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.380
And now they're going to have to do it again.

30
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.990
And then we can't call this.

31
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.990
Categories.

32
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.620
Right.

33
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.270
Okay, great.

34
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.470
Have you seen the cold?

35
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.670
Now the first property name is going to be the category.

36
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.570
Category name.

37
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.140
Right.

38
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.360
Then we can say it is sorry.

39
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.960
It is the object, right?

40
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.539
These are objects.

41
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.110
Or we also need this.

42
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.280
Okay.

43
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.330
So the first object will need, or the first property name we need is the category name of security

44
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.740
name.

45
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.930
Then the property value is what's false.

46
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.570
That is the false default defaults category.

47
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.620
Okay.

48
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.530
Yoda we need is the category image.

49
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.770
So you can see a category image.

50
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.770
They will need to specify the parts, assets, such images.

51
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.380
So it is going to check this out.

52
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.760
Okay.

53
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.640
I will go to my assets images.

54
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.390
You're going to see this images of the resource.

55
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.720
Okay.

56
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.650
Cuts across the PNG, right?

57
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.010
Sue Katz.

58
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.630
Cuts holes.

59
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.820
The PGA.

60
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.270
All right.

61
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.670
Okay.

62
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.230
Great.

63
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:23.440
Now we can actually come out of this this is a first objects because the property name so we can then

64
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.380
of another.

65
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.960
Okay.

66
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.350
As well.

67
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.820
Category is these more?

68
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.250
See?

69
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.000
Small.

70
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.360
See?

71
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.430
Okay.

72
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.060
I think.

73
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.990
See?

74
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.690
See?

75
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.450
Okay.

76
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.460
Category.

77
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.450
Name.

78
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.880
Right is going to be.

79
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.420
Close.

80
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.730
Okay.

81
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.900
And.

82
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.220
Category.

83
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.590
Image.

84
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.130
And this is going to be.

85
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.850
I think cuts close.

86
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.390
Assets slash.

87
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.250
Images slash.

88
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.500
Cuts.

89
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.019
Hot.

90
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.770
Close.

91
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.370
That's.

92
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.170
G.

93
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.670
P g.

94
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.110
Okay.

95
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.370
I did try to cover.

96
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.120
We can then just copy this.

97
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.780
I don't want a copy because I want you to master the process.

98
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.370
That was what I.

99
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.000
But at least you know by now.

100
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.530
Okay.

101
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.030
This can be the laptop category.

102
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.650
Laptop.

103
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.360
Laptop.

104
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.780
Hopefully I can still.

105
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.470
Okay.

106
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.530
Considering them, then the image is going to be I think we have cast ourselves.

107
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.740
That's.

108
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.020
The tops.

109
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.210
And this is.

110
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.410
P and G.

111
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.020
I think we can also of what issues?

112
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.340
So you can paste the category name.

113
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.610
It's going to be shoes.

114
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.270
Okay.

115
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.650
Shoes and.

116
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.510
It would be cuts shoes.

117
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.570
Cookie cutter shoes.

118
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.170
Cashews.

119
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.790
You can have as many as you want.

120
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.430
You can copy this as well.

121
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.520
And it's going to be.

122
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.760
What's key is going to be watch.

123
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.930
Watch.

124
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.640
Okay.

125
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.950
You can guess that this for the images is going to be with these cards.

126
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.730
Watch this.

127
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.140
Okay, great.

128
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.500
Okay.

129
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.050
You can do as many as you want.

130
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.320
So this is the Hodgetts, the property name.

131
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.850
This is the property value.

132
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.050
Right.

133
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.380
Okay, so now we have four categories.

134
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.110
One, two, two, four.

135
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.500
Okay.

136
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.520
Five.

137
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.230
I think this is okay for now.

138
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.340
The image is going to be in the resource of this lecture resource.

139
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.560
So make sure you get it.

140
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.440
Get it right.

141
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.790
Okay.

142
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.490
And you can add as many as you want.

143
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.460
Those are for you, for nature, beauty.

144
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.990
And when you're just.

145
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.390
What are you guys seeing in this picture?
