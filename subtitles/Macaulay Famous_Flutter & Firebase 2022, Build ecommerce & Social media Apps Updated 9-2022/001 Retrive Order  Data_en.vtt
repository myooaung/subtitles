00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.880
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.320
In this section, we are going to be able to retrieve our customer orders.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.610
To do this, we have to go back to our VTS code.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.760
And what we can do is we send the inner screens that re we can create a new file and we are going to

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.100
call this customer.

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.230
Customer.

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.570
Customer.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.110
Hopefully I can spare a customer.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.270
OC class summer.

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
On the score other on the score screen and though the.

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.070
Okay.

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.090
Okay.

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.340
And we are going to be using the distributor in order to retrieve customer orders.

15
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.200
So what we can do is we can head back to our browser and head up to.

16
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.520
Head up to Firebase Flow to the dead.

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.780
And over here we are going to search for the one time.

18
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.650
One time such one time read.

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.450
And that's who gets to that page.

20
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.060
Well, basically, we need the read time changes, but the one time rate is basically referring to the

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.980
future bidder.

22
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.710
Right.

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.760
This is where we have the future bidder.

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.050
So what we can do is we can copy the entire code and back to our VTS code and we are going to paste

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.410
this over.

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.960
Okay.

27
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.120
Definitely we are going to have all these errors.

28
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.210
So what we have to do is to alight and use control and dot in order to import those package.

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.800
Okay.

30
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.280
I think have not done this for some time now, and that is why it is delaying.

31
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.340
Look, I'm just going to do this again.

32
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.380
Contrary, not.

33
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.840
Okay.

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.570
Okay.

35
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.140
Okay.

36
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.710
What we can do to solve this, we can close this first.

37
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.360
And.

38
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.889
Yeah.

39
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.960
And.

40
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.160
And open it again.

41
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.840
Okay.

42
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.200
A light now and use control.

43
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.300
And that seems cool.

44
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.070
And also we need to impart the material that that file sorry, the material to that package.

45
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.410
And now we have to rename this.

46
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.500
You can highlight and use controlled DX in order to allow similar names.

47
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.580
And we are going to call this customer order screen.

48
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.130
Okay.

49
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.100
Sorry.

50
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.110
What's going on to this customer older skewing.

51
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.890
Okay.

52
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.050
He's going to try and beat to make this wide.

53
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.120
And remember the string is basically referring to the source of the data.

54
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.930
So what we can do is we can get rid of this over here and also get rid of this over here.

55
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.040
And over here we are then going to say firebase.

56
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.870
Firebase.

57
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.320
Faster, faster.

58
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.310
The distance.

59
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.580
Does collection and the name of the collection we want to assess is the oldest collection.

60
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.720
And now we have the stand, say the snapshots.

61
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.230
What this will basically do is it's going to get us all the orders we have in the order collection,

62
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.180
including orders made by other users.

63
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.350
But what we simply want is we want to get the order based on the side of the user.

64
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.100
To do this, we have to use a filter over it and we can say Dot where and you can see it's asking for

65
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.970
the name of the field.

66
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.020
The name of the field.

67
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.960
The name of the field is called PSI CID.

68
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.560
And remember, the CID is basically referring to the UID of the user.

69
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.810
So what we can then do, we can then save for our Firebase auth in order to get the current logged in

70
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.410
user.

71
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.460
So we are basically getting the comment logged in user who made that order.

72
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.960
Okay.

73
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.850
So is equal to.

74
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.100
Firebase Auth.

75
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.620
But that instance, those comments user, then those did.

76
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.580
And over here, we need a no check.

77
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.100
Okay.

78
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.140
Basically, you can just create a variable to store that as well.

79
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.840
You really do not need to do it over here.

80
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.680
You can just go with that way and hopefully understand what I'm trying to say.

81
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.400
Okay.

82
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.780
Use control and save.

83
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.580
And if it has error, we are going to return this test which says something went wrong.

84
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.920
We can just enter this rapid center and if it is trying to fetch the data, we want to return a material.

85
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.630
And that's what I have.

86
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.430
That's why it's nice background.

87
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.990
And you can then have a child.

88
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.370
The child is going to be a sensor.

89
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.210
Which widget?

90
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.710
And we can then have another child, which is going to be a cycle of progress, indicates a cycle of

91
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.710
progress indicator and we can give this color.

92
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.630
Carlos got.

93
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.130
Sign.

94
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.810
Okay.

95
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.180
Right.

96
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.120
I think we need that.

97
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.620
Okay.

98
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.250
This country needs to save.

99
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.630
And also we do not have any field known as company.

100
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.210
We can get rid of this and for now we can display the name of the customer.

101
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.180
Customer name.

102
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.880
Okay.

103
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.560
Customer name.

104
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.150
Okay.

105
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.250
And now when we click on this order, we want to go to that screen.

106
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.870
To do that, we have to go back to the profile, the profile screen.

107
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.140
Profile screen.

108
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.800
Okay.

109
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.120
And scroll down to where we have the other.

110
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.970
Okay.

111
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.320
Well, this is going to be navigator.

112
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:11.040
Navigator does push the routes is going to be something known as materia page route.

113
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.620
Okay.

114
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.600
It's going to take in the context.

115
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.200
And basically.

116
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.570
We want to return the customer or the screen.

117
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.590
Customer order.

118
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.080
Screen.

119
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.670
Look at this and way I think we need to alight and this can turn out in that same path and way.

120
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.760
We need this as well.

121
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.360
Okay.

122
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.980
Now.

123
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.430
Let's go check to see.

124
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.010
Okay.

125
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.950
Just have to get rid of this.

126
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.560
This country needs to save.

127
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.020
Okay.

128
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.790
Okay.

129
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.050
Click on the.

130
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.520
No material.

131
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.870
Sorry.

132
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.870
We also don't need to drop the list back to the customer screen and we have to wrap this with a material.

133
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.460
My theory.

134
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.480
Okay.

135
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.680
Okay.

136
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.310
So.

137
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.840
And you can try to save.

138
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.940
And this is going to work as expected.

139
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.480
Okay.

140
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.270
So school.

141
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.820
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
