00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.859
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.830
In this lecture, we're going to create the function in order to enable users been able to upload printouts.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.220
Okay.

5
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
Not to do this, they're going to need to go to the controller's directory.

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.610
And over here we're going to create a new fly and we're going to call this fly upload underscore product

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.470
on this call controller and just picture dot dot.

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.900
Okay.

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.460
Now, over here, you can see the first step we did was to create.

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.380
A class, right.

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.980
I told you is going to be same with this, right?

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.360
Okay.

13
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.880
So over here are going to create a class and they're going to call this class upload per that's controller.

14
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.950
Okay, great.

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.390
Now the next step, you can see over here what we did was to let's create a function in a that's sign

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.540
up users.

17
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.980
Okay.

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.070
So over here, they're going to create a function.

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.690
This is going to take some time.

20
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.280
And it's going to be a future.

21
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.129
Okay.

22
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.150
Now, all our data are all all of our fields are going to be straight, right?

23
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.130
I think the ones that are going to be number, we're definitely going to convert it to what is string.

24
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.610
Okay.

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.440
So now we can call this function upload product.

26
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.810
Probably you can just add ACARS.

27
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.270
Okay.

28
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.620
Okay.

29
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.080
Now you're going to be using the weights.

30
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.120
So definitely we're going to need the async.

31
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.660
Okay.

32
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.870
Now, the next thing to do is to pass in hall that two fields we need.

33
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.560
We are passing all those fields because we want to be able to pass the value to those fields.

34
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.110
Whenever we call this function card, upload product.

35
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.470
Okay.

36
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.640
Now, the first field we need is going to be the product name.

37
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.110
We can't just go with the title.

38
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.010
And this is going to be a string, right?

39
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.510
Because it's going to be a test.

40
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.930
Okay.

41
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.580
Now, the second field we need is what's the prize?

42
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.920
The product's category name.

43
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.260
Right.

44
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.610
Okay.

45
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.560
Rise as well.

46
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.480
We can't just drink and.

47
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.520
Products.

48
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:21.230
Her got her dad's car t gory name and as well we can we can use this country and B to make this right.

49
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.730
Okay.

50
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.580
Now, so we also need the idea of the products.

51
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.510
We can just do this before it doesn't really matter how available we can.

52
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.700
Yes.

53
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.890
Do this after this.

54
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.330
Okay.

55
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.460
String it.

56
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.300
Okay, comma.

57
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.710
Okay.

58
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.270
We also need to add the quantity of the products right to description.

59
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.600
We can just had descriptions first.

60
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.860
Okay.

61
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.540
So over here we can see string and this this creep and shun.

62
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.260
Okay.

63
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.430
Now we need.

64
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.690
What's the corn?

65
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.090
Corn?

66
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.170
T t.

67
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.720
Okay.

68
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.330
Okay.

69
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.380
String.

70
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.640
So in us stream what string.

71
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.180
Okay.

72
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.790
And lastly, we need what the image show l that is the product image of L and we can just go ahead and

73
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.220
specify that this is going to be a type of fly or you at least think you've seen this before.

74
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.990
Okay, now I light and use controlled dogs.

75
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.910
Now make sure you don't.

76
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.440
Okay.

77
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.500
I think make sure you don't import the dust that is HTML so you can get a very huge error and it's going

78
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.950
to crash.

79
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.620
You have to make sure your important front is not.

80
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.730
Okay.

81
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.110
Great.

82
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.180
Right.

83
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.610
Okay.

84
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.190
Okay.

85
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.470
Now, what we can do is we can check over.

86
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.360
You can see Garcia is going to be the same.

87
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.080
Okay.

88
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.390
Now the next step is to create a custom error.

89
00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.960
Right.

90
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.330
Okay.

91
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.850
So over here you can just see a string and causes variable rest.

92
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.790
That is going to be the short form for a result.

93
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.800
And we can just say something opponent.

94
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.170
You can't just add, but we don't know.

95
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.230
Okay, now the next step is what?

96
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:16.740
So use it.

97
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:24.270
Try and cache block in order to check if all this fields before this fields are valid or not or if the

98
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.720
users entered the field or not.

99
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.080
Okay.

100
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.350
So over there we can use it.

101
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.880
Try and catch.

102
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.930
Trying to catch.

103
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.440
You can just go.

104
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.670
It is, you know, that automatically generates the catch.

105
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.050
Okay.

106
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.870
And now we can use an effective meant.

107
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:50.360
We can just use country and be like, sorry not for you, but if we can see if tie two dots is not.

108
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.520
Empty.

109
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.930
Write tickets.

110
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.560
Empty.

111
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.790
Empty.

112
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.540
Write.

113
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.830
It is not empty.

114
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.970
And.

115
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.390
I'd say we're not going to be using this idea of idea because the idea is going to be the title of the

116
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.830
product.

117
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.140
Right.

118
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.380
Right.

119
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.950
You have that.

120
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.690
Okay.

121
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.550
So this is going to be hand.

122
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.550
And prize thought is not.

123
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.690
Empty.

124
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.620
And what's.

125
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.680
Dogs.

126
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.970
Cutie Gorey name is not.

127
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.010
Is not empty.

128
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.730
And what?

129
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.070
And.

130
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.310
Discussion.

131
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.980
Discussion.

132
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.780
That is not.

133
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.730
And see.

134
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.630
And what again?

135
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.870
Quantity.

136
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.250
And.

137
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.090
Juan.

138
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.610
Corn.

139
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.480
Corn.

140
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.580
Corn tea.

141
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.780
T.

142
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.150
Okay, the art is not empty.

143
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.600
Okay.

144
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.150
And lastly, an image.

145
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.830
Your hell is nuts.

146
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.490
Becau channel.

147
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:26.330
The reason for this is imagine if the user clicks on this gallery and it's supposed to tap into that

148
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.430
for users to the product, and then the user refuses to upload the products.

149
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.390
It's going to be no rights.

150
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.750
Okay.

151
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.620
Is not a court.

152
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.160
No.

153
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.610
Okay.

154
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.970
Okay.

155
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.350
Yeah.

156
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.510
What we can do is we can hide in, not check.

157
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.800
Okay.

158
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.630
Okay, great.

159
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.320
Okay.

160
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.670
Is control necessary in order to have a mattress?

161
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.830
And if all this feels and not a quarter?

162
00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:00.140
No, that is if the user actually filled in all the fields, then are going to store the values you

163
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.790
can see over here.

164
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.460
What we are simply doing is we created dynamic variables, right?

165
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.890
So any type would call this upload per.

166
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.530
That's a function we're gonna need to pass in the values to all this feels like.

167
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.750
Right.

168
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.120
Okay.

169
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.990
So if it is not empty, then we want to save.

170
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.870
It's to firebase so we can see it and you can use this way we have.

171
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.700
Firebase White's store.

172
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.670
We have dots in the corners, and that's a collection we want to save or we want to save the products

173
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.370
in the products collection.

174
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:44.210
And these products are going to be connected to this collection based on something known as ID rights

175
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.990
of product ID.

176
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.150
So you can set the dock and automatically go to the generic that, okay, we already have something

177
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.360
known as you, you I.D., right?

178
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.680
Okay.

179
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.070
So what we can do is we can initialize it over here.

180
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.320
We can see what we can see.

181
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.610
You, you ID?

182
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.790
He's going to be equal to what u u.

183
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.110
I d.

184
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.280
Okay.

185
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.010
So get rid of this, and I think you need this.

186
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.390
Okay.

187
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:22.130
So over a year, while we're over the strike, we can just say FINA and Cordis products.

188
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:23.930
It.

189
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.850
And it's a quiet sort.

190
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.090
He's going to be required to.

191
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.380
What the you.

192
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.970
It was agreeable then thought to be, for this is going to generate a unique number for us.

193
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.240
Okay.

194
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.960
So over here.

195
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.880
But in the past in the product.

196
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.380
I'd.

197
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.960
Okay, then we're just going to say dot set.

198
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.620
Okay.

199
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.830
You're this.

200
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.030
You've seen this before, right?

201
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.380
Okay.

202
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.620
And now you're going to pass in all this.

203
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.350
They feel this warped description.

204
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.460
Sorry.

205
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:00.940
Okay.

206
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.570
It is going to be tied to I think we call this.

207
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.190
Make sure this is going to be something like this.

208
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.840
They're going to get health care because in the wild fetching it.

209
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.760
This was the fields, right?

210
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.430
This was the asat spell end.

211
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.170
So make sure I think is the same thing we have over here.

212
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.540
Here is a sentiment.

213
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:24.960
Okay.

214
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.600
So this is going to be tighter and it's going to be more tied to.

215
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.300
So comma and there's going to be prize.

216
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.060
And is the price.

217
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.860
And just going to record that.

218
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.630
Products.

219
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:47.800
Okay.

Scripture.

238
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:30.760
Okay.

239
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.590
And our team is going to be quantity.

240
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.010
AK and AK.

241
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.350
One, I think.

242
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.460
How many fields we have.

243
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.520
One, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

244
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.080
And over here.

245
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.390
One, two, two, four, five.

246
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.540
I can remember that.

247
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.430
Okay.

248
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.630
We don't have to hide.

249
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.490
We can just do this, I tell you.

250
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.050
I.D. is going to be.

251
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.810
The tie to.

252
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.880
So we can just see it's going to be Heidi.

253
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.570
Okay.

254
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.000
One, two, two, four, five, six.

255
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:20.420
Okay.

256
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.290
Humanity.

257
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.740
What's in Maschera?

258
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:24.670
Image.

259
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.570
Okay.

260
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.500
This is going to be white image URL.

261
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.410
Okay.

262
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.520
Now we are yet to upload the image to the database.

263
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:38.940
Right.

264
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:39.260
Okay.

265
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.290
So all we can just do.

266
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.270
Okay.

267
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.650
So over here.

268
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.760
So we can just every time we turn race.

269
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.280
Okay.

270
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.870
You can see the error is gone now.

271
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.280
Okay.

272
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.520
Okay.

273
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.290
So all we can do is read.

274
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.750
You have the function in a nutshell, flawed.

275
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.390
Per that.

276
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.750
Right.

277
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.060
Okay.

278
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.950
So we can just copy this.

279
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.740
Copy and you find the reason you've forgotten about that.

280
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.080
You can just go ahead and watch it back.

281
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.500
Okay.

282
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.810
Imports.

283
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.270
Okay.

284
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.320
Is going to be high.

285
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.200
Rides a key fly and we need to import this.

286
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.070
Okay.

287
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.990
And dismally.

288
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.400
What's.

289
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.670
Image, Yara.

290
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.470
And instead of data, it's going to be pulled by.

291
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.490
And hard this.

292
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.210
Okay.

293
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.990
And image area.

294
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.350
Okay.

295
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.740
I think it's taking longer.

296
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.400
Okay.

297
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.150
Okay.

298
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:54.750
Great.

299
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.940
Now this is the image.

300
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:05.250
This is the function in order to upload what product to the storage that is over here.

301
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.580
And remember we are sort which we also to this product right.

302
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.380
And remember we are also retrieving.

303
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:12.810
Okay.

304
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.200
So it is going to be what products?

305
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.120
Okay.

306
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:19.810
Great.

307
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.000
And we are retrieving our product.

308
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.350
Right.

309
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.750
Okay.

310
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.210
So now all we can do is to.

311
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.020
Okay.

312
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.350
Is a copy this, right?

313
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.790
Okay.

314
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.810
Okay.

315
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.690
And now I know you must have forgotten all of this.

316
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.320
Okay?

317
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.720
You just have to try to go back to them, and it's going to be immeasurable.

318
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.390
Okay.

319
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.190
Right.

320
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.290
And he said, Oh, this, this is going to be the Lord.

321
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.650
Dear Lord Jarrell.

322
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:57.940
Okay.

323
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.640
This is basically it.

324
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.100
Knife.

325
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.390
You forgotten I did this.

326
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.230
You can please just go back to that lecture.

327
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.750
So yeah, we created the function that's upload image to the storage and we are sharing that image then

328
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.050
uploading it to what's first or database.

329
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.560
So this is basically it, right?

330
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.480
So you can look, you know, what you're going to need to do is try to see if you can call this function

331
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.080
yourself and see if you can pass in the value to it.

332
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.060
You're going to basically use the previous experience you have in doing this.

333
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.510
Okay?

334
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.510
Now when you're called in, you need to do best.

335
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.700
When you're learning, you need to master it as well.

336
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:46.070
So try to see if you can go back to this lecture and see how you did all this to see if you can.

337
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:53.670
Call this function we just have that is this so this class and then assess this function.
