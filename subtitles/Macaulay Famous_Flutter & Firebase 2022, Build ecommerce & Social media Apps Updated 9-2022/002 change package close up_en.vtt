00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.740
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.200
In this lecture, they're going to change the package name.

4
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.020
In all the slides it is being used.

5
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.480
Now, remember, in the process of integrating Firebase, we made our package unique.

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.560
That is, we have to change the default package name to our whole user name.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.830
But this is not the holy place.

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.080
The package name is been used.

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.750
So in this lecture they're going to change the package name and the rest of the files.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.200
Okay.

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.910
Now to do this one is control and B, to make this smaller than regular, go to Andriod.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.420
Then suss.

13
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay.

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.170
Now we're going to first go to debug then the Android manifest fly.

15
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.700
Now you can see it is still the example.

16
00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:00.970
So we are going to get rid of this example and use our unique package that is minus my colleague famous.

17
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.989
And now I'm going to lose control and that's to save.

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.950
Then we are going to go to the main then.

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.430
Sorry.

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.800
Men then got laid.

21
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.560
Then my first main man.

22
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.130
The first.

23
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.990
Okay.

24
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.200
May not, sweetie.

25
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.670
Right.

26
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.150
Okay.

27
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.510
Now, we're going to change this from example.

28
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.650
So are unique.

29
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.950
These are then my quality was.

30
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.280
Then we need to use control.

31
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.160
And that's the save.

32
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.390
Okay.

33
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.210
Then we're going to go to this address.

34
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.730
Okay.

35
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.530
Okay.

36
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.110
Just here.

37
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.090
Okay, great.

38
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.310
Now I is control and B to make this wide.

39
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.770
Then we need to change this.

40
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.920
To my colleague that is your username or whatever you pass there integrates in Firebase.

41
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.140
Okay, I'll try to save then.

42
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.710
They're going to need to changes in this profile as well.

43
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.820
Okay.

44
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.490
Now you're going to get rid of this example.

45
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.320
That is going to be our unique username.

46
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.510
My colleague here was.

47
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.060
Okay, great.

48
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.260
He is.

49
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.460
And save.

50
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.080
Okay.

51
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.760
Good.

52
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.220
Great.

53
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.310
Okay, guys, see you in in this lecture.
