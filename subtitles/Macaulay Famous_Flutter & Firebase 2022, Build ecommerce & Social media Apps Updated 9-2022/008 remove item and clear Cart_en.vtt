00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.980
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.790
In this lecture, we're going to be able to remove item from carts and as well clear all of our carts

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.070
item data.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.030
Okay, then they're not to do this.

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.080
We're going to need to go back to our VSA code and then the provider directory and then the cart, the

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.260
provider file.

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.450
Okay, now we can then use Control and D in order to make this way.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.840
Okay.

10
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.320
Okay.

11
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.940
Now we're going to create a function, or you can simply call it a mentor.

12
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.330
Okay.

13
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.670
So you're going to say void and I'm going to call this remove.

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.770
COTS.

15
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.340
I said, okay.

16
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.990
Now we're going to remove this item based on the product ID.

17
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.140
Right.

18
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.480
Okay.

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.590
Just put ideas.

20
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.030
Okay.

21
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.200
Now we can then call that on this.

22
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.470
Cards, items, dots.

23
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.920
I think we have their remote made.

24
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.610
So you can see takes key which is going to be the products.

25
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.610
Forget it.

26
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.900
Okay, great.

27
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.710
And that's all we can call the notify.

28
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.940
No.

29
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.520
To find the.

30
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.350
Okay, I.

31
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.480
And that's to save.

32
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.050
Okay.

33
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.510
Now we're going to go back to the cards.

34
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.740
It's a screen.

35
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.850
Okay.

36
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.940
Okay.

37
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.550
We're going to look for that control.

38
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.640
And B, I think this should be it.

39
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.590
You can just change it to black.

40
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.660
To see.

41
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.030
Okay.

42
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.610
It is.

43
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.660
Change it back to red.

44
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.760
Okay.

45
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.320
Now we're going to stay on the score cards provider.

46
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.380
Political card provider.

47
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.009
Then there's going to be darts.

48
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.890
Dodge guards remove.

49
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.460
Scott I think look, you can see it automatically past the product ID, okay, now are the semicolon

50
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.210
and then use control and that's to save and go check what you just did.

51
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.100
Okay, now I click on this.

52
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.720
Okay, great.

53
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.360
Now, when we click on this, we are going to be able to remove all our carts item data.

54
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.780
Okay.

55
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.200
Now to do this, I'm going to go back to the.

56
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.300
COTS provider.

57
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.560
Okay, now you going to create a new method or a new function?

58
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.060
Okay.

59
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.290
We're going to call this Claire.

60
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.650
Courts data.

61
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.940
Okay.

62
00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.990
No, I never leave the past in any product ID because we are not removing a specific product, but we

63
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.370
want to be able to click on this and then remove all the products we have.

64
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.730
Okay.

65
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.960
So I never go past anything and I will call the mystical card item that I think we have invented or

66
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.430
a function known as.

67
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.280
KLAY okay, great.

68
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.400
And as well, you can just call the notify.

69
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.170
The Snow Valley is going to look for changes you're making to the court's intent.

70
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.540
Okay.

71
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.860
And I think we have that.

72
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.710
We have the high bar in the court screen.

73
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.710
So you're going to go to the high bar.

74
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.800
But sorry, I think we have it in the courts.

75
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.450
Right.

76
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.850
Okay.

77
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.820
Cut screen and then use control and be digital via the actions button.

78
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.440
Okay, now we need to have access first.

79
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.500
To this class.

80
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.530
So this class called cost provider to have access to this method which in its okay.

81
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.320
Right.

82
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.920
And I think where you have access to that's already.

83
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.829
Okay.

84
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.690
Cut screen.

85
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.110
Controller.

86
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.960
B Okay.

87
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.050
I think radio of us is to provide a class.

88
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.880
Okay, so over here layer.

89
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.240
It's going to say underscore cards right there between those two qualities.

90
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.360
Dot clear data.

91
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.750
Okay.

92
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.330
Gotcha ness.

93
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.590
And.

94
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.530
And good check what you just did.

95
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.570
Okay.

96
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.470
Click on this.

97
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.310
Okay.

98
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.560
Now we can add.

99
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.700
And then.

100
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.540
Go back.

101
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.610
And why.

102
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.810
Okay, great.

103
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.000
Okay, guys, see you in that chair.
