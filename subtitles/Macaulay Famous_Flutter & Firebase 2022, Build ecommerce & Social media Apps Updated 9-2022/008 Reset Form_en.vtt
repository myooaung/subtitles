00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.880
Now, after successfully creating an account, what we can do is we can reset all these fields.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
To do this, we going to need to go back to our VTS code.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.920
And you can see over here we have this underscore faster and it ends here.

6
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.420
Right.

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.380
So right after saving the data to our cloud faster data database, what we can then do, we can call

8
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.850
the underscore from key.

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.450
Form key.

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.620
And we have to get the current situation of the form by saying current state and do.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.330
We set.

12
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.950
Okay.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
And over here we.

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.240
We need a no check.

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.810
Okay.

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.130
And in essence, to do what this we basically do is to reset all those fields we have.

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.330
That is the 1 to 3 fields.

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.360
And also, we are going to be able to reset the image field to make it right.

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.690
To do that, we have to set state.

20
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.310
And that's how update the UI because we basically want to update this to nothing.

21
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.810
Right.

22
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.410
Okay.

23
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.680
So I can then use this set state.

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.140
Set state.

25
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.650
And we are going to call the underscore image and we're going to set it to law.

26
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.680
Okay.

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.610
Great.

28
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.460
This is basically it's a news conference to save.

29
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.390
And.

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.480
Click on this.

31
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.770
Again.

32
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.690
Hopefully it has been clicked.

33
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.280
And it's going to take some time.

34
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.590
It's a reset.

35
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.880
Everything for us.

36
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.200
He is going to check what is going on on my debug console.

37
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.570
Okay.

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.380
I think network issues.

39
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.720
And we just have to wait for this.

40
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.200
It beats.

41
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.570
Okay.

42
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.020
To click on it again.

43
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.010
Okay.

44
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.430
Okay.

45
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.190
Okay.

46
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.340
Naureen asfar based looker.

47
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.230
This is basically network issues.

48
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.940
I can just reset, restart my visa code.

49
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.650
We start.

50
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.370
So, you know, we start in my vehicle.

51
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.650
I don't know what I'm saying.

52
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.690
We start my up.

53
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.930
And.

54
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.860
Okay.

55
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.250
Now let's go check this out.

56
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.260
It's kind of hard to start this.

57
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.270
But we start this.

58
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.880
Please.

59
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.340
Okay.

60
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.450
And we can sign up.

61
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.670
Upload a profile photo.

62
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.000
And.

63
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.660
I'm just going to say a few words.

64
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.520
If my store.

65
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.860
And Email knows full name is monster and the image is going to be from monster as well.

66
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.470
HTML.

67
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.470
That's calm.

68
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.010
And the password is going to be a MSI and sign up.

69
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.100
It's going to reset this field now.

70
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.370
Okay.

71
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.730
Within.

72
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.040
Within, within, within.

73
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.850
Okay.

74
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.740
Seems good.

75
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.300
Okay, guys.

76
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.770
See you.

77
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.050
And then.
