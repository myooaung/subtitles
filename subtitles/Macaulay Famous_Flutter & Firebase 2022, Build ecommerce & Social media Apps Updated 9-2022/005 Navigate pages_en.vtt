00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.750
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.480
Oracle, the last lecture we made all this navigation it the cable.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.130
Now this lecture, we're going to be able to navigate with ten pages.

4
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.540
Okay.

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.660
Not to do this.

6
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.660
So I'm going to go back to our visa code.

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.450
First of all, I'm gonna use Control and B to make this wider.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.550
Okay, now you can see we have this navigation bar item that is the, um, the field, the search,

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.400
the cart upload person.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.820
So it does prefer.

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.140
Right.

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.380
Okay.

13
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160
So we're going to create all this pages, okay?

14
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.340
Not to do this again.

15
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.770
We're going to go to our screens for the first of all, I'm just going to use control on the to make

16
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.520
this smaller.

17
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.930
Then we're going to go to our screens for the.

18
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.700
Okay.

19
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.420
Now we're going to create a new FY.

20
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.960
This is going to be home on the screen.

21
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.230
Then the Dodds.

22
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.070
Okay.

23
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.420
Now we can use this as we just for now at least.

24
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.900
We can also change it later.

25
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.470
Okay.

26
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.540
If we want.

27
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.380
Okay.

28
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.920
So this is going to be.

29
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.090
See how.

30
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.500
Okay.

31
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.400
So at least we did.

32
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.790
Okay.

33
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.400
We can call this on screen.

34
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.610
Okay, then over here, like for us, there is control and dots and that's important and lets you add

35
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.730
to that package of returning records in a.

36
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.980
It's on the scaffold.

37
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.320
So we have access to book of properties.

38
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.710
Okay, now I'm going to give you a body for now.

39
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.090
Then you're going to have a center, which it's the centered in this table up in the head.

40
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.940
Then you're going to have each side there.

41
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.900
We can have a test that says of screen.

42
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.600
Okay.

43
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.060
Great.

44
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.020
Okay.

45
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.080
Now what's cabinet doing this again is you're going to tap on this again.

46
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.180
They're going to create a new fly.

47
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.140
Right.

48
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.570
So this should be words.

49
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.310
Just going to check it out here.

50
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.070
The fields.

51
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.830
Okay.

52
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.880
It's on the screen.

53
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.979
Though.

54
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.270
That's okay.

55
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.100
So we're going to do it again.

56
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.450
So it's going to be filled, full screen.

57
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.840
Right.

58
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.500
Really, you don't need to follow the plot to follow.

59
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.610
You can also just name your something.

60
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.900
This.

61
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.090
Okay.

62
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.440
So now to have access to local poverty I'm going to have is covered.

63
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.600
Okay.

64
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.430
So we're going to have a body.

65
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.570
There's going to be what is sent to Saint-Denis.

66
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.980
We just had a case.

67
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.080
So this is going to be charged.

68
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.460
Then we're going to see test.

69
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.130
So there's going to be fears.

70
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.610
Feels screen rights.

71
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.080
Okay.

72
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.600
Now, I believe you are master of this process, right?

73
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.860
So now what I can just do is to copy this over to a ten year contract, a quarter, and see to coffee,

74
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.710
or try to beat the biggest smile that we can.

75
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.490
Just go and create a new fire.

76
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.530
I think that's why we need is a search for this screen the dots.

77
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.550
Okay.

78
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.230
Then we can take this.

79
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.220
This is off screen.

80
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.850
It's going to be.

81
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.160
There's going to be search.

82
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.280
Screen.

83
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.770
So instead of this is going to be.

84
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.770
Okay.

85
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.490
I think the other by.

86
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.550
We need the cards to upload and profile.

87
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.410
So cards uploaded so far, so over the screens.

88
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.330
Okay.

89
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.930
If I want to create cards or this screen.

90
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.150
The that.

91
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.960
Okay.

92
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.570
Okay.

93
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.260
Now I'm just going to face this is going to be what's cut.

94
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.310
Screen there's going to be.

95
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.910
Cuts.

96
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.850
Right.

97
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.310
Okay.

98
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.120
We need.

99
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.080
What's the.

100
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.080
Upload and profile now.

101
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.690
Okay.

102
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.230
So.

103
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.980
Whether you are going to create a new screen again.

104
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.910
So it is going to be.

105
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.630
Upload this screen.

106
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.250
But that's okay.

107
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.890
Is this okay?

108
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.030
We need this to upload and all a.

109
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.110
Offload.

110
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.160
Okay.

111
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.190
The last on the list is the profile.

112
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.960
Okay.

113
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.690
So.

114
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.570
We're going to create the screens in the screens.

115
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.190
We're going to create the firefly on the screen, the dots.

116
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.760
Okay, we can see this.

117
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.040
Okay.

118
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.490
This is going to be the Spotify screen, right.

119
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.910
Okay.

120
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.260
So this is going to be.

121
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.380
For ice cream.

122
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.070
Okay, great.

123
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.470
So there's the six pages we need, right?

124
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.920
Okay.

125
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.840
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to create a variable to hold all those images.

126
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.420
So all those pages we just created.

127
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.680
Okay, now to do this, I just got to go to the cost to that.

128
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.160
Why?

129
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.730
Okay.

130
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.960
What you can do is you can just do this above.

131
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.080
Okay.

132
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.880
So what you can do for us, we can give you comments or we can say pages.

133
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.630
Okay.

134
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.140
So now we can create a travel card pages.

135
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.760
We can just give you the type of list.

136
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.790
So that is a list of pages, right?

137
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.210
Okay.

138
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.150
So this is going to be quite a list.

139
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.660
Okay.

140
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.550
Now we're going to pass the first page.

141
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.940
That is the home screen, right.

142
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.450
Okay.

143
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.060
Then the second one.

144
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.310
We need to do what we need to fields.

145
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.350
His Korean.

146
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.300
So.

147
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.830
His screen rights AK.

148
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.380
Okay.

149
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.610
Alight control does the imported.

150
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.720
Okay.

151
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.520
The other we need is the search card.

152
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.160
Okay.

153
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.050
Search screen.

154
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.010
Cut screen.

155
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.590
Right.

156
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.850
The 1 to 2 for which we need to.

157
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.670
Offload screen.

158
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.720
And lastly, we need to provide.

159
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.760
Screen.

160
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.480
Okay.

161
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.760
Great idea, civic.

162
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.960
A lot of great.

163
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.280
Now to just.

164
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.270
Gets across this page.

165
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.290
What's I just going to do is we're going to go to.

166
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.430
The boat's navigation.

167
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.800
The.

168
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.480
Okay.

169
00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.360
They're looking at a body, so we tend to scaffold the body.

170
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.300
The word is going to be dark pages we just created.

171
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.790
Then you're going to send the page in this.

172
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.610
Okay.

173
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.810
Paging this.

174
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.260
Great.

175
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.290
So is basically.

176
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.670
It is is that.

177
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.330
Okay.

178
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.870
So I wanted to be in a coma.

179
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.300
Okay, so easy as that.

180
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.910
First of all, we created a river called Sage.

181
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.540
And as I said, it's a zero.

182
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.410
We should be just at the point that is the whole page.

183
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.230
Then over here we are saying once.

184
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.220
The fourth largest was for this location by Taylor Creek.

185
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.980
What sort of dates it once did?

186
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.640
The Indians.

187
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.540
That is from 0 to 1, from 1 to 2.

188
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.330
And over here, this is terrible.

189
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.080
So we have more leg of dates in this variable to something else.

190
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.100
So this is going to once again is going to be one.

191
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.490
What is this?

192
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.940
It is to convert data to click again, Siri for and so on and over you I guess I said the.

193
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.220
Prejudiced.

194
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.660
Okay, we don't understand.

195
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.900
This is fine.

196
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.300
I believe you can understand it.

197
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.460
As the time goes, I probably will give you some more explanation to this.

198
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.670
Again, as we go woefully, you get it?

199
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.520
Okay.

200
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.880
Well, not your as I said when I was in studies, you know, it's automatically saved those on saved

201
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.450
files.

202
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.309
Okay.

203
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.159
So you can see it's very easy.

204
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.610
Serious.

205
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.370
I just want you to understand everything.

206
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.110
Okay, great.

207
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.179
Now click on this.

208
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.230
Okay, great.

209
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.510
So you can see it's working.

210
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.290
Okay.

211
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.080
Good.

212
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.530
Okay.

213
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.610
Okay, guys.

214
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.840
See you in the next.
