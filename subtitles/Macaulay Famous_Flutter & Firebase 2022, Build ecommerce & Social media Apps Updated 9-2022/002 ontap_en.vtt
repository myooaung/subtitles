00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.859
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.800
In this lecture, we're going to make all this clickable.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.350
Okay, then I got to do this over here.

5
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.360
We're going to create a variable.

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm going to call this variable page index, and you're going to set it to zero, which is going to

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.950
be the first item we have.

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.270
That is the meet and chat.

9
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.750
Okay.

10
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.560
You can see it wants us to specify the type of variable.

11
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.550
This is a number.

12
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.710
So definitely it has no decimal and this is going to be ints.

13
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.550
Right?

14
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.630
Okay, great.

15
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.080
Now the next you're going to need to do is to update the UI and in order to update the UI, we're going

16
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.460
to need to use the set state.

17
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.510
And this state is not available in this state, less widgets.

18
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.840
So what we need to do is to provide this state for widget.

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.900
And in order to do that, all you have to do is to light and then you scroll trends that converts to

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.760
state for widgets.

21
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.160
Okay.

22
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.570
Now the bottom navigation bar also has a property known as on tap.

23
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.290
This is a function.

24
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.860
Okay, now over here, we're going to pass the E!

25
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.590
Dance, which is also referring to the stats and points.

26
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.240
That's the zero.

27
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.350
Okay.

28
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.000
And now we can use this says State.

29
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.250
You know, that sort of dates the UI said state.

30
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.740
You can see now is available.

31
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.190
Okay.

32
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.210
Then what we can do is we can call this river card page a dance.

33
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.910
Then I'm going to say equal to the IDs.

34
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.880
Okay.

35
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.080
Great.

36
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.690
Okay.

37
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.010
Now, over here.

38
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.710
What we just have to do next is.

39
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.040
Called the currency DES, which is also a property of this den, I'm going to say is equal to the page

40
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.650
indents.

41
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.020
Okay, that's a zero.

42
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.300
So what this is going to do is.

43
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.670
Okay, now let's just try this out first.

44
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.320
Click on this.

45
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.280
You can see it is now clickable for the now over our year.

46
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.790
We said it's going to be zero.

47
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.810
Right.

48
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.330
Which means it's going to be your first.

49
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.280
I caught this first item right that over here we are using a function called ONTAP, which is a property

50
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.530
found in this bottle navigation bar.

51
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.669
Right.

52
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.740
And over here we are passing the Indians.

53
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.620
And the way we are using this state, which is whenever I would click on any of this, we then want

54
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.960
to date this zero.

55
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.040
Okay.

56
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.710
Now you can see where we are seeing the current index.

57
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.890
That's all the current page is going to be zero.

58
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.710
So for now, for now, without clicking on any of this is going to be zero.

59
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.550
Right.

60
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.840
Let's just hit zero.

61
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.910
In this country an excessive.

62
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.610
It's going to be at this first.

63
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.350
Now, you see now when you click on this is going to update to what's what.

64
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.750
Okay use country in this.

65
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.900
He's going to be at this now.

66
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.470
Mickey Casey, when you click on any of this, again, you can see this on tap and this is the post

67
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.250
navigation bar.

68
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.040
So it's it has notice of all this.

69
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.850
So as well is going to have data to see and so on.

70
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.490
So what we are just doing is passing the page.

71
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.320
Page indents, so it will automatically update itself, right?

72
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.180
So whenever you click on this is going to update this page as to zero one, two and so on.

73
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.450
And for the starting point it is at zero, right?

74
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.510
So we want this first, okay?

75
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.460
This trend is to save and that is basically it fully understand why if he does is absolutely fine and

76
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.120
you can do what?

77
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.810
So let me know.

78
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.270
So I will try my best to play better.

79
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.050
So you okay guys see you in the nest.

80
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.210
That.
