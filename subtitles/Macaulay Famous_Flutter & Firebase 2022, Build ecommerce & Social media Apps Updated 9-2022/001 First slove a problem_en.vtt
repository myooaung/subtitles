Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.560
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.200
Now, in in this lecture, I'm going to make a mistake.

4
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.970
Ah, the mistake is this password dot is enter.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.740
This should be password does is not enter it.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.890
I'm for telling you this so you correct us and when you say the time is I would say okay.

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.950
Ah, the reason is because first of all we are checking in the fields is empty or not.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.870
That is if the field of values or if the fields is field, then only you want to sign in the user with

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.850
the email and password.

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.450
So this should be is not empty.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.060
Are not is empty.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.980
So not this, but this.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.330
So you can observe changes and maybe you see Amitabh is empty, right?

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.340
So are going to do this in the next lecture.

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.080
And I'm telling you this.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.010
So you don't encounter such error.

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.500
Right.

18
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.870
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
