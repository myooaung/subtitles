00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.839
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:08.580
In this lecture, we are going to retrieve products from our cloud faster database.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.340
And I'm going to show you on how to do this.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.580
Using the flow fire documentation.

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.540
You can see basically we have two main ways of retrieving data from the cloud faster database, and

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.990
one of the ways is using a future builder.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.580
And I think I've shown you this before, I'm going to show you this again.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.950
Leap and.

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.940
Views, views and profile.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.360
Okay.

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.870
Profile screen and you can see why we are using the future of beta.

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.040
And there is no difference between this code and what we have over here because I basically got it from

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.750
here.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.420
Right.

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.560
Okay.

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.420
So what I'm trying to say, we have two main ways of retrieving data from our cloud faster.

18
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.080
And one of the ways is using a future beta.

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.230
And you can basically see what it does over here is it's read a collection of documents once.

20
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.250
Right.

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.300
That means.

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:26.580
Once we use a future builder, if a new data comes in, we have to refresh that screen in order to get

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.820
that new data.

24
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.670
So that's what is basically saying.

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.850
So read a collection or document once, call the query dots, gas or documentary trends that get stored

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.380
in the below.

27
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.180
You can see why and this was the code basically just copied from okay.

28
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.150
And another way of retrieving data is using a distributor.

29
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.410
You can basically see what it does every time changes flutter fire provides support for dealing with

30
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.910
real time changes.

31
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.680
What this is basically saying is like your WhatsApp, when a user sends you message, you get this in

32
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.520
real time.

33
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.180
So when you want to retrieve data and you basically want the data to appear immediately without having

34
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.650
to refresh that screen, what you have to use is something known as Stream Viewer, which you can still

35
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.510
buy, and it is very similar to that of The Future Builder, just that when you use the future builder,

36
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.110
if a new data comes in, you have to refresh that screen in order to get that new data.

37
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.600
But if you use a distributor, it will immediately get that new data without having you to refresh.

38
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.830
Okay.

39
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.600
Just like WhatsApp chats.

40
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.080
Okay.

41
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.280
We can basically say WhatsApp chat is using a stream builder.

42
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.980
Right.

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.570
Okay.

44
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.030
Now, what we can do now is.

45
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.960
I'm just going to close this.

46
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.860
And within the views, we are going to create a new folder and we're going to call this folder gallery.

47
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.280
And within the gallery, we are going to create a new file and we can call this main.

48
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.330
Gallery.

49
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.240
Dot gaming gallery, maybe screen then dot dot.

50
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.280
Okay.

51
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.560
And this control should be and we're going to create a stateful widgets stateful widget and we can call

52
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.370
this man.

53
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.390
Gallery and screen.

54
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.570
And over here we have to alight and use control and dots to import the material.

55
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.940
That's package.

56
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.690
And for now we can just say maybe color colors.

57
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.940
Okay.

58
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.740
Call us that red.

59
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.770
Okay.

60
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.310
And use control necessary.

61
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.300
And what we can do, we can head back to the home screen.

62
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.800
Homescreen.

63
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.140
And instead of having this over here, we can get rid of it.

64
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.800
That is with the tab bar view.

65
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.410
Right.

66
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.240
And we can then use the.

67
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.510
The men I think we call this inwards Galloway screen and definitely you have to halt to start this.

68
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:30.530
It's going to take some time to restart and basically we have to log in again and.

69
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.730
We are then going to see this new screen called Main Gallery Screen.

70
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.150
Let's just wait for this a bit and.

71
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.480
Okay.

72
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.920
Okay.

73
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.850
Okay.

74
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.760
And now we have to log in because this is going to take us back to the.

75
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.620
Okay.

76
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.990
And the email address is.

77
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.300
Click on this link.

78
00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.920
Sorry.

79
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.980
Famous store.

80
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.950
Just going to log into G.M..

81
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.230
It's calm.

82
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.120
The Aegean Sea and in.

83
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.560
Okay.

84
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.860
Okay is walking right in back to the gallery folder and main gallery.

85
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.970
And what we want to do is to retrieve the products we have over here.

86
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.610
Right.

87
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.420
To do that, we are going to be using the computer because any time we upload a product over here,

88
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.160
we want it to be displayed real time in the main gallery screen.

89
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.860
Okay.

90
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.840
Great.

91
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.440
And to do that to.

92
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.310
Do that.

93
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.930
All we just have to do is to copy from this over here.

94
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.150
And it's, it's yeah, right.

95
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.950
It's concurrency and copy.

96
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.860
And we then have to get rid of this container.

97
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.970
And his this.

98
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.490
And definitely we're going to have all these errors.

99
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.950
First of all, we have to import this.

100
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.530
Okay.

101
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.720
And now it can't find this.

102
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.680
So what we then have to do is to copy this code.

103
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.300
Copy this code.

104
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.070
And.

105
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.990
We ended the past year OC before the override.

106
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.920
And we are going to this over a year.

107
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.360
We can just just control and be.

108
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.490
And instead of user stream, we are not recurring users but products.

109
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.790
So we are going to call this on this core product.

110
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.600
Third upstream.

111
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.400
And definitely we have to change this to underscore products.

112
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.770
Products was stream.

113
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.280
Okay.

114
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.030
Sounds good.

115
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.150
And this is going to be what products?

116
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.490
That is the name of this collection.

117
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.370
Or via products.

118
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.610
Right.

119
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.510
In the future.

120
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.670
Don't worry, we will be able to filter just for the main.

121
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.090
But for now we can just retrieve all of our products.

122
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:17.940
Okay.

123
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.970
This is basically all we need to do.

124
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:28.750
You can see why over here we basically created a variable called on the score product stream and it's

125
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.350
equal to Firebase Faster.

126
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.980
I think you've seen something similar to this before.

127
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:40.120
Those dot collection and the name of the collection is Product Right and Dot Snapshot.

128
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.950
This is basically referring to Dot get right.

129
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.100
Same with the future beta.

130
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:52.140
I think for the future beta, we said don't get what first stream beta you have to say dot snapshot.

131
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:59.410
So it's basically it's basically a similar to that of the dot get and it is also a type of query snapshots

132
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.600
when dealing with a lot of data as it is referred to as query snapshots.

133
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.080
And you can see why I think you see something like this before.

134
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.100
It's snapshots.

135
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.210
Snapshots.

136
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.800
And this is a variable that has access to all our details over here.

137
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:16.610
Right.

138
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:22.820
And we're are basically saying if it has error, we don't want to return a test which is going to say

139
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.170
something went wrong.

140
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:31.430
If our condition states that is equal to weighting, that is if it is trying to fetch the data, we

141
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:38.600
then want to return a test or we don't want to return it, but we want to return its center widget.

142
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.660
And this is going to have a chart and secular secular progress.

143
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.340
Progress.

144
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.400
Progress.

145
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.780
Okay.

146
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.280
Hopefully.

147
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.800
Secular.

148
00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.120
Progress.

149
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.270
Indicator.

150
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.870
And we're going to change the colors to say colors assign.

151
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.430
Okay.

152
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:11.230
So when trying to retrieve data, I think we need an addition.

153
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.810
We want to have that little spinner.

154
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.490
Okay.

155
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.020
In the way you can.

156
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.410
I think you basically know what this is.

157
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.700
And we do not have any fields known as full name.

158
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.610
But we do have what?

159
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.430
Here we have a product.

160
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.360
I think we have product name.

161
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:34.870
Okay.

162
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.220
We have product name.

163
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.140
Okay.

164
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.240
Look for the test.

165
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:47.130
This is just going to be product name and maybe price.

166
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.400
Okay.

167
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.640
We're just going to display these two fields for now.

168
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.240
Okay.

169
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.400
Price and product name.

170
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.990
Hopefully we have no spelling mistakes or else we are going to have a state error.

171
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.300
This country needs to save.

172
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.910
And let's go see if.

173
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.670
Okay.

174
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.660
And the reason for this error is because this prize is a number.

175
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.380
Right.

176
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:18.050
And you can see over here we are basically converting to test.

177
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.400
So what we have to do.

178
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.250
So we are just saying it is a test.

179
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.960
And you can see over here we are expecting a number.

180
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.470
You can see the type is a number and we are passing that number to a test.

181
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:36.980
So what we have to do is to convert this number to string by saying dot to string.

182
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.400
Okay.

183
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.440
Is control and save now?

184
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.450
And.

185
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.070
Okay.

186
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.240
Maybe I'm just going to.

187
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.060
Okay.

188
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.960
What we can just do is restart or restart this.

189
00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.670
And it will take some time.

190
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.040
Okay.

191
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.400
Let's go check it out.

192
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.870
We have to re log in again.

193
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.540
We are going to sort this out in the future.

194
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.210
Famous stir.

195
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:24.710
It's a G.M. that's come and be g-a-y YMC and again.

196
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.990
Okay.

197
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.220
Still the same.

198
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.110
Okay.

199
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:38.030
What we can just do for now, we can just maybe get rid of the subsides for now and use control necessary

200
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.990
save to display just the product name.

201
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.860
Okay.

202
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.230
Okay.

203
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.020
You can see.

204
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.310
Wow.

205
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.990
Successfully fetched.

206
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:57.020
So we have successfully retrieved the the products from our cloud faster rights since good.
