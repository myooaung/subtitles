00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.850
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.250
Walker In this lecture, they're going to have some productive falls category.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.240
And also we are going to be able to say that from this op.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.700
Okay.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.760
And in that to do this, you're going to need to go back to obviously code and then the provider directory

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.280
and then the products that that fly.

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.360
Okay.

8
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.410
Now what we are simply doing.

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.780
Is over here.

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.230
We are using the products model which we have in the models directory and then.

11
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.080
Over here.

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.630
You can see we created a class called Products and we're passing all this fields.

13
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.650
That is the idea of the products, the types of the products, the description that we put out, the

14
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.590
price, the imagery of the products, category name and as well the quantity of the products.

15
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.100
Okay.

16
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.280
Now, all this can be seen as what's variables.

17
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.330
Right.

18
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.640
Then over here in the provider.

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.620
So that's why we are simply assigning values to that variable.

20
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.860
And over it, we created a variable to store those values.

21
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.250
Okay.

22
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:17.110
Now, what we can simply do is we can copy this products, this controller and see.

23
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.460
And then pace.

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.390
Okay.

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.160
You know, if I.

26
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.130
The height is going to be.

27
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.150
Can I just say the Heidi?

28
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.080
Should be iPhone.

29
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.630
Definitely the products are going to be coming from the fire base and not from the air.

30
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.960
Right.

31
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.270
Okay.

32
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.710
For the title of the products, it's going to be high form.

33
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670
Then where we can just say iPhone.

34
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.440
iPhone is one of the best selling.

35
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.810
Phones.

36
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.940
Okay.

37
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.060
We can say the price is just ten.

38
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.110
The tiny dollar.

39
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.510
Okay.

40
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.240
For the imagery.

41
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.340
I don't think I have any products.

42
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.200
Has to do it for that.

43
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.530
We can just use the image for the category.

44
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.950
Okay.

45
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.160
Now we can go to the assets directory.

46
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.289
Images.

47
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.500
And over here, we can just copy the parts to make sure we don't have to spin the Mystic Falls.

48
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.060
We can.

49
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.490
Try to.

50
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.390
Okay, then.

51
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.930
Copy.

52
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.040
Okay.

53
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.640
Now I'm going to collapse this.

54
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.980
And then the lead provider and this.

55
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.490
Okay.

56
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.790
Then I said, Oh, this is going to be the.

57
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.410
Okay.

58
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.800
Now as well, the category is going to be four holes.

59
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.260
So we're going to change this to.

60
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.510
Think you said, homes.

61
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.870
Okay.

62
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.910
Now how to start this?

63
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.260
Okay.

64
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.140
I think.

65
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.530
Okay.

66
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.800
Great.

67
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.290
We can say we have 4 to 5 phones available, up to five iPhone phones.

68
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.730
Okay.

69
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.190
I'm sure, and not click on this.

70
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.710
You can see just falls are being displayed.

71
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.390
The country's just closed with a spate.

72
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.760
And as well, like on this laptop, we don't have any products on Daddy's laptop.

73
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.250
Right.

74
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.570
Okay.

75
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.510
Now, you're going to be able to click on that.

76
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.650
Want to be able to say that now?

77
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.000
Okay.

78
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.350
Not to do this.

79
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.370
We already have a cost to that fight.

80
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.560
And over a year we are.

81
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.500
Well where we have a rebel available called Firebase Hearts.

82
00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:00.170
And we are saying Firebase dogs, Firebase Hotspots instance, if I miss or it has to do with user authentication.

83
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.440
Right.

84
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.770
Okay.

85
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.400
So what you are going to need to do is you're going to go back to ready to go to the.

86
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.360
Screens, I think screens.

87
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.730
Right.

88
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.080
Okay.

89
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.160
We have the sci fi card profile screen.

90
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.029
Okay.

91
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.770
Now instead of this test widgets, we can just get rid of this and use an elevated.

92
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.790
Elevated button for now.

93
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.050
Elevated.

94
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.240
But in.

95
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.780
As in it is going to take the press.

96
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.900
Okay.

97
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.260
The child is going to be a test jets.

98
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.030
And he's just going to say sign.

99
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.170
Out.

100
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.040
Okay.

101
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.590
For now, we can just give some.

102
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.910
Okay.

103
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.580
So started this.

104
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.760
And it's going to be test.

105
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.510
So.

106
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.290
You can just see a font size of.

107
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.030
Sweet tea and fun sweets.

108
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.530
From Tweets.

109
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.960
The board.

110
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.240
Okay.

111
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.140
I think we're missing one one as well.

112
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.530
Okay.

113
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.700
There trachoma and then use control and excessive.

114
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.500
Okay.

115
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.950
Go back to the profile.

116
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.090
Okay.

117
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.490
You can see the way that what we're going to do is we're going to call that rainbow we have in our cost

118
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.270
file.

119
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.350
Okay, so we're.

120
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.310
They're going to pass on the async because it's going to take some time.

121
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.930
So we will need to wait it.

122
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.630
Okay.

123
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.420
So we'll just have to do is the caller will be called Firebase.

124
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.520
Hobbies.

125
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.990
Arts.

126
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.970
Dots.

127
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.670
Sign.

128
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.070
Ouch.

129
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.040
Okay.

130
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.280
That is going to take some time.

131
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.380
So we're going to need to wait this out for it.

132
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.390
Good.

133
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.100
Now she starts this.

134
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.810
Okay.

135
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.890
Now, most of the time you ought to watch this.

136
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.190
That shows 1 to 5 times in order for you to master the code and be able to code.

137
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.850
On your phone.

138
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.440
Okay.

139
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.170
Now we're going to go back to the.

140
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.400
I think you're going to go back to the profile and click on this.

141
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.800
It connects.

142
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.340
Okay, great.
