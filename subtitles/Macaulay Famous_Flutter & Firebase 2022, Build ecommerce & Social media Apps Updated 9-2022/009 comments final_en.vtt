00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.120
Our guys work hard in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.550
We're going to display the rest of the fields.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.300
Okay?

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.900
But before then, we're going to need to head up to a browser and then head up to pop the dab.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.330
And then over here, we're going to need to search for a package known as time ago.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.850
We are basically going to use this to display the date the comment was posted.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.420
Okay.

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.750
So we're going to need to click on this first link over here.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.110
And then the next step is to copy this code and then head up to your VSL code and then your post back

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.760
guts yaml file.

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.370
And you're going to need to have this override yet you can see I basically have mine over here so you

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.040
can use controlling the SE to save and then probably you need to restart your voice code.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.520
Okay.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.170
Now you're going to need to go back to the package and the following step is to copy this.

15
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.020
Copy this.

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.220
Okay, copy this.

17
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.470
Imparts concurrency.

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.490
And then we're going to need to head up to the comment screen.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.850
The comments created over a year concur and B to make this wide and.

20
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.450
We're going to need to pace this over a year.

21
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.650
You can see basically we are important.

22
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.860
Sorry, I think I missed it.

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.340
Okay.

24
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.800
AP.

25
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.390
Okay.

26
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.600
Okay.

27
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.290
Now, basically, we are important the package and we are renaming next time they go.

28
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.750
You can see this as a variable which.

29
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.410
Have access to this.

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.340
Okay, then, now that you do this, we need to go to where we have that date and we can get rid of

31
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.730
this.

32
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.110
And then, of course, time ago.

33
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.690
And now we can say, don't follow us.

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.240
You're going to see what this does shortly.

35
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.150
And we can then call the comments, dots, dates published.

36
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.410
And now we're going to need to convert this to a date so you can't say dots.

37
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.470
So you can see we can't actually key into it.

38
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.230
We can just go ahead and say dots to date.

39
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.680
Today.

40
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.130
It's the time of the spelling mistake, and we can call this.

41
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.270
Okay.

42
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.490
Now, how to start this?

43
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.260
Okay.

44
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.230
Let's start in.

45
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.830
Okay.

46
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.520
Now, order two.

47
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.550
You're going to need to make sure of it.

48
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.240
You can see we have this date published.

49
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.770
Right.

50
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.170
Okay.

51
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.170
Now you're going to need to make sure in the.

52
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.510
What?

53
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.860
Is there?

54
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.260
A tree?

55
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.540
In the models that we.

56
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.020
You going to need to make sure you don't have any spelling mistake because Ashley made a mistake instead

57
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.500
of this.

58
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.140
I was having a copy to be.

59
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.200
And you can see what we what we have in the database is this is this field over here.

60
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.340
So make sure you don't have any spelling mistakes as you can get it here.

61
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.910
Okay.

62
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.920
So now I can click on this.

63
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.190
Okay.

64
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.240
I can see 2 hours ago, you can see what's basically doors and we can have that in the comments to see.

65
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.880
Nice.

66
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.390
Okay.

67
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.400
You're going to see a moment ago now.

68
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.650
A moment ago.

69
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.440
You can see.

70
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.980
We can.

71
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.190
Had another.

72
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.160
Okay.

73
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.110
Now, the other team we're going to need to do is email.

74
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.720
They will post a comment.

75
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.120
We want to automatically declare this field.

76
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.600
Okay.

77
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770
Not to do this, we're going to need to go back to the comments screen.

78
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.130
Comment screen and we can use controller and bits and make this wide.

79
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.390
Okay.

80
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.750
Now we have this telex over here instead of telex.

81
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.940
We can use a concatenation in the call in the Dutch to join both a string and the verb put together.

82
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.930
So we can have this have a dollar sign and now we can then see comments.

83
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.340
That's what likes and wants to get as many comments we have.

84
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.570
So once we want to get as many likes, we have to get as many likes we have we can then core delight.

85
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.580
Okay, now is control.

86
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.800
And as to save.

87
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.860
But you can see we have zero likes.

88
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:19.899
Right.

89
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.290
Okay.

90
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.940
Now, you're going to need to clear this field.

91
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.590
Whenever we post a comment.

92
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.030
Not still this.

93
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.830
Over here, you can see we basically using an arrow function and so have to do this over here.

94
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.080
We cannot use an arrow function.

95
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.900
So all we can do is we can copy this.

96
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.360
And they said this error, we can break this down and have this and we can then had a semicolon to say,

97
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.510
this is the head of the code for this and we can then have another which is going to be on this core

98
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.500
controller.

99
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.900
Controller dot claire.

100
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.740
Okay, now is culture and sase.

101
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.930
Okay.

102
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.370
And now we can see.

103
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.630
I love.

104
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.110
It's like, hey, they can't send.

105
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.220
You can see and it's going to be displayed here.

106
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.170
And you can see over here, this is not some minutes ago, some minutes ago, and this is a minutes

107
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.590
ago.

108
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.570
So this is basically what time call does.

109
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.860
You can see how beautiful and cool the package is.

110
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.930
Okay, great.

111
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.350
And now we are able to display all our fields.

112
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.900
Right.

113
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.340
Okay.

114
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.360
Now we are able to post comments as well if it is seen as good.

115
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.060
Okay, guys, see you in the next that.
