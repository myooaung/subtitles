00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:08.039
Now, in order to make our code more efficient, we are going to be talking about something known as

4
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.570
state management.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.780
And in order to use state management, we are going to be using one of the most popular recommended

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050
package known as provider.

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.720
Okay, so now what you have to do is to head up to your browser and head up to pop dot dev.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.800
And over here we are going to search for provider.

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.070
Okay.

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.180
And you have to click on this first link over here.

11
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.820
And the next step is to copy this code and add back to your voice code and then your post back dot yaml

12
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.820
file and you can see I already have it.

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.130
All right.

14
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.760
Okay.

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.350
And now back to the lead directory.

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.140
We are going to create a new folder and we are going to call this folder pro Vidar.

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.220
Okay.

18
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.780
Now, basically what we want to do is to create the functionality in order to enable users being able

19
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.840
to have the item to the account.

20
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.770
So it's in the provider within the provider directory.

21
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.090
We are then going to create a new file and we can call this five cards or maybe cards on the score provider

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.790
and then go dot and we can use control and B to make this wide OC.

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.530
And now the first step is to create a class and we can call this class cards or maybe cards provider.

24
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.030
And we have to extend from something known as change notifier.

25
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.010
What this will basically do is it will listen to the changes the user is making to the cards.

26
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.340
That is, if they are incrementing the cards or documenting the cards.

27
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.860
So what this change notifier will do is it will listen for that changes the user is making to that card

28
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.950
and update it real time OC.

29
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.410
And now what we then have to do is to create a variable and we can just go ahead and specify it is a

30
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.620
type of learner and it is also a type of list because definitely users are going to be able to have

31
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.190
multiple products to the account.

32
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.130
Right.

33
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.160
And it is also a type of the products model.

34
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.330
Okay.

35
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.250
This is the product model with some of the models dietary and this is the model we are referring to.

36
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.850
Okay.

37
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.440
And now we can call this label on this call list and default.

38
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.180
We are going to set this list to equal and see since we do not have any product added.

39
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.990
So our cars at this stage continue to be.

40
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.190
And you can see currently what we simply did was to create a variable sorry, not a variable, but the

41
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.870
class was to create a class called class provider.

42
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.280
And we are extending from something known as chained notifier.

43
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.290
And like I said, what this would basically do is it will listen for changes we are making to our cards

44
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.180
and update it real time.

45
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.360
And over here we created a variable called on the score list, which is a private right and it is a

46
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.520
type of products model.

47
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.350
And definitely users are going to be able to have multiple products with their cards.

48
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.920
Right.

49
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.650
So it is also a type of list.

50
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.130
And you can see currently we make this table private, right.

51
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.440
And because of this, we cannot assess this variable outside this file.

52
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.020
So now what we can do is we can create another variable to override this.

53
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.340
To do that, we are going to be talking about something known as Kita.

54
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.270
Okay.

55
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.610
All we just have to say is to specify, again, that this variable is a type of list and also the type

56
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.250
of the products product model.

57
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.880
And we have to say get and we are then going to call this variable get items.

58
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.380
Items.

59
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.260
And all we just have to say is return on the score list.

60
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.230
On the score list.

61
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.870
Okay.

62
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.070
So now what we are basically doing is we are using this over here to override this.

63
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.440
Okay, great.

64
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.480
And what we can also do, we can get the length of how many products has been added to our cards.

65
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.390
To do that, we have to create another getter and we can just go ahead and specify.

66
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.080
We are expecting a number.

67
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.850
So this is going to be a type of eight and get and we can call this getter count and all we just have

68
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.250
to say is on the score list.

69
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.770
Then at length and over here we could also specify it can be no or make it no label.

70
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.540
Okay, great.

71
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:06.430
And now we can then create a function to hard item to our cards.

72
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.620
To do that, we can create a void.

73
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.510
And we are going to call this function hide hard item.

74
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.370
Sorry for my English.

75
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.910
Okay.

76
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.230
Item.

77
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.180
Sorry.

78
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.860
Parentheses and this.

79
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.110
Okay.

80
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.830
Now, within the parentheses, what we have to do is to pass the fields.

81
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.130
We want to heart along to our cards.

82
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.880
And the field is going to be this product model field.

83
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.610
So what we can just do is we can copy all of this or we can just add this one by one.

84
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.150
Okay.

85
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.540
The first field we want is going to be string name, comma and double.

86
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.560
Double prize.

87
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.060
Right.

88
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.710
And.

89
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.180
And quantity.

90
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.290
Quantity and.

91
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.530
List.

92
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.360
At least this is going to be image your URL list image.

93
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.870
List.

94
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.000
Image.

95
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.570
Image r l sorry.

96
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.960
Image.

97
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.900
Image what you are l.

98
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.470
Okay.

99
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.130
We also want the.

100
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.850
This is going to be string and document.

101
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.870
The comment, I'd.

102
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.780
And lastly, I think this is going to be a string.

103
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.140
Seller ID.

104
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.950
Sorry for that vibration.

105
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.860
Is control necessary and you can just have it.

106
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.130
These are all the fields we want to add to our cards or we want to have when the user is holding a product

107
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.210
to their cards.

108
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.400
Right.

109
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.380
Okay, so we turn this parenthesis.

110
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.350
Now, all we just have to say is to create a finer.

111
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.110
And we are going to call this product.

112
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.400
So.

113
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.200
Products.

114
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.220
And it's going to be equal to the products model products.

115
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.600
You can see it automatically pass all these fields and you can see what's in the parenthesis.

116
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.370
It's basically just use all the data we have over here.

117
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.280
Right.

118
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.790
Okay.

119
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.680
Okay.

120
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.070
Sorry.

121
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.020
I think we're missing this in stock.

122
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.890
Okay.

123
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.250
So we have to have that right.

124
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.830
Okay.

125
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.570
Ain't in stock.

126
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.530
Okay.

127
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.130
This is basically it.

128
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.670
And.

129
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.140
Although you image your URL.

130
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.760
Images.

131
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.620
Sorry, there's going to be images.

132
00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.990
Okay.

133
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.900
And check.

134
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.840
Okay.

135
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.400
Images.

136
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.030
Well.

137
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.050
Over in this segment at least can be assigned to.

138
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.260
I think we made it.

139
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.180
Once we made its list.

140
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.670
And I think over here, we're just going to check that quickly.

141
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.300
Sorry.

142
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.920
We have to change this.

143
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.650
This is going to be this list of image lists.

144
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:28.920
Right.

145
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.420
Okay.

146
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.110
And let's see, four other heroes and why we need this.

147
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.000
And this is basically it.

148
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.789
Okay.

149
00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.340
And all we just have to say now is to call the on the score.

150
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.020
Least agreeable.

151
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.090
And Dodd had.

152
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.410
Right.

153
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.810
And we want to have the product.

154
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.830
This product.

155
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.170
Right.

156
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.750
Okay.

157
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.990
And this and lastly, we have to call something known as notify listing.

158
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.510
So listing for the changes the user is making.

159
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.080
And this is basically it.

160
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.770
Right over here.

161
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.660
We created a class which we call the cards provider, and we are extending from something known as State

162
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.250
Notifier, which we basically listen to changes we are making.

163
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.880
And we created a variable called underscore list.

164
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:31.110
It is a type of product and definitely we are going to be able to add multiple items to our cards.

165
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.070
So it is a type of list.

166
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:33.640
Right.

167
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.560
And you can see currently we made it on the score, which means we cannot assess this variable outside

168
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.470
this file, which means it is a private and we want to be able to assess it outside this file.

169
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:51.490
So what we did was to create another variable or a guitar called get items.

170
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.640
And what we basically did was to override this.

171
00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.990
So instead of calling this outside this file, we have to call this get items and basically the list

172
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.990
has a return to get item has, right.

173
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.850
Because we are basically just overriding.

174
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.240
Right.

175
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.740
Okay.

176
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:14.620
And we also wanted to get the the how many products has been added to our cart.

177
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.610
So what we did was to create another getter and we call this count.

178
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.100
And what we simply just said was to say a list on the score lens.

179
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.980
On the score list.

180
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.910
Sorry.

181
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.090
And you know, that's so hard item to cut.

182
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:37.900
We created a function called hard item and once we basically did was to pass all the fields we want

183
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.450
to be added to the cart.

184
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:47.650
And one of the fields we need is the name, the price, the quantity, the stock, the image URL, the

185
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:53.620
document ID and the string, the sorry, the seller UID.

186
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:59.650
And over here we created on that variable called products and is equal to the product model.

187
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.520
Right.

188
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.470
And we were able to pass in all these fields over here.

189
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.460
And what we are simply doing is we call the underscore list.

190
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:17.500
Then we are adding that product to our cart and over here we are calling the notify listing to check

191
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.580
for that changes.

192
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:18.990
Okay.

193
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.290
Hopefully you understand.

194
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.030
But if we don't, you can do what?

195
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.630
Let me know.
