00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:02.110
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.800
Walker.

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.900
Not when users are trying to create an account.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.960
Definitely they're going to be hero.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.070
Right.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.330
But other now the user is not going to know where the hero is coming from.

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.670
Like what they are not doing.

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.060
Right.

9
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.450
Okay.

10
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.240
So what you're going to do in this lecture is you're going to create a snack bar that is going to pop

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.670
out that area, sort of like, hey, your email is badly formatted or your password is too short.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.090
Okay, so that's what you're going to do in this lecture.

13
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.510
Okay.

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.400
Now we can create this.

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.300
We can create a new fight for this because they're going to be using the snack bar a lot.

16
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.270
All we can.

17
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.400
You can just do it here.

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.370
We're still going to use it.

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.550
Even if we do it here.

20
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.980
Okay.

21
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.410
Probably in the future, you're going to have a more clean up code.

22
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.730
So for now.

23
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:07.220
We are just going to do it outside the class so we don't have to call the hot country like when we want

24
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.820
to use it.

25
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.250
Okay.

26
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.630
Great.

27
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.280
So now what you're going to do, you're going to create a functional call to show snack or the can still

28
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.280
show snack bar.

29
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.060
Okay.

30
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.870
Then.

31
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.670
This is going to take the boot.

32
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.090
The U.S. Capitol bill.

33
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.570
Contest.

34
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.950
So it's going to take in the contest.

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.080
Then it is a type of beauty contest as well.

36
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.880
It's going to take in the content.

37
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.400
Content, right.

38
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480
And it's going to be a type of this is a test.

39
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.370
So is the type of.

40
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.270
String.

41
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.260
Okay.

42
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.460
Audio train the coma.

43
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.000
Okay.

44
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.510
Good.

45
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.680
Now the next time you're going to do it, not to pop out message.

46
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.350
I believe you're not as captured.

47
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.100
It's comfort.

48
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.350
Scott Ford message or thought of contest, then you're going to say dots.

49
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.360
Snack.

50
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.810
Sure.

51
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.400
Sorry, that's just snack bar.

52
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.330
Okay.

53
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.820
There's going to be snack.

54
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.730
But I again, okay.

55
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.870
Now is asking for the content.

56
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.130
For the content.

57
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.750
This is going to be a test.

58
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.790
Right.

59
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.330
They are going to pass in the context because in the future.

60
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.030
Because you cannot make these dynamics.

61
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.820
We can pass in different, different tests.

62
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.210
Okay, great.

63
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.750
So this is basically it.

64
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.280
Now you're going to use this.

65
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.150
Function.

66
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.050
Okay, not to use this.

67
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.540
We're going to go to our.

68
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.980
We're going to go to our sign up.

69
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.660
Okay.

70
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.540
Now we're going to we needing to use the final statement.

71
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.560
So what you're going to do?

72
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.680
I'm going to create a new function in order to be able to have access to the if I'm else over this widget,

73
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.590
we can't use it on house statements.

74
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.780
So what we're going to do or what we are going to do is you're going to call this off.

75
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.770
From here.

76
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.340
Music, the everything.

77
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.820
Right.

78
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.070
So everything would say, okay, copy.

79
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.390
Then did it.

80
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.050
Okay, now, for now we're just going to do this like this.

81
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.730
So what we can do.

82
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.910
Over here, we can create a function whereby the reason for this is able to use the funhouse.

83
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.740
Okay.

84
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.930
So we can call this a sign.

85
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.690
Sign of user.

86
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.760
Okay.

87
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.040
As well is going to be sync because easy awaits.

88
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.980
So now we can.

89
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.120
Is this okay?

90
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.290
Okay, great.

91
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.390
Now I just want this control and this.

92
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.970
That's a very good format.

93
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.670
You can easily just type this yourself.

94
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.610
In case you probably did not copy it.

95
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.149
Where this is just odd allow that is a class we created.

96
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.110
Then the dogs in the function which is called sign up users.

97
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.480
They just had to pass in others.

98
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.550
That is a full name because you are going to get the value of the full name, the value of the user

99
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.480
name and all this.

100
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.770
Okay, great.

101
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.160
Now we can store this in every record.

102
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.240
Whereas.

103
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.610
And this is going to be it tests isn't the a type of string.

104
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.330
Okay.

105
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.900
Now the reason for this is so are able to use it is an error statement, right?

106
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.250
So what we can do now, we can say you.

107
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.340
If West is not equal to.

108
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.970
This is if it is not the, quote, resources available, they will pass in.

109
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.880
We said.

110
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.240
Rest is.

111
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.650
I think there is a first.

112
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.510
We said okay.

113
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.230
We said race is equal to success.

114
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.220
That is, if it has successfully created the user.

115
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.700
Right.

116
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.640
Okay.

117
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.350
Who said is going to print this?

118
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.220
We just simply said race or sources.

119
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.280
So if it is equal to size, if it is equal to sources, it means we have successfully created.

120
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.010
That's user words over here.

121
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.820
We are saying if it is not equal to success, okay, if it is not equal to success, then we want to

122
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.000
return that function which we created, which is called your snack.

123
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.930
I cannot ask you for the content.

124
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.580
That's the test.

125
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.350
They've always did it like this, so we are able to pass it dynamically.

126
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.000
Now for the test we can.

127
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.330
It is an exhaustive search and we're also going to use the rest.

128
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.730
So to give us the sources of some of the sources, because the condition is, if it is not equal to

129
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.210
say if it is not equal to sources, it means there is an issue.

130
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.640
So it's going to return the.

131
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.460
Riss.

132
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.430
Okay.

133
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.450
That is the hero.

134
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.720
Okay.

135
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.580
Now we're going to have.

136
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.450
Okay.

137
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.160
Now we can also use.

138
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.240
Else we can see else if it is equal to success.

139
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.570
Right.

140
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.030
Then as well, we want to do it on.

141
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.610
Their show.

142
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.760
Snap.

143
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Therefore, the contents of your second.

144
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.180
Call Con.

145
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.940
Congratulations.

146
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.010
Accounts.

147
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.090
As being created for you.

148
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.260
Okay.

149
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.100
Great.

150
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.760
Now I'm going to use contributions to save.

151
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.530
Okay.

152
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.220
Good.

153
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.240
Now, I'm just going to have to start.

154
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.700
I think we are having an issue this over.

155
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.650
That is why we can't see it as well.

156
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.980
So I think we need to hide the semicolon.

157
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.550
Okay.

158
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.450
SC Then you're going to give this a whole three starts.

159
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.290
So orders on the orders on sale twice actually be saved.

160
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.460
Okay.

161
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.590
Okay.

162
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.940
Okay, okay, okay.

163
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.280
Okay.

164
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.630
Otherwise, I see.

165
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.370
Now he's going to take us back to the login page.

166
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.210
Okay.

167
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.580
Now you're going to go back to the single page.

168
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.900
Okay.

169
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.660
I will try to click on the register.

170
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.360
Okay.

171
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.200
I think something is wrong is not.

172
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.450
It's hard to say.

173
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.750
Okay.

174
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.380
Let's go to check.

175
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.420
We are not using the function.

176
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.230
Oh, that is a very big issue, mate.

177
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.090
That is the issue.

178
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.550
We are not using the function.

179
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.410
So we're going to get rid of this.

180
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.480
We're going to call the function sign off.

181
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.650
You can see how how it a lot of time trying to it.

182
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.740
You're going to get rid of that.

183
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.860
We don't actually need it.

184
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.350
Okay.

185
00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:32.730
Okay.

186
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.440
Now this register.

187
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.490
Okay, great.

188
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.909
You can see the email address is badly formatted.

189
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.100
Now we can just all three stages.

190
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.260
You can see how that took a lot of time.

191
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.590
Sometimes you'd want to create it first before you want to create the function for us.

192
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.660
That is, give it a name before creates.

193
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.420
And that's actually one of the functions.

194
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.830
Okay, we're going to go to this.

195
00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.570
Okay.

196
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.950
Click on this is going to say please enter.

197
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.760
All these fields must not be empty.

198
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.160
Okay.

199
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.350
I think this video is getting so long.

200
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.310
I'm just going to stop here and in this picture, we're going to use some more explanation.
