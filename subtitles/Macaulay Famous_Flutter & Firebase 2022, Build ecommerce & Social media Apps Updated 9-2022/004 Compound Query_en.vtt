00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.770
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.770
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.070
In this lecture, we are going to talk about compound query.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.870
Now, what this basically means is in the future, we are going to have a lot of products from various

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.190
categories.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.700
Now what we want to do is we want to be able to filter just for the main category and just for the women

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.360
categories and just for the shoes categories.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.660
Right.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.110
Okay.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.800
So this is known as compound query.

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.310
Okay.

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.630
To do this, we have to head back to our verse code and use control and B to make this wide.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.250
We are in the main gallery screen and we have to screw up and over.

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.270
Yet you can see we have this firebase for Aster Dot instance, dot collection and products.

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.920
That is the name of our collection.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.100
And you can see we have that over a year.

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.560
Okay.

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.520
So what we could also do, we can use compound query for this over here, we can say dots.

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.710
Thought Where?

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.220
Okay.

21
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.640
That way.

22
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.000
You can see he's asking for the field.

23
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.270
We can then see where this main category.

24
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.000
You can see we have this main category.

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
We have this main category.

26
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.330
Do newcomer is is equal to the men value.

27
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.170
Okay.

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.920
And this is basically it.

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.630
What this will do.

30
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.150
It will go into the product collection.

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.890
So fetch all products where the main category is equal to this main value.

32
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.020
So it's really going to fetch the products relating to men and to do for the women.

33
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.010
All you just have to do is to copy this code and this is going to be women category is equal to women

34
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.810
and that's how you are going to do for all the categories.

35
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.039
Okay.

36
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.830
You can see how is this is okay.

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.850
And now just men are going to be displayed here and I think we have just one products for now and that

38
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.950
product is basically for men.

39
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.730
Okay.

40
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.690
What about.

41
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.610
Instead of men, we could say.

42
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.860
Maybe women to see what is going to happen in this country and save.

43
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.020
And you're not going to see this product anymore because this is a for the women category.

44
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.480
And you won't see and the product over again.

45
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.610
Okay.

46
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.020
We just have to how to start this, right?

47
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.790
Because we made changes over here.

48
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.340
And it's going to take some time to poetry starts and you just have to log in again to see it.

49
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.790
Okay.

50
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.750
Back to.

51
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.690
The seller, and I'm just going to log into my store.

52
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.540
Seamless store gmail dot com.

53
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.940
And the password is this.

54
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.830
And log in.

55
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.620
Okay.

56
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.100
And you can see it's currently trying to fetch the products and nothing shows up because we do not have

57
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.210
any products yet for that category.

58
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.040
And even if we have the products for women category, we do not really need to display that women category

59
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.920
or category product over year, but over year.

60
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.720
Right.

61
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.210
You can just create that screen and upload women products.

62
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.420
And now you can say we have no products.

63
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.100
Right.

64
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:11.620
So what we could also do, we can check if there is no data for that category, we then want to maybe

65
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.300
return the test over year, which is going to say this category is this category is empty.

66
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.070
Okay.

67
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.100
To do that.

68
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.200
Over here.

69
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.720
We can have another if statement.

70
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.940
We can then say Snapshot.

71
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.430
Snapshot.

72
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.900
DOT data.

73
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.740
Dot.

74
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.270
Doc Doc's dot is empty.

75
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.450
Right.

76
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.160
Okay.

77
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.480
If it is empty, we then want to return.

78
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.710
Basically, we're just going to return a test we get.

79
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.120
Or maybe we can just return the center to take the test to the center and chart.

80
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.430
There's going to be a test which at.

81
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.920
And.

82
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.190
It's going to say your maybe.

83
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.520
Maybe this.

84
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.580
This.

85
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.880
Category.

86
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:27.600
We can just use this backslash and backslash and to take the next test to the bottom, we can just say

87
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.220
this category has.

88
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.470
No, no.

89
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.790
Item.

90
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.530
Yes.

91
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.590
Okay.

92
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.760
This and we can just go ahead and start this.

93
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.750
This STI.

94
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.420
Okay.

95
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.350
We can then say caller and this is going to be callers that maybe callers that maybe blue gray.

96
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.740
Blue gray.

97
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.460
Okay.

98
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.330
And we can just increase the font size.

99
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.460
Sorry.

100
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.920
Font size, maybe 30.

101
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.490
And for tweets.

102
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.030
May be phones with.

103
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.510
The boat.

104
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.070
Okay.

105
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.680
And over here, we also don't need a newcomer.

106
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:28.200
So if there is no product for that category, we want to display this test, and I think we need an

107
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.790
additional parenthesis.

108
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.730
Okay.

109
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.480
And go check it out.

110
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.710
You can see this category has no item yet.

111
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.990
And this is for the men, right?

112
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.360
So we have to change this back to man and just control is to save.

113
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.520
Okay.

114
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.470
Okay.

115
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.230
For some reasons.

116
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.000
Can just to go back to this.

117
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.860
Okay.

118
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.380
You can see now since.

119
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.940
Good.

120
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.960
Sims.

121
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.710
Good waiting for the image.

122
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.340
I think I have a poor network connection is there.

123
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.590
So what you could just do is to upload a lot of products for the main category in order to spice this

124
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.850
main screen.

125
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.160
And also what you can just do is to create a new screen over the gallery.

126
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.690
You can just call this new screen women.

127
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.170
Let's go.

128
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.160
Gallery.

129
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.840
Gallery.

130
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.940
Gallery.

131
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.940
Screen door, dots.

132
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.690
And what you simply have to do is to copy this gold and paste it over here.

133
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.770
Right, and change the name of the class.

134
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.170
And you have to head back to the home screen and.

135
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.700
Get rid of what?

136
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.030
Of this and use that.

137
00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.460
Sorry.

138
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.130
Not there.

139
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.930
Get rid of this.

140
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.340
And is that right?

141
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.600
And remember, you also have to change.

142
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.100
The main category is going to be equal to women.

143
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.480
And you just have to do that for all the categories you have.

144
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.720
You can see we have for the women and kids shoes and you can have a lots.

145
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.910
You can just have a lots.

146
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.290
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
