00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.110
Our guys work.

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.150
In this section, we are going to be able to search for products.

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.940
In order to do this, we have to go to the inner screens directory and then the search underscore screen,

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.230
dot, dot file.

5
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:27.220
And the first step is to create a variable which is going to store whatsoever inputs the user is going

6
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.400
to type in year over year.

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.140
We can just go ahead and specify it is a type of string and we can call this variable such inputs and

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.810
for now we can just give it an empty string.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.670
Okay, now we send the Cupertino's search test field.

10
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.670
It has a property we should send before it is known as unchanged.

11
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.360
And it's going to take in the value which is basically referring to the actual inputs.

12
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.160
That is the F and in the future we are going to be able to update the UI.

13
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.660
And in order to update the UI, we need to convert the stateless widget to a stateful widget, a light

14
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.560
and use control dots, then convert to stateful widgets.

15
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.130
Okay.

16
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.810
And now we can then set state.

17
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.970
Said State.

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.100
Set states and then we can assign the search.

19
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.900
Imputes to Ecuador the value.

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.500
Okay.

21
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.650
And now we are going to be using a stream builder in order to display the best product.

22
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.830
To do this, we have to go back to our browser and then head up to Firebase, dot flutter, dot dev.

23
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.260
And over here we are going to search for the one time read.

24
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.300
But as you know, the one time rate is basically referring to the future beta.

25
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.210
So we are going to be using the.

26
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.140
Sorry, not.

27
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.880
Yeah, I'm just going to go back again.

28
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.330
Okay.

29
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.720
One time we'd.

30
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.720
Okay.

31
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.740
Like I said, remember the one time Reed is basically referring to the future.

32
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.950
But we are going to be using the real time changes, which is referring to the Stream Buddha.

33
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
Alright, we can copy from here to this spot.

34
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.940
Okay.

35
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.490
I'm just going to go down a bit.

36
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.690
So you see, it's clearly tense here.

37
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.160
And as you know, within the scaffold, it's as a property known as body.

38
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.070
And now we can paste this.

39
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.410
Is contrary to bits and make this wide.

40
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.750
And now we have same parts all this.

41
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.250
Okay.

42
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.230
In path.

43
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.500
Okay.

44
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.290
And I think we have to get rid of this.

45
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.840
Okay.

46
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.580
And as you know, the stream is basically referring to the source of the data.

47
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.330
Right.

48
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.630
So what we can then do is get rid of this and we can then say, Firebase faster.

49
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.260
Sabah is faster.

50
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.680
Sorry for a stir.

51
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.090
Which if for a prediction.

52
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.880
Okay Dot stands then dot collection and we want to have access to the products collection and we then

53
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.660
have to say snapshot either trying to cover.

54
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.130
And for now we can get rid of this list time.

55
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.210
We're going to have it again very soon.

56
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.560
And over here.

57
00:03:51.710 --> 00:04:01.190
We are then going to create a finite variable and we can call this variable search resource.

58
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.600
Okay is going to be equal to snapshot.

59
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.770
Snapshot.

60
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.230
Snob shirt.

61
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.980
So it's snapshot dot data.

62
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.839
Then the docs did remember the docs is basically referring to each product we have in the product collection

63
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.750
and I think we need this.

64
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.840
And we are then going to go further by saying those where what we are basically saying now is we want

65
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.000
to compare the search.

66
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.010
Impute that is whatsoever.

67
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.650
This is going to type in here with the product name.

68
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.260
Okay.

69
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.680
So instead of this, we can get rid of this arrow function and use this.

70
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.410
And instead of this long element, we can get rid of everything here and leave that e and at this.

71
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.940
And now we can return and we are going to say we are the E.

72
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.500
Then product's name.

73
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.260
Dots contains.

74
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.360
You can see we are not getting any of the prediction dots contains.

75
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.180
Search.

76
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.240
Imputes.

77
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.330
Okay.

78
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.720
Such.

79
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.910
That is, if we are searching for Gucci and if the search says Gucci.

80
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.690
We want to show only the product name that's relating to Gucci.

81
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.070
That's what we're basically saying.

82
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.600
And I think we need this.

83
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.480
This and this is basically it.

84
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.090
And now what we have to do is we can return a list view.

85
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.470
At least for you.

86
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:53.810
And at this now within the list view you can see this this view as something that is very similar to

87
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.920
that of the column.

88
00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.890
It has the property known as children and we can get rid of this.

89
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.230
And what we then have to do is to map over each search results.

90
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.820
We have to do this or we just have to say is to call the search results.

91
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.390
Such resort.

92
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.120
Search Results.

93
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:24.520
NW Dot map like it's going to take in the it's going to take in the E.

94
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.100
Okay.

95
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:36.390
Get rid of this and we can break this down to the next line and then we can then return maybe.

96
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.860
Maybe we can just return a row for now.

97
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:49.200
And also, I think we have to convert this to at least I think all via dots to list.

98
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.170
I'm just going to show you this again over here.

99
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.470
Okay.

100
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.690
We can then say dart to list.

101
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.310
Okay, great.

102
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.830
And as you know, the euro has a property known as children.

103
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.310
And for the children, it's going to be a size box because basically we want to display the image first

104
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:17.190
size box, and we can give this size box the idea of maybe hundred and a width.

105
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.590
Or maybe Android.

106
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.590
Okay.

107
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.660
And you can then have a child.

108
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.530
We can then have a child.

109
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.510
I think we need this.

110
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.630
Get rid of this.

111
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.820
Sorry.

112
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.400
But when this is what are missing.

113
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.720
Over.

114
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.520
This is your.

115
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.840
Just go and do this.

116
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.880
Okay.

117
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.310
And that this we can then have a child which is going to be image that network.

118
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.260
Network.

119
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:05.150
And now this is going to be then we want to assess the product's image and overindexed to see what we

120
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.990
are missing.

121
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.480
I think we need this other train camera and use control and save.

122
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.940
And let's go check this out.

123
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.860
Okay.

124
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.060
Within.

125
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.880
Is not a subtype of string.

126
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.180
What could be the error?

127
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.390
Okay.

128
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:42.750
We also need to assess because this is a list of images, so we have to assess the first image only.

129
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.540
Okay.

130
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.360
This is going to sort it out now.

131
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.640
Okay.

132
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.930
Sims could.

133
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:52.870
Okay.

134
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.470
Let's search for the men over there.

135
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.540
Maybe men.

136
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.030
Just men clothes should be displayed.

137
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.230
Hmm.

138
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.620
I don't think we have any product such as men.

139
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.310
What can we do?

140
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.690
I think maybe.

141
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.840
Maybe women, and I think maybe men is inside.

142
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.730
So that's why you send this.

143
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.000
Okay.

144
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.830
What about iPhone?

145
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.430
You can see this in real time.

146
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.450
iPhone.

147
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.270
I think just iPhone is going to be displayed.

148
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.620
Okay.

149
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.720
I think we have a phone.

150
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.740
Phone?

151
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.170
Okay.

152
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.730
You can see just phone is being displayed.

153
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.690
Okay.

154
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.950
Sims Very cool.

155
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.840
Okay.

156
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.250
In the next lecture, we are just going to continue from here, and I'm going to try my best to explain

157
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.640
this a bit more clear.

158
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.510
Okay.

159
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.380
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
