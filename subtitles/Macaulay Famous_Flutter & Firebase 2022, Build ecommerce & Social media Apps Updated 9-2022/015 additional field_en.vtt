00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.730
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.320
WALKER In this lecture, we're going to have an additional field, which is going to be the phone number.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.750
Okay.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.270
Now, to do this, you're going to need to first go to the hearts controller.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.580
Okay.

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.630
That is the controllers for the.

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.020
Okay.

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.270
And now we can just control and be okay.

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.400
Now over here.

10
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.680
After this email address, we can say we want the phone number.

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.620
Please note the holder is very compulsory.

12
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.430
You're out of this.

13
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.220
Okay.

14
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.980
Over here.

15
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.070
We can also check we did this right after the image.

16
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.440
Right.

17
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.790
Okay.

18
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.240
So this is going to be phone number.

19
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.410
Phone number.

20
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.140
Number.

21
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.750
Dart is not.

22
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.070
And see.

23
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.240
Okay.

24
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.850
Because as I just have that hand over.

25
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.550
Okay.

26
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.750
Now, definitely, we're going to have some errors over the.

27
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.400
The sign up screen.

28
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.780
Okay?

29
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.640
Yeah.

30
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.010
We do.

31
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.520
Okay.

32
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.390
On this.

33
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.930
And then open it now.

34
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.610
Okay.

35
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.860
The first two ways, we can just go ahead and create the phone number controller.

36
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.570
Remember, what it's going to do is not give us access to the valued users for the time being.

37
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.960
Okay.

38
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.440
So it's going to be test and it's in controller or this call for number.

39
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.600
Number.

40
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.870
Controller.

41
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.170
It's required to test and detain.

42
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.750
Test it.

43
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.890
It's in the controller.

44
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.310
Okay.

45
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.500
Okay.

46
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.920
Great.

47
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.910
Now over here.

48
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.470
Okay we're going to do this right after the immune system and the underscore for.

49
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.850
Phone number, controller and value dot test.

50
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.290
Okay.

51
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.979
Not investing is to create that field.

52
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.490
Okay.

53
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.040
So what we can just do right after the email, we can just copy this and this and that as well.

54
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.100
Give space for it.

55
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.510
Okay.

56
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.190
Confidence and youth culture and see.

57
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.660
And is this over?

58
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.760
That is going to be entire.

59
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.390
Phone number.

60
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.820
Make sure you get rid of this as well, because if you don't, the email field value is going to be

61
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.960
attached to this.

62
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.350
Okay.

63
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.240
So this is maybe on a score.

64
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.780
For.

65
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.300
Number control.

66
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.820
Okay.

67
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.770
Now, one would say it is we need to store the data to defer these data bills.

68
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.010
Right.

69
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.050
So we're going to go back to the auto controller and scroll down over here.

70
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.780
You can then see foreign.

71
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.790
Number.

72
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.830
They'll be caught too often.

73
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.940
Number added to the cover.

74
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.400
And just after we started this.

75
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.700
Give.

76
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.970
Make sure you are too stuck.

77
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.350
Make sure you do it.

78
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.760
We start.

79
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.130
Okay.

80
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.740
Okay.

81
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.990
And sign up.

82
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.350
Right.

83
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.340
Okay.

84
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.250
Sign up here.

85
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.660
We can just pick this guy.

86
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.350
Pick this guy and.

87
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.610
For the record for the player, I can say.

88
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.060
Mark.

89
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.410
Mark.

90
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.480
Seven, G.M..

91
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.780
That call and mark.

92
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.370
737.

93
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:56.710
Got to email it's call for the email mark seven might seem real that's calm for the phone number.

94
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.710
Or you can just do okay for you now can just go like this.

95
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.800
We can either change the type.

96
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.130
Okay.

97
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.860
So the password is what it is.

98
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.450
Okay.

99
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.519
Now click on register because as I just pull out this, you know, that's a no.

100
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.209
Yes.

101
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.800
Creating it.

102
00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.510
Okay.

103
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.360
Okay.

104
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.240
This it over.

105
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.810
Okay.

106
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.980
Okay, great.

107
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.940
Now, this is a number.

108
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.330
Okay.

109
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.220
Now, what we can do is it's in the password.

110
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.070
The email is max seven.

111
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.430
Okay.

112
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.550
First of all, whatever the need to do is to go back to the sign up screen and.

113
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.890
Over here, we can say keyboard.

114
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.160
Keyboard.

115
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.680
So he.

116
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.690
Keyboard type, occasionally chests imputes type thoughts, we add the number.

117
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.510
The number is going to be if you choose the number as a number, you can select between number and text

118
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.440
by vessel.

119
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.080
To go it forwards is just going to be a phone imputes, but then you're going to see, okay.

120
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.650
Okay, great.

121
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.270
Now, the Knesset to do so this way is to fetch on the street.

122
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.050
Ed Right.

123
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.320
So I'm going to go back to the ice cream.

124
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.690
We'll fly a screen over it and.

125
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.760
As well.

126
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.290
Strange.

127
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.660
When the score for number.

128
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.330
Number.

129
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.570
Okay.

130
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.100
Then.

131
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.280
Well, I wanted to say on the score phone number.

132
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.750
Is the to user data that gets.

133
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.350
Okay.

134
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.290
There's going to be words.

135
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.770
Phone number.

136
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.110
Okay.

137
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.550
So we can just do.

138
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.790
Make sure you don't have that.

139
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.100
That's on this score as you're going to get it passed, etc., because that's not what you have in your

140
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.720
database.

141
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.060
Okay.

142
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.190
Now what we start is one more time I think we automatically go.

143
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.440
It's going to is going to take us to the log in.

144
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.740
It's going to take us to the home screen because of that, because of what we have in the media.

145
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.710
That's right.

146
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.470
Since we currently have data now.

147
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.820
Okay.

148
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.620
Why you?

149
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.130
She took us.

150
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.780
Okay, great.

151
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.670
It's what I plan.

152
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.930
Okay.

153
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.830
Okay.

154
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.390
We need to display that number.

155
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.560
I think we had that image to this.

156
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.510
Well, for some reasons we are not saying that.

157
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.890
Okay.

158
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.710
Record.

159
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.500
It's okay.

160
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.690
It's okay.

161
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.580
Okay.

162
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.920
We're going to go back to the proviso.

163
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.620
For five.

164
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.780
And then we need to displace.

165
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.990
Okay.

166
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.940
So this.

167
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.430
This.

168
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.270
This say this on the score for.

169
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.160
Number.

170
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.310
Okay.

171
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.940
Great.

172
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.110
Okay.

173
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.100
Okay.

174
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.240
Great.

175
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.690
Sounds good.

176
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.510
You can as well have some more.

177
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.830
This should not feel as if you want to.

178
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.250
If you just want to add, you can just re copy.

179
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.530
We copy and paste this and rename it to whatever you want to hide and change the number.

180
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.900
So probably five.

181
00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.320
Okay.

182
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:06.200
So you can just have as many as you want something like this and rename these to five and so.

183
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.960
Okay, great.

184
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.880
Okay, guys.

185
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.700
See in SEC.
