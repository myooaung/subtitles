00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.450
In this lecture, we are going to be able to update the favorite icon to have the full right icon.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
Whenever we had a product to our wish list.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:22.560
To do this, we have to go to the detail dietary and then the products on the score detail screen and

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
you can see why we have this icon widget.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.630
So what we can do is we can check if that product has already been added to our wish list.

8
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.650
If it has been added, then we want to show the right icon, which is going to have a red background

9
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.700
inside of it to do this.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.270
This is going to be very similar to what we have over here.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.140
Right.

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.300
Okay.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.840
So what we just have to do is over here, we are going to call the contest contest, then got read.

14
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.269
Then we basically want to have access to the witch list.

15
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.030
Provider.

16
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.460
And we have to say don't get get which items then dot first where or no.

17
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.780
And remember you can see this elements as a variable that stores all the fields or all the details we

18
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.840
have within the wish list provider class.

19
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.410
So over here we can just rename this to say which.

20
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.380
And get rid of this force.

21
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.060
And now we have access to all the details over there.

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.170
We can then say which dots, what document ID is equal to.

23
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.290
The.

24
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.090
The product list.

25
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.100
Product list.

26
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.070
And product ID.

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.760
For that, I'd.

28
00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.140
Is not equal to, nor if it is not equal to, nor it means it has already been hoarded.

29
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.070
Right.

30
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.140
Then we want to show.

31
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.340
Get rid of this.

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.860
I'm just going to copy it first.

33
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
The icons that Favre writes.

34
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.920
They?

35
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.640
Right.

36
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.720
Okay.

37
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.230
And get rid of this.

38
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.370
Look at the train camera.

39
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.620
Else we want to share.

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.350
Icon widgets.

41
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.420
Icons.

42
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.220
Dot pays this.

43
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.820
Okay.

44
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.400
Okay.

45
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.330
Sorry.

46
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.890
I just can't come here and use control and save and make sure you are in the customers accounts.

47
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.480
Else this might not work because just only customers do it.

48
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.980
This happy structure is structured.

49
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.500
Only customers are allowed to have product to their wish list.

50
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.160
Right.

51
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.680
Okay.

52
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.070
Okay.

53
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.000
And.

54
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.290
Currently we have this product in which let's not click on it again.

55
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.640
Okay.

56
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.200
Seems cool and click on it.

57
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.120
How did.

58
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.450
Right.

59
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.160
Because we are saying if if it has been hard that we want to show this full civil rights icon.

60
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.510
And let's go check to see if it's if it's really there.

61
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.070
Okay.

62
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.870
Consider that.

63
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.490
Okay, now let's click on it again.

64
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.670
Okay.

65
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.160
And.

66
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.280
Okay.

67
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.120
Remove it.

68
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.980
Okay.

69
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.940
Not going.

70
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.100
Okay.

71
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.030
What we can just do is in order to save us from errors with this rate, we can just use this watch and

72
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.820
get rid of this and just restart this.

73
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.190
But we start.

74
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.710
It's going to take some time to start because I think I've not done this for some while now.

75
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.460
And.

76
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.240
Okay.

77
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.360
Okay.

78
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.950
It's going to start this.

79
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.790
Okay.

80
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600
We have to log into the.

81
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.580
Customer accounts.

82
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.690
And I mean I think I have this at me I G.M. dot com.

83
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.100
Make sure the account is for the customer is a customer account.

84
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.700
Else it's not going to work as expected.

85
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.730
Okay.

86
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.630
And.

87
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.500
And.

88
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.090
And.

89
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.530
And.

90
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.210
And.

91
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.950
Okay.

92
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.010
Let's have a productive wish list to see.

93
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.860
Think I have had this.

94
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.890
Lots of them.

95
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.540
Okay.

96
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.820
Let's check to see what we're missing.

97
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.750
Okay.

98
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.330
Okay.

99
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.040
Okay.

100
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.110
Sorry.

101
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.230
I don't think it's yet.

102
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.950
It's going to.

103
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.300
Okay.

104
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.560
Skirt down.

105
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.230
Okay.

106
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.760
And I'm going to change this to watch.

107
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.390
Okay.

108
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.360
Get rid of that.

109
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.000
Okay.

110
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.650
This country needs to save.

111
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.010
And let's go try.

112
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.390
Okay.

113
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.350
Okay.

114
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.700
Already?

115
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.360
I did.

116
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.560
Okay.

117
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.880
Now let's start this.

118
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.960
So be sure everything is working as expected.

119
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.540
All three Sutton.

120
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.350
Okay.

121
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.750
And.

122
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.240
Sign up and log in.

123
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.060
Okay.

124
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.440
I mean, G.M. does calm the.

125
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.420
Log in and hopefully it's going to work with that error as we are basically saying.

126
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.370
Cortez watch then which this provider I believe we already know what this watch does.

127
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.110
Okay.

128
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.050
I think the it should also work because basically we just want to update this and not something other

129
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.660
from this.

130
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.910
Okay, click on this.

131
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.500
Okay, click on it again.

132
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.700
Okay.

133
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.080
Since school.

134
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.600
Some skill and the way you could also say watch.

135
00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.030
The watch basically has everything the reader has, but the reader does not have everything the watch

136
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.660
has.

137
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:08.100
So basically you can just change this to watch and it's going to work as what the expected compared

138
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.700
to using the read since the watch basically has everything the reader has and the read does not have

139
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.460
everything the watch has.

140
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.030
Or have.

141
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.520
Sorry for the English, but for you understand.

142
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.610
Okay, this is basically it.

143
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.220
And I'm just going to try this with another.

144
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.450
Under the products.

145
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.000
Okay.

146
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.520
This week on this had that click on it again.

147
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.140
Okay.

148
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.550
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
