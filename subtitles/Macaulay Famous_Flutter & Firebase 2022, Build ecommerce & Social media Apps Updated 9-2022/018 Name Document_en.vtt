00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.770
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.770
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.260
In this lecture, we are going to give our documents a name.

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.330
And the reason for this is because in the future, if we have.

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:22.670
Opt to order quantity and if a user purchased that products, what we want to do is to reduce that quantity

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.870
from hundred to 99 because we no longer have Andre item of that product, right.

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.320
We then have 99.

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.500
And in order to assess that products, that specific products the user as watches, we need access to

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.740
the name of the documents and you can see currently Flutter or Firebase is basically also generating

10
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.810
it for us.

11
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.750
So what we can do in order to have access to the documents ID that is the name of the documents or the

12
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.880
name of the product.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.450
We have to also generate the hides ourselves and to do that we need a package header to pop the dev.

14
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.560
And over here we are going to search for a package known as EU ID which would basically help us to generate

15
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.710
a unique ID for each product.

16
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.310
Click on this and you have to copy this code.

17
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.500
And head back to your post back dot yaml file and you can see currently.

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.290
Hi how with the OC.

19
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.530
And after you do that you can maybe also restart your via Xcode and but before you also start, definitely,

20
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.860
you know, you have to click on get packages or use control and as to save and after then some of the

21
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.040
time it is required you restart your voice code OC.

22
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.210
And now we have to use that back to the upload product and use controller and be okay.

23
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.320
What we can do first is over here we can create a variable.

24
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.840
It's going to be late because we are not giving it any value at this point.

25
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.490
And it's going to be a type of string and we can call this product ID.

26
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.640
Sorry.

27
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.290
Yeah.

28
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.510
Add your semicolon.

29
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.680
Okay.

30
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.790
And.

31
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.590
And.

32
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.430
Before year before I within what we can just do is call the product ID variable.

33
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.510
Product ID.

34
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.050
And we can then say is equal to that.

35
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.380
You.

36
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.960
You.

37
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.290
You.

38
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.040
You, Heidi.

39
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.790
We just installed your ID.

40
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.570
Sorry, your ID.

41
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.390
We also do have to call it.

42
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.360
I think contrary to what?

43
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.290
Okay.

44
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.020
And we have to import and we then have to say dot v for what this widget is.

45
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.370
It will help us generate a unique hide number.

46
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.260
So we send the product ref the dock.

47
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.710
We then have to say product ID.

48
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.310
Okay.

49
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.350
So this will then generate a unique high number for us.

50
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.310
And you can see now we can have access to the document by saying maybe a dock, then pass the product,

51
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.820
ID then get.

52
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.040
Okay, I think you've seen that before during the customer streaming of data.

53
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.560
Okay.

54
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.410
And within the set, we can pass an extra field which we are going to call a product ID and it's going

55
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.800
to be equal to this product ID.

56
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.430
And definitely you need to send me a sorry, a comma I can use container save and what we can just do,

57
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.850
we can delete this we already have.

58
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.020
Okay.

59
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.900
Because currently you can see we have another field, so you can just delete the collection.

60
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.529
Sorry.

61
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.060
Over here.

62
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.790
Deletes collection and it is called products.

63
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.530
That is the name of the collection.

64
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.670
Delete.

65
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.440
Okay.

66
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.860
Okay.

67
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.150
That's collection is delayed, and now we can then upload a product.

68
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.260
Upload.

69
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.740
Okay.

70
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.040
I'm just going to pick this to shirts.

71
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.620
Okay.

72
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.760
Peak this.

73
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:58.720
And this OC select and for the main category I'm going to say man and for the top category I would then

74
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.610
say jackets and for the price of the products I'm going to say 50 and for the quantity I can then say

75
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:16.750
60 and for the product name and then say jackets, jackets and for the description of the product,

76
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.870
I can just say best, best selling jacket.

77
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.130
Okay.

78
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.110
And now click on upload.

79
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.340
It will definitely take some time and make sure you are logged in because over here you can see we are

80
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:45.050
calling the Firebase Hotspot instance and the current user and we are basically getting the UID and

81
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.150
if you are not login you will have an error because you are calling this which has been logged in because

82
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.340
it expects you to be log in when calling the when trying to get the current user.

83
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.370
Okay.

84
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.590
And let's see, you can see currently everything has been reset, the images has been reset back to

85
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:14.330
empty and the select event category has also been reset and all the fields are reset as well.

86
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.650
Okay.

87
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.710
Let's go check and go to this and back to Data.

88
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.950
And you're going to see a new collection called Products.

89
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.540
And now we are basically generating it ourselves.

90
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.290
Okay.

91
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.340
And you can see now the discount is there.

92
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.500
We have on it.

93
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.540
In the future, we are going to be able to assess these documents in order to reduce it.

94
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.670
And we'll also have this in stock.

95
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.180
Okay.

96
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.420
Sorry, the discount is there.

97
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.400
The stock is 60 and the main category is men.

98
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.120
Right?

99
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.460
The price is 50, right?

100
00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.570
The product description is the best selling jacket and the product ID can see the product ID is this

101
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.990
as well.

102
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.450
You can see it is the same thing.

103
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.620
And remember, the document is basically referring to the name of the product that is the this.

104
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.230
You can just see this as this entire thing as a document, right?

105
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.320
So currently we can see we have one documents.

106
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.160
If we upload the lab product again, then we have to document and we feel if we upload the test product,

107
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.130
that means we have said document or three document.

108
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.770
Okay.

109
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.330
And currently we have just one document.

110
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.470
Right.

111
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.120
Okay.

112
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:40.450
And you can see everything is going well and I think I'll put that just to images or maybe three or

113
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.930
so.

114
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.370
Okay.

115
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.990
We are having multiple.

116
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:53.110
Images that we uploaded, I think we uploaded just to and currently we have multiple images.

117
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.750
We just have to stop here for now and we are going to resolve that maybe in the next section.
