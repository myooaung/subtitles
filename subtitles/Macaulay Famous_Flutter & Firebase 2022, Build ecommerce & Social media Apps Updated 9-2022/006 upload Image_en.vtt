00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.510
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.080
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.630
Now, this lecture, we are gonna applaud the perfect image to our fast database.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.670
But before we do this, I want to first upload the image to the storage.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.070
Now, in order to get to this page, I just have to do is to click on this storage.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.170
Now, you may not see this as a page.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.260
Well, whatever you see, I believe you're going to be able to follow the process.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.700
Okay.

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.350
Now, the important thing is to upload image over here on into the layer.

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.880
We need to as well set up what the rules.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.220
So navigate to the navigate to the rules tab.

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.050
Okay.

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.880
Okay.

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.910
Now, yours might not look exactly like this, but whatever it is you just have to do is to remove from

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.530
the back.

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.590
So the hello world.

17
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.310
All right.

18
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.310
Okay.

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.930
Make sure your semicolon is at the head.

20
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.810
Okay.

21
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.390
You're going to click on publish.

22
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.710
Okay.

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.480
Now, the logic is what we're going to do is, first of all.

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.310
They are going to upload the image.

25
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.990
So the storage.

26
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:26.270
Then we are going to get that image Jarrell then uploaded to the Presto database.

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay.

28
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.820
Now what you can do is over here, we can just create a folder.

29
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.150
Well, like I said, we're not gonna be doing this manually.

30
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.700
So we are going to go now to our.

31
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.480
We are quote.

32
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.960
They're going to do this in the hearts controller.

33
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.450
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this very wide by using control and the.

34
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.910
That over a year we had earlier created a function which required sign off users to sign up users.

35
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.600
Then we passed in all the required fields we need.

36
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.410
And over here we are checking if it is valid or not.

37
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.970
So we are simply saying if.

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.070
The full name, user name of the human fossil that emitted.

39
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.780
If all those fields are field, then only we want to create the user and as well we want to upload those

40
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.060
details to the past or the.

41
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.870
Okay.

42
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.450
Now what we are also going to do is we are not only going to create these are only going to create the

43
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.800
datas in the faster, but as well.

44
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.250
We are going to store that image and the evidence that affects image and the storage location.

45
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.730
Okay.

46
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.930
Now, to do this, what I just going to do is I'm going to do this before this class.

47
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.980
So that's collection recorded as well.

48
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.760
Simply just.

49
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.900
I wait for this?

50
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.610
Okay.

51
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.000
So now what you're going to do is we're going to create a function of a.

52
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.800
So we can't call this function.

53
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.430
Okay.

54
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.450
On this call.

55
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.550
So I'll just go offload.

56
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.070
Image of this disco two.

57
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.040
So.

58
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.580
So storage.

59
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.500
Okay.

60
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.650
Now.

61
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.380
What we can't do first is we can't just pass.

62
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.840
You can't pass.

63
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.880
The crew does all the emissions so they can see it because first of all, we need to pass this.

64
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.250
Okay.

65
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.540
Now we can associate this type of you.

66
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.360
It's.

67
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.700
It's a list.

68
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.830
So it's.

69
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.470
This.

70
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.040
Okay.

71
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.330
Then you can see.

72
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.810
It can be.

73
00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.170
No.

74
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.940
Okay.

75
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.850
I think we need to it in a coma.

76
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.020
Okay.

77
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.980
Now you can see it expects us to pass it to.

78
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.310
The food.

79
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.040
So now what you're going to do is.

80
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.610
They're going to say aren't.

81
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.060
Image.

82
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.100
Is not a core to know.

83
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.630
That is, if the images like what's in are, then only we want to.

84
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.790
Broad audience as well.

85
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.270
Okay.

86
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.220
Now we're going to pass into image.

87
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.360
Okay.

88
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.770
Now we're going to create this function with the code pages.

89
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.960
We're just going to create a function.

90
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.940
At the top.

91
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.920
So you can also give a comment because in function.

92
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.360
Function to.

93
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.830
Function to.

94
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.870
Image to storage.

95
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.880
Okay.

96
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.870
Now, what we can do first is remember we had earlier.

97
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.610
You can see this.

98
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.380
Fix it.

99
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.190
So that's what we're getting down here.

100
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.870
So now remember.

101
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.130
Okay.

102
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.760
We had earlier installed a storage as well.

103
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.120
Right.

104
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.740
So what we're going to do, we're going to go to our cost, just as it did this past week, as rid of

105
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.580
all those errors.

106
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.090
Okay.

107
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.440
So now we're going to call this Firebase Storage.

108
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.240
So this is going to be equal to Firebase.

109
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.670
Public storage third instance.

110
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.730
So.

111
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.740
Five is.

112
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.000
Okay.

113
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.800
That's his stance.

114
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.370
Okay.

115
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.630
Now we are going to go back to our controller.

116
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.420
Then what we're going to do is we're going to create that functional first.

117
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.000
Okay.

118
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.360
Then we get to the past and the.

119
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.970
MH Then this a type of you?

120
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.810
And.

121
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.480
It's this.

122
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.090
So it's.

123
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.750
Okay.

124
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.940
We can see it coming also.

125
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.060
Okay.

126
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.260
Great.

127
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.580
Now what you're going to do first is you're going to create a folder.

128
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.550
Now, as you know, you're not going to be creating this manually.

129
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.330
Okay.

130
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.880
So what you're going to do not to create that for the Firebase Storage.

131
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.480
Third wave, then the child.

132
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.870
Okay.

133
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.710
This child's name is the location of all of those images of his thought.

134
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.740
That is the folder of those images that are going to be stored.

135
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.660
We can call the for the four five takes.

136
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.240
Okay.

137
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.260
So.

138
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.970
Okay.

139
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.760
Then they're going to say the child again.

140
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.630
Now the child is referred to what is going to be the name of the Fae.

141
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.480
Now the name of the site is going to be the user ID.

142
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.170
Now we can use that to create over there because we are defining this first.

143
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.640
So what we can do is use the Firebase Odds to get the idea as well.

144
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.230
So I'm going to say Firebase.

145
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.320
Odd thoughts user, but so sorry this is going to be correct.

146
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.220
User turds.

147
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.330
You already had U.S. permission, McKelvey.

148
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.200
Okay, great.

149
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.280
Now we can store the results in a verbal code with.

150
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.410
Okay.

151
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.750
There is a type of Faroes.

152
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.700
With the Browns now.

153
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.950
This is it.

154
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.920
We have created it for the court for five, six, four, five.

155
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.040
Think then we said the name of the.

156
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.660
Fire is going to be the user.

157
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.680
Heidi?

158
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.180
Okay, great.

159
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.180
So not in this scene.

160
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.620
We're going to do a service to upload the image.

161
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.160
So to do that.

162
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.790
Oh, just out to do it is this.

163
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.450
Rev it.

164
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.220
We have dirt.

165
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.590
It's we have put data, right?

166
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.090
We have the put data class in that image.

167
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.280
Okay.

168
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.240
Great.

169
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.440
Kraft Foods did a.

170
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.560
That's in crickets in this era.

171
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.220
Okay.

172
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.970
Good.

173
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.180
Now most of the results in the variable.

174
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.750
So you're going to store the results on the record.

175
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.210
So for that record upload task.

176
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.920
Because you're going to upload it once, upload the image to defer storage rights and is also going

177
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.590
to be a type of upload task.

178
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.520
So we're going to watch this.

179
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.120
Okay, great.

180
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.260
Right.

181
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.390
Okay.

182
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:43.100
Now what we're going to do, this is going to wait for the upload in upload task, if you do understand

183
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.280
is.

184
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.700
Absolutely.

185
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.230
I want to continue this again.

186
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.450
Right.

187
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.820
Okay.

188
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:48.660
As well.

189
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.950
We need to store this in the cold snap.

190
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.660
Which is a type of tax.

191
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.380
Snapshots.

192
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:02.850
Okay.

193
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:05.920
Okay.

194
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.470
So there are forces that we need to use.

195
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.030
What's the async?

196
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.010
Okay.

197
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.590
It's already ten days in the lodge code.

198
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.600
Okay, now, remember I said we're going to get there.

199
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.650
You have a hill of the inmates there and you're going to upload it over there right now to do this.

200
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.810
Just out as it is.

201
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.810
Snap that.

202
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.670
Snapped.

203
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.680
This is going to be, I think.

204
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.750
Okay.

205
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.560
There's going to be stuff that read.

206
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.110
Then don't get the load.

207
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.890
You are a hill.

208
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.440
Okay.

209
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.580
Now as well, we can store this in the variable code.

210
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.680
Download.

211
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.360
Download the URL.

212
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.060
Okay.

213
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.270
So we're going to need to with this then.

214
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.400
This is a type of string.

215
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.190
Right.

216
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.400
That and this they're going to do is they're going to return.

217
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.950
Return to the Lord Jarrell.

218
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:15.850
Okay.

219
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.480
Great.

220
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.940
So this is basically it.

221
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.570
First of all, we created the for the court.

222
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.670
So if I peek then with the name of the is going to be the user uid.

223
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:33.010
Then over here is just to upload that image, right?

224
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.860
Then over here we are waiting for the upload.

225
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.440
Then over here we got the.

226
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.820
Download we got the image URL and we're return it.

227
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.940
Okay, so now I'm just going to stop here.

228
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.600
Then this lecture will continue.
