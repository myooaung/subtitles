00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.520
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.940
Now, when a user clicks on this product, we are gonna take the user back to the detail page of that

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.470
product.

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.580
And as well, users are going to be able to click on this plus icon in order to increment the upper

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.020
depths.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.440
Okay.

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.260
Now, to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VSC code and then the cart item screen.

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.890
Okay.

10
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.040
Now we're going to use Control and B to make this way.

11
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.100
First of all, we're going to make this clickable.

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.310
So to do that, all this container to wrap it with a button so I light and then use control and dot.

13
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.580
Now, since we don't have that widget every year, we can then go for the drop widget and it's going

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.420
to be a type of.

15
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.860
Just a picture.

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.460
Okay.

17
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.600
And as you know, the guest editor has a property known as on tap.

18
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.760
Okay.

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.190
Now we're going to use this we should said before we could just say navigator dot.

20
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.680
Push, push name.

21
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.750
You can seize it as well.

22
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.230
Take the contest.

23
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.160
Okay.

24
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.180
For the roots name.

25
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.320
This is going to be detail.

26
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.380
Page.

27
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.940
Does it.

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.720
Okay.

29
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.300
Now we are also going to pass the product IDs.

30
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.940
What we can do since we don't have it, we can then created the value.

31
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.960
Then I say, fine, it's going to be a type of string and products.

32
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.560
I'd.

33
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.870
Okay.

34
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.280
For the I.D. so we can then see arguments.

35
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.140
I think you've seen this before, right?

36
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.700
It says that we products.

37
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.860
And so I think we also need to pass it on to the constructor.

38
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.350
So alight and use contracted out.

39
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.960
Then go for the create constructor for final fields.

40
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.900
And you can then make it required.

41
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.760
Okay.

42
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.810
Alright.

43
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.120
Yeah.

44
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.370
I think we need this.

45
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.130
Okay.

46
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.380
Great.

47
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.310
And I use contra and necessary this way.

48
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260
There are going to be having some errors because we made this required.

49
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.580
Right.

50
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.200
Now, let's add up to the key.

51
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.710
You can see.

52
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.630
It was that field.

53
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.730
Okay, so there's going to be products ID and it's going to be on the scorecards provider that gets

54
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.550
carts item that values COVAXIN.

55
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.300
It's a list.

56
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.540
Then.

57
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.600
This is going to be intense.

58
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.010
Right.

59
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.380
Okay.

60
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.650
I think.

61
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.870
He's going to be sorry.

62
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.970
That's Keys just to get rid of this.

63
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.150
That's keys.

64
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.550
Okay, that's two lists.

65
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.710
And then Indians.

66
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.730
Okay, great.

67
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.990
There is culture.

68
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.860
And that's to save.

69
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.390
And then.

70
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.570
Click on this.

71
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.260
Okay.

72
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.890
Great.

73
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.110
Now the next thing we're going to do is when a user clicks on this pulse icon, we are going to be able

74
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.930
to increment the counts.

75
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.270
Okay.

76
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.570
Not to do this, we're going to go back to the cards, items, screen cards, item.

77
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.290
Okay.

78
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.460
And they're going to look for the plus icon, right?

79
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.700
Okay.

80
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.930
Okay.

81
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.470
Okay.

82
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.860
Okay.

83
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.620
Digital via.

84
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.950
So what we're going to do is we're going to call that COTS provider.

85
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.040
Think about it.

86
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.400
Okay.

87
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.050
Okay.

88
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.490
We need to party, right?

89
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.880
Okay.

90
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.390
You're going to have access to this.

91
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.850
We already created it already.

92
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.000
We're going to need to have access to this at Scots right away.

93
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.860
We are simply saying if we have not added that item, then we just want to had it.

94
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.310
Okay.

95
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.680
You're going to see this fully again in in this lecture.

96
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.250
So, first of all, you're going to need to have access to this.

97
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.850
Lots of products and products of.

98
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.450
That's right.

99
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.720
Okay.

100
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.780
So I'm going to go back to the.

101
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.630
Cuts.

102
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.350
I can.

103
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.000
Cause I can just control.

104
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.540
So.

105
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.410
Is controlled by Dan Rather.

106
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.840
I want to say find out the scorecards for.

107
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.740
VIDA is going to provide a dearth of contests.

108
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.490
And it's going to be cards provider rights.

109
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.830
Okay.

110
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.490
Okay.

111
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.640
Now, over here.

112
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.110
Over here.

113
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.790
You're going to see all of this car.

114
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.920
So on the scorecards provider.

115
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.480
Dot.

116
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.590
Hard products.

117
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.970
So cuts.

118
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.960
Okay.

119
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.700
You can see it automatically past the product I.D. so now there's is going to be.

120
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.990
On the score card.

121
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.820

Okay.

127
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.710
I think we need a calmer.

128
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.320
It is going to be on his cards.

129
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.540
Attribute.

130
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.020

132
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.950
Okay.

133
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.180
And he's going to be on the scorecards.

134
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.450
Attribute.

135
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.830
Actually, but not immeasurable.

136
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.550
Okay.

137
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.110
Sorry.

138
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.140
In this.

139
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.010
Okay.

140
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.480
I think we need this.

141
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.320
Okay.

142
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.760
Now is contrary.

143
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.510
An excessive.

144
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.730
Okay.

145
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.060
Now.

146
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.010
Click on this.

147
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.470
Okay.

148
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.470
You can see.

149
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.350
Right.

150
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.760
Okay.

151
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.480
Is walking is simply called in the.

152
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.620
Is calling this over here.

153
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.990
Is calling the.

154
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.200
Elsa Potts.

155
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.560
Right.

156
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.580
Since we already have that project's cats already.

157
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.240
Right.

158
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.740
So.

159
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.950
So it is calling this product.

160
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.100
It is calling this metal.

161
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.970
That is if what's right, sis already have it in cards.

162
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.040
So I simply objects in it.

163
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.370
Right.

164
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.290
And although it is going to hide it if it has not been had that before.

165
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.360
So it is not really coming to the house, but.

166
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.920
Dear if what's right.

167
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.270
Okay.

168
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.550
You're going to see this whole year again in the next lecture.

169
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.700
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
