00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.250
Walker In this lecture, we're going to create the court, provide class.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.220
But before then, in the last lecture, we created this class called Cart Attributes.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.070
And in order for us to be able to add items to our cots, we passed in all these fields.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.750
That is the products ID, the product tie to.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.770
The products quantity, which is how many products we have in stock, the product price and the product's

7
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.479
immeasurable.

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.080
And in order for us to be able to fill two of these fields, we pass it on to the constructor and as

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.550
well made it required.

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.970
Okay.

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.980
Now, before we create the card provider class, what they're going to do first is we're going to change

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.650
the string to the D2 type of heads because there's going to be a number.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.310
Okay.

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.750
Now, over this provider class, we're going to create a new file and be able to call this high cards.

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.640
While the score provider date is six year old, which is dot dot.

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.870
Okay.

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.720
And now I can use control a B to make this white.

18
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.720
Now you're going to create a class, and that's what we can call this class cuts provider.

19
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.260
Okay.

20
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.600
Then we can see it with change.

21
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.720
Notifier.

22
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.270
Okay, great.

23
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.660
Now as well over this attributes because as we'll see with change.

24
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.150
Notifier.

25
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.660
This was simply listening for a change we are making to this model and as well to discards.

26
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.080
Okay.

27
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.680
We don't need to this culture be to make this way again.

28
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.220
Okay.

29
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.100
Now we can say my.

30
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.090
They're going to do some sort of similar like that products.

31
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.140
Okay.

32
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.010
They're going to see my is going to be a string.

33
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.400
Then coma and the cat.

34
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.039
Model which record cat attributes.

35
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.370
Okay.

36
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.160
We're going to create a variable to store this.

37
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.430
So you're going to see all the scorecards items.

38
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.510
Okay.

39
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.090
Equality is equal to.

40
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.750
This.

41
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.630
Okay, now we're going to leave this empty, this useless negativity.

42
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.670
One so hard item to their cost, right?

43
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.000
Okay.

44
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.970
And now we can add this and call the way.

45
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.510
Now the next thing we're going to do, we are going to read some discourse items just the same way we

46
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.870
did.

47
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.560
Okay.

48
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.360
Right.

49
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.710
Okay.

50
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.410
Or I'm going to be doing something a bit similar to this.

51
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.550
What is going to be different?

52
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.060
Okay.

53
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.300
So we're going to go back to the cuts, the school products.

54
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.220
So records on this call provider.

55
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.430
Okay.

56
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.890
In order to return this, they are going to create a method to return this items.

57
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.130
So it is costs what is called cost items.

58
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.580
Okay.

59
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.710
Now I'm going to say my.

60
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.060
And strange.

61
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.270
Although the Cards model with record cards attributes.

62
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.610
Right.

63
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.000
Okay.

64
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.690
Idea.

65
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.030
Trying to.

66
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.510
And you're going to notice it gets then gets cuts.

67
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.720
I tell.

68
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.500
Right.

69
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.490
Okay, then all we just have to say is Richard.

70
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.570
That's right.

71
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.620
You can now see on the score cards items.

72
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.790
Right now, what we can as well do.

73
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.900
A census is a map.

74
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.610
We can just do this.

75
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.230
You can just leave it that way.

76
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.440
What?

77
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.060
We can as well go like this.

78
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.530
And had wanted to.

79
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.320
Okay.

80
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.980
So he does.

81
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.370
Okay.

82
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.900
Right.

83
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.980
So this basically adds.

84
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.240
And now we have access to all the attributes over this card.

85
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.830
We'll do.

86
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.940
Right.

87
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.330
Okay.

88
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.220
Now I can use control and save this fire.

89
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.540
And control.

90
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.460
And safe to say, if you don't understand, if you don't understand, this is absolutely fine.

91
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.850
I believe when we start when you start saying this, they're going to understand everything.

92
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.310
Right.

93
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.950
And you can as well has me questions.

94
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.400
Okay.

95
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.490
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
