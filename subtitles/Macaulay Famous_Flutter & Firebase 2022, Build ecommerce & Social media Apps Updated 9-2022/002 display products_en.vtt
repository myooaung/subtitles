00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.530
Walker In the last lecture, we all agreed that they're going to be able to have access to our products,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.050
which in all the pages.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.100
So what they simply did was to create if I called products and a class, then we listed all our products

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.430
over and we all agreed.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.950
Right, that we would have access to this product, which in all the pages.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.870
And to be able to have access to all this products, what they did was to go to our they actually turned

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.970
over this material.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
Have we wrapped it with the.

10
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.650
Multi provider and those here, you can see we are calling the FedEx provider class.

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.030
Okay.

12
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.830
Now, in this lecture, what they're going to do is they're going to be able to display the products

13
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.580
over here.

14
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.150
Okay.

15
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.970
Now, to do this, they're going to need to go to the full screen.

16
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.420
Right?

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.980
Is it?

18
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.700
And then we can use control and B, to make this wide.

19
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.680
First of all, you're going to get rid of this says where they have it in the products.

20
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.650
So right off I get rid of this.

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.880
Okay.

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.280
Now to have access to that provider, fly over here.

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.440
They're going to have a finite variable and they're going to call this variable.

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.670
So that's.

25
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.510
Provider.

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.580
Then is going to be Steve Carell by the.

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.910
Okay.

28
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.210
I'm just going to click on this automatically import it and I will get rid of this.

29
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.690
Then going to say start of contest.

30
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.700
The circle on it over here.

31
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.020
They're going to give you the letter that written down they were going to pass in that four deaths,

32
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.930
I think we called it.

33
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.790
So that's right.

34
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.270
Okay.

35
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.580
Great.

36
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.210
Now, then this thing you're going to do is going to create a verbal code.

37
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.340
So that list.

38
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.930
Because there is no specified type.

39
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.030
There's going to be a list.

40
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.330
The type is going to be the product model.

41
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.460
We call it products.

42
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.290
Right.

43
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.560
Okay.

44
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.750
So we are obsessed with us, thinking of us as to others ID tie to size imagery and so on.

45
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.100
Okay.

46
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.600
And now we can.

47
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.210
This is equal to this for that's.

48
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.140
Provider, then everybody in the product.

49
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.780
So right across this wire.

50
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.830
We simply said all these products we want to be able to assess is assess in this.

51
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.870
They were called four ducks.

52
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.570
So what they're going to do is over a year.

53
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.950
But isn't this a.

54
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.170
That's for the.

55
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.650
Okay, great.

56
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.270
So now we have access to all this for the.

57
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.320
To others for the.

58
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.370
Going to go back.

59
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.150
Okay.

60
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.240
Now we can use control to make this right.

61
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.930
Okay.

62
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.420
Now, what you're going to say is we're going to get rid of this product since we don't let go of it.

63
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.310
Now, this is going to be products.

64
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.370
For that list, that length.

65
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.970
Okay.

66
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.670
For this.

67
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.830
I will see you get rid of this.

68
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.360
There's going to be products.

69
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.660
List.

70
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.480
Then we can assess each item buys into it.

71
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.910
Then it's going to be darts.

72
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.190
I'd.

73
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.880
Right.

74
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.240
Okay.

75
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.840
As well.

76
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.080
Get rid of this is going to be for adults.

77
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.740
This.

78
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.760
Then you dance.

79
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.340
Okay.

80
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.700
Great.

81
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.460
Okay.

82
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.400
The same tent for this as well.

83
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.740
So there's is going to be.

84
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.370
For God's.

85
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.790
But at least.

86
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.010
Right.

87
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.480
Okay.

88
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.990
So it's going to be for that list.

89
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.730
Okay, so it is it.

90
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.950
Now, if you don't see, understand is totally fine.

91
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.730
You can just try to message.

92
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.230
So if you don't understand it.

93
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.950
So I try to explain more individual to you.

94
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.400
Okay.

95
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.360
Now we can use this to save and check it out and nothing is going to change.

96
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.240
Signal of dissension.

97
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.790
Right.

98
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.770
We can use all the studies to make sure nothing is changed.

99
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.090
Right.

100
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.240
Signal over the same ten.

101
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.870
Stigler, we say, okay, but now we are.

102
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.950
We now have access to.

103
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.510
All our products look good.

104
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.050
Check it out.

105
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.160
Okay.

106
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.120
Now you can see.

107
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.020
We now have access to all the products.

108
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.190
We can even display the products anywhere we want, if only to search the cards, the upload and the

109
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.760
profile.

110
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.680
So in this lecture, what we're going to do is go to this very product in the home screen.

111
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.130
Okay.

112
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.950
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
