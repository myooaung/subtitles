00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.280
In this lecture, we're going to be able to navigate between screens.

4
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.670
Okay?

5
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.570
Not to do this over the screens directory.

6
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.270
We're going to create two screens.

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.660
Okay.

8
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.780
The first screen is going to be meeting.

9
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.850
On this car screen.

10
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.890
And then there's section, the darts.

11
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.030
Okay.

12
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.580
And now we can use this this widgets stiffness widget and as well.

13
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.530
We can call this meeting screen or you can just call your smart screen.

14
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.950
Okay.

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.480
That over a year we're going to need to alight and then use country and dot in order to impart the material

16
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.610
that that package.

17
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.600
Okay then it that to have access to loss of property we can just use the scaffold.

18
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.600
Right.

19
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.910
Forward.

20
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.560
And now we have access to property like Buddy.

21
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.200
And we can just use this entire widget to set out in this widgets of the ways in which is going to be

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.060
it test widgets.

23
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:05.530
Okay.

24
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.030
I think we knew this as well.

25
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.810
And.

26
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.040
Is just going to say.

27
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.370
This is just going to say meet.

28
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.390
And.

29
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.400
Okay, we can just sit with the screen for now.

30
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.810
Okay.

31
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880
Now he's controlling this to say okay as well.

32
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.790
We're going to need to create another.

33
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.370
On the screen.

34
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.200
Can you fly?

35
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.920
And you're going to call this is story.

36
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.240
And the score screen.

37
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.220
Dot, dot.

38
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.170
Okay as well.

39
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.520
Using this widget and this story.

40
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.800
This story.

41
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.830
Or is stories.

42
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.440
Right.

43
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.890
Okay.

44
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.410
In a way, a light and is culture.

45
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.010
And that's.

46
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.460
Okay.

47
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.410
What's the matter around the death package?

48
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.250
And that's assets to loss of property.

49
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.130
We can then use the scaffold scaffold and now we have access to a property like body.

50
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.910
And you can just go ahead and say it says widgets.

51
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.700
And there's going to be a story screen, right, or whatever you want to call it.

52
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.090
Okay.

53
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.740
Now, what we can then do is alights and use concerned dots around.

54
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.220
Wrap this with the.

55
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.650
Okay, you can see this is the way to do this.

56
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.040
Okay.

57
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.020
And the view.

58
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.080
We can then hide it.

59
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.280
Okay.

60
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.730
They know that we're able to navigate with pages.

61
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.860
What we can do is over the homescreen of.

62
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.590
Screen.

63
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.880
We can create a variable to store those two screens we have so that we can see find a and we can call

64
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.320
this pages.

65
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.950
We can as well specify the type that is a list.

66
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.660
Then over here we can also say this is a widget, right?

67
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.890
But most of the time we don't even need to specify the time.

68
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.490
Right.

69
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.110
So orders are referred to as widgets.

70
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.830
Right.

71
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.190
Okay.

72
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.710
So most of the time we don't really need to specify the type, so we can just go ahead and say pages

73
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.990
is going to be equal to list.

74
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.040
Okay, we're going to have this and.

75
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.030
And over here we can then call the meeting.

76
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.780
Mittens.

77
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.810
Quinn This is the first item in at least, and the second we can then call the history.

78
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.240
Is to screen a case controller necessary and.

79
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.110
Over a year.

80
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.990
Or via the scaffold as a property as well.

81
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.740
Not as body.

82
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.100
Right.

83
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.270
So what we can do is add the chain of command in order to get a very good format.

84
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.900
You can see the bottom navigation bar and.

85
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.570
Yeah, right.

86
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.390
So within the scaffold, you can even do it.

87
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.700
Over year you can spread out the body so it can be at the top while can be at the bottom, but must

88
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.080
be within the scaffold.

89
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.520
So what we can just do is we can get rid of this and this.

90
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.750
The bottom.

91
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.120
So we tend to scaffold the kids in here.

92
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.340
So that's why it's good to have the trigger command.

93
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.230
And that's the way it ends, right?

94
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.560
Okay.

95
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.150
So that we can have the body and the body is going to be.

96
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.360
The page.

97
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.410
Intense.

98
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.210
Right.

99
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.670
Sorry.

100
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.590
We need to call the pages.

101
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.620
Pages.

102
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.360
I think we called it pages.

103
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.850
And now we can then pass in the page indents.

104
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.000
Page.

105
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.190
Page Indians.

106
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.660
Okay.

107
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.620
This.

108
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.040
Okay.

109
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.050
Get rid of this.

110
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.300
And his country and SC became then.

111
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.680
How did you come out of that?

112
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.640
Okay.

113
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.600
Great.

114
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.110
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

115
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.920
Okay, now you can see for now it is at zero and it's going to be at the meeting screen.

116
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.680
You can see now click on this.

117
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.300
You can you can see.

118
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.740
Automatically is going out of date eats to something else.

119
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.630
Okay.

120
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.430
Zero.

121
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.390
Okay.

122
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.100
If we should set it as zero.

123
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.710
But this is going to be where the.

124
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.730
I think it's going to work that way.

125
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.200
Okay so we're is gonna see page.

126
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.780
Intense.

127
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.560
Okay.

128
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.740
It's not working that way because over here we are saying the starting point is the speech.

129
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.160
And then so you're not to change that, you have to change it away.

130
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.690
Right.

131
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.290
That is the current indents.

132
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.160
Okay.

133
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.480
So this is basically.

134
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.360
It's guys.

135
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.790
Okay.

136
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.840
Now, if you don't steal this time, you can't.

137
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.550
Then let me know.

138
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.120
Okay.

139
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.610
I'm fully active to support you.

140
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.840
Okay.

141
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.140
You can see now, you can hide for the rest.

142
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.340
If you click on this now, you're going to get to there you can see.

143
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.660
Okay.

144
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.150
Okay.

145
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.060
I'm just going to stop here.

146
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.650
So all you can do is you can add more screens if you if you want.

147
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.280
Okay.

148
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.690
Now, that's why I avoid that.

149
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.050
Here, you can just create for the contacts, and that's all just settings.

150
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.450
Okay.

151
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.390
Okay, guys.

152
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.350
See, in.

153
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.220
In this lecture.
