00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.730
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.950
Walker In this lecture, they're going to display the carts item data.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.160
But before then, what we can do is we can increase the font size of this to 24.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.370
And over here we can use a capital data and value.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.640
We can wrap it with the princesses.

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.790
Yes.

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.260
Gotcha.

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.260
And this is saved now.

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.500
And go check it out.

10
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.150
Okay, great.

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.030
Now we are going to display the carts item data.

12
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.330
Okay.

13
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.360
Not to do this, we're going to create a dynamic variable.

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
We're going to use control and B, to make this formula.

15
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.790
And then we're going to go to the cart item.

16
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.800
Okay.

17
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.400
The over year revenue creates some dynamic variable.

18
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.380
First of all, we can use contra and be.

19
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.900
Okay.

20
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.560
Their friends, whoever is going to be a final rebel is going to be the Heidi.

21
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.010
We can specify it is a type of string.

22
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.660
Okay.

23
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.370
Is second is going to be the.

24
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.630
The string.

25
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.720
Products ID.

26
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.780
Okay, fine.

27
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.020
I assume that is the product name, right?

28
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.850
Okay.

29
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.480
This is going to be true, right?

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.830
Okay.

31
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.050
Okay as well for the price.

32
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.700
But there's going to be double.

33
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.780
And.

34
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.930
There's going to be eight for the quantity.

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.260
Okay, fine.

36
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.570
That again is going to be strange for the Amish IRL.

37
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.610
Okay, great.

38
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.350
Now, the next thing we are going to do is to pass it on to the constructor.

39
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.740
Right.

40
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.620
Okay, now over here, a light.

41
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.210
And then use culture and arts.

42
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.360
Okay, Control.

43
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.190
Sorry.

44
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.389
Okay.

45
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.140
Then creates constructor for final feeds.

46
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.600
We can then make all this required.

47
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.640
Okay.

48
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.380
Required.

49
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.650
Okay.

50
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.340
Required.

51
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.170
Okay.

52
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.300
So they required.

53
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.410
Required.

54
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.110
Required.

55
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.610
Okay.

56
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.520
Required.

57
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.480
And required.

58
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.990
They are going to have some heroes because we made all this required and we are calling this cards item

59
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.950
in the cards screen.

60
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.710
Okay.

61
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.750
So we're going to need to pass the values to all this.

62
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.130
Can I just go to the cut screen where we can use control the.

63
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.030
And on this occasion now for the ID is going to be the order scorecards provider.

64
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.780
Let's get it in thoughts, values, or just as a value.

65
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.450
Then want to convert it to a list.

66
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.970
And we can see.

67
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.830
Intends to assess each one.

68
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.360
Each item.

69
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.480
Is going to be it.

70
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.060
Okay.

71
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.820
Now, for the product, it is going to be a bit different.

72
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.090
It is going to be this coconut cotton provider that gets cut out in those keys.

73
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.360
Then Dodge to list.

74
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.300
Then it's just going to be intense.

75
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.710
Okay.

76
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.500
We also need for the prize and the scorecards provide the.

77
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.490
That's.

78
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.550
That gets cut item duds values.

79
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.270
They are converting to.

80
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.710
Okay.

81
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.110
That's the list.

82
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.860
Okay.

83
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.900
And then dance.

84
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.910
And then does price.

85
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:23.000
As well for the image IRL, God provides the goods to attend to its values.

86
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.260
That's so at least.

87
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.440
Intense and measurable.

88
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.040
Try to as well.

89
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:49.560
The values that are least okay in dance and that's tied to.

90
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.350
Yes.

91
00:04:51.350 --> 00:05:00.440
And it was the quantity of illness cut right to the goods cut item that values that to the least.

92
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.280
Okay.

93
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.160
He dance and then that quantity.

94
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.400
Okay, now he's gonna try this to save.

95
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.130
Okay, now we're going to go back to the cards, item, screen, and you're going to use those variables.

96
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.890
Okay.

97
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.010
Nobody uses dynamic variables.

98
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.330
Okay.

99
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.430
Now for the.

100
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.110
Image.

101
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.300
You're going to get rid of this and use dollar sign us us as a rainbow.

102
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.270
Okay.

103
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.360
They're going to call the image URL.

104
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.750
Right.

105
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.040
Okay.

106
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.140
Okay as well.

107
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.760
Title.

108
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.530
Okay.

109
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.490
Price.

110
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.900
Right.

111
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.220
Okay.

112
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.520
Okay.

113
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.350
So we're not there.

114
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.080
Isn't that crazy?

115
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.330
Right?

116
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.020
Are your dollar sign?

117
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.590
Okay.

118
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.240
We can just mute that for now.

119
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.640
Okay.

120
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.200
For the quantity.

121
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.130
Okay.

122
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.680
Guess you know this is going to require.

123
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.140
Okay.

124
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.760
Dollar.

125
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.790
They can't to.

126
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.760
Corn, sweetie.

127
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.190
Okay, great.

128
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.760
Okay, now go check it out.

129
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.070
Okay.

130
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.550
Great.

131
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.940
They can.

132
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.330
It's.

133
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.290
Right.

134
00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.620
Okay.

135
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.540
We can.

136
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.520
You can see currently we have a list of this item again to see if it updates the cost quantity.

137
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.840
Okay.

138
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.760
Now.

139
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.740
We said if her idea of this, of course, we just want to update it.

140
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.140
Right.

141
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.460
Okay.

142
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.870
That's.

143
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.140
Okay.

144
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.310
You can see because to remember we had earlier said that if.

145
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.160
Okay.

146
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.760
Who said?

147
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.540
It cuts items that contains that is if it's already knockout, we use any product I.D. to check then

148
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:47.240
we want to of digits we want you can see else we don't want to had it if it if it has not been here

149
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.890
before.

150
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.370
Okay great.

151
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.000
Okay.

152
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.810
Sounds good.

153
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.070
Okay, guys.

154
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.120
Seen the Netflix show?
