Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.030
What we are going to be doing this lecture is when we click on my store, we are going to display the

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.890
current seller products.

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.690
Okay.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.480
Now to do this, you can see within the minus screens and then the visit store screen.

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.530
What we are simply doing is we are retrieving our products based on the seller.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.450
UID Right.

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:35.340
So what we can do is back to the dashboard screen instead of the seller store screen, we can get rid

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.880
of this and then cover the visit.

11
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.130
The visit store.

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.250
Screen.

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.870
Okay.

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.120
And you can see it's asking for the value of the seller uid.

15
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560
So this is going to be firebase.

16
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.570
Firebase.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.400
Courts in order to get the clearance seller uid file be sought.

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:14.300
DOT is stance towards current user and then dot you Heidi and over here we can had a no check and had

19
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.740
a comma and now we have to restart this.

20
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.160
It's going to take some time to restart and then we have to reload in.

21
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.160
Okay.

22
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.600
Almost done.

23
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.470
We just have to wait for this a bit and hopefully you understand all this.

24
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.950
But if we don't, you can do also let me know and I'm fully available to answer all your questions.

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.560
Okay.

26
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.260
It's going to hard to start this and.

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.060
It's going to log in to Famous.

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.110
Store.

29
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.360
G.M. dot com.

30
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.480
And the password is be g-a-y.

31
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.360
A log in.

32
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.789
Okay.

33
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.000
And now dashboard.

34
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.890
In my store.

35
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.690
And you can see just what products are being displayed.

36
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.350
Sounds good, right?

37
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.410
You can see all those products are owned by.

By me.

39
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.170
You can see walking as expected.

40
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.270
Okay.

41
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.670
