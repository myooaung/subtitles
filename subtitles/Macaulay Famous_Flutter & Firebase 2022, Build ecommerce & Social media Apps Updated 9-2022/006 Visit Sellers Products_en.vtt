00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.940
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.960
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.290
Now, what we're going to be doing this lecture is when we click on this icon over here, we want to

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.320
go to the store where that product was uploaded.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.010
Okay.

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.040
Not to do this, we have to head back to the detail folder.

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.060
And then the products on the score detail.

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.380
Fi and what we can then do is to use control and be some x y OC.

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.260
And.

10
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.260
And over here you can see we have the icon, right?

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.640
And over here we can then say navigator.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.030
Dot push.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.190
We want to push to a new screen.

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.530
And for the roots or roots.

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
This is not Syria material.

16
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.640
Paige Rhodes and the builder will always take in the contest.

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.630
And how do you semi-colon the wire?

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.470
And now we can return the visit.

19
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.090
The visit store screen.

20
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.440
Now we have to pass the value to the seller.

21
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.610
Your ID right.

22
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.490
And the uid.

23
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.490
And I think we have.

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.270
Okay.

25
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.930
Where do we have that?

26
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.480
Okay.

27
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.430
Okay.

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.600
We have to assess that product list.

29
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.260
Okay.

30
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.390
This is going to be a product.

31
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.920
Product lists.

32
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.130
And this is going to be what, seller?

33
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.480
You did.

34
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.640
Okay.

35
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.960
This is basically it.

36
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.380
Is control and save.

37
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.380
And hopefully you understand why.

38
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.300
If you don't, please do well to let me know.

39
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.880
And I think you understand well, most of the time you have forgotten what we did previously.

40
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.800
And you might get confused the reason why we are doing something like this.

41
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.310
Look.

42
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.390
Now click on this.

43
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.240
Okay.

44
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.300
I think we need to start again.

45
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.550
Okay.

46
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.930
We need an auto start.

47
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.940
Also, we start this.

48
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.790
Okay.

49
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.440
Hopefully it won't take.

50
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.590
Any time.

51
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.840
Okay.

52
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.950
And if you have successfully started, you can just go ahead and try that out yourself.

53
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.600
And is definitely going to take you to that store where the product was uploaded.

54
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.800
Look, I don't think I would wait for this.

55
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.510
Maybe you just have to try this out yourself or I'm just going to wait for maybe 2 seconds.

56
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.500
Okay.

57
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.790
Ready?

58
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.450
Okay.

59
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.080
Done.

60
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.160
Okay.

61
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.090
Sorry for the delay.

62
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.840
I think I have a very slow PC and hopefully I get a new one.

63
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.310
Okay.

64
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.660
And this.

65
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.930
Okay.

66
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.320
We.

67
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.250
Still on this.

68
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.660
Okay.

69
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.620
Okay.

70
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.450
Sorry.

71
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.270
Do you remember this call?

72
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.500
The mood is calm.

73
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.810
We are messy.

74
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.550
Get rid of this distraction.

75
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.600
Okay.

76
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.650
We must do all that.

77
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.170
Come.

78
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.290
And now we can click on this and then click on this.

79
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.730
Not.

80
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.150
Oh, I think we did that for the wrong.

81
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.040
The wrong button.

82
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.690
Okay, get rid of it.

83
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.380
Sorry.

84
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.330
Dance of.

85
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.170
Get rid of this and piz this.

86
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.550
No wonder we have to twist that, because really, we did not create any new screen and get rid of this

87
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.930
and use control and save.

88
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.860
Okay.

89
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.090
You can see a.

90
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.900
And back to this.

91
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.980
Now click on this.

92
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.290
Okay.

93
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.650
It took us to the store.

94
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.790
We had the product was uploaded and this is no longer active.

95
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.690
Okay.

96
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.670
Click on this.

97
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:54.390
We have the protocols that I think currently we have just one store for all this product and everything

98
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.830
should work as expected.

99
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.490
Okay.

100
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.650
Okay, guys, say you.
