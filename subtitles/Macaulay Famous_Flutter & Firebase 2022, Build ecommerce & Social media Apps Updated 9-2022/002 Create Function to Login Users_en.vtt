00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.290
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.420
Now, in this lecture, we're going to create the optionality to log and use us.

4
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.820
Okay?

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.410
The recording as well.

6
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.090
We're going to clear the Pict image.

7
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.280
So to do that over here as well, we're going to use the global variable we created.

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.240
The global variable is a variable which is ordered the.

9
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.680
Pics image rights.

10
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.290
Okay.

11
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.640
Now, what they're going to do is they're going to clear the picture image as well.

12
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.220
So to do that, we just have to do is I'm going to go back to.

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.880
The Register function.

14
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.860
Okay.

15
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.500
Like it digital right now you're going to call that variable which record on this call image.

16
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.930
Right.

17
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.150
They were going to set darts, clay.

18
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.510
Okay.

19
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.050
Easy as that, then.

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.070
That's all I want to add.

21
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.990
Our exclamation mark.

22
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.300
Then hide your semicolon.

23
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.860
Okay, great.

24
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.780
It designates control and has to save this.

25
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.680
Then I'm going to navigate to the login page.

26
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.610
Okay.

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.350
Now, like I said, we are going to create the functionality to log in users.

28
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.680
Okay.

29
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.150
Not to do this.

30
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.430
They're going to do this and the arts comptroller as well.

31
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.240
Okay.

32
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.300
Now I'm going to use culture and B, to make this wider.

33
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.350
Okay.

34
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.640
Now, this is.

35
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.810
The class which has scored all its controller.

36
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.610
And this is the.

37
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
Function to this is a function to sign of users.

38
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.380
Okay.

39
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.780
Now we're going to create a function to.

40
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.910
Log in users.

41
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.200
Okay, so this function is here.

42
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.880
Right.

43
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.280
Okay.

44
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.900
So now we're going to create another function to log in users.

45
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.160
So it's going to look similar like this.

46
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.570
Okay.

47
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.780
So we're very, very happy we're going to be doing this again so you can start the process.

48
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.590
Okay.

49
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.030
First of all, we can add the comments and the function.

50
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730
To log any users.

51
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.020
Okay, great.

52
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.070
They're going to create a function that they can call this.

53
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.950
Log.

54
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.800
Log in.

55
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.090
Okay.

56
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.020
Log in.

57
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.730
Is this okay?

58
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.830
Now the first thing they're going to do is to pass the required fields.

59
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.240
Now we just have two fields.

60
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.360
That is the email, the password.

61
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.720
Right?

62
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.790
So having the pass and the email, it is a test.

63
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.180
So it's going to be a type of string.

64
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.250
Okay.

65
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.080
And also in the the password, which is also a test, so is a type of word string.

66
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.040
Okay.

67
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.960
Now we're going to pass the async.

68
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.530
Here.

69
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.140
Okay.

70
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.030
Now.

71
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.590
First of all, I used to try and catch them not to get access to the car as I used to go down to this.

72
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.010
Okay.

73
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.890
They can see we have to try and catch.

74
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.400
Okay.

75
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.710
Now, first of all, you're going to have some validation check just like this.

76
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.220
Like I said, they're basically going to go with the same intent.

77
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.130
Almost all you can see it's a similar.

78
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.140
Okay.

79
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.210
So now you're going to use an E you've it word to check or to give some validation check.

80
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.740
So you're going to see an email that is not empty and.

81
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.150
Password.

82
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.410
God is not empty.

83
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.880
Okay.

84
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.030
Dead only.

85
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.170
We want to do something available before then.

86
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.610
What we can do is.

87
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.120
We can.

88
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.430
Create a verb for possible error as well.

89
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.530
I'm going to call this race.

90
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.500
I'm going to say it equates to some error or cart.

91
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.850
Okay.

92
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.950
Now, this is a test, right?

93
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.520
So it is a type of string.

94
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.140
Okay.

95
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.630
Great.

96
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.100
Okay.

97
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:24.050
So now if those skills are not empty, then what they're going to do is they're going to call the families

98
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.250
or two, which we have defined.

99
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.870
And the cost in the calls that that's why they're going to say firebase.

100
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.510
Firebase Odds.

101
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.510
Then there's going to be dot sign.

102
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.210
Sign.

103
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.100
I get it.

104
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.270
But it's outside for us.

105
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.330
There's going to be sign in with email and password.

106
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.870
Okay.

107
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.780
There you can see to us the email and the password.

108
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.630
Okay.

109
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.130
Great.

110
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.390
Now this is basically it.

111
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.440
What you can do is we can with this as a.

112
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.030
Okay.

113
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:15.050
Then for the catch we can say is that to this we want to update the variable to rest it.

114
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.410
So he's going to be e starts to string.

115
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.550
Eat or just drink.

116
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.720
Okay.

117
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.450
Now, over here as well.

118
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.730
If this goes unattended to, then only want to create the.

119
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.810
Yes.

120
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.560
Sorry.

121
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.340
Then only we want to send in the user with email and password.

122
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.640
Right.

123
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.120
Okay.

124
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.350
So as well we kind of did the rest variable to.

125
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.360
See.

126
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.230
Sources.

127
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.220
Okay.

128
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.260
And also we can trace.

129
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.900
You now logged in to the console show.

130
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.430
Okay, great.

131
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.980
Now, lastly, after this, we're just going to say on.

132
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.110
Race.

133
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.550
Okay.

134
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.090
Great.

135
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.930
Now you can see.

136
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.590
Easy as that.

137
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.180
Right.

138
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.470
So it's a similar like this, as you can see.

139
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.800
Okay.

140
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.500
So this has got to ease to this, basically what we need to lock in users.

141
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.900
First of all, we.

142
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.940
We created the function called log in users.

143
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.350
Then we said The two fields we're going to be using to log in that user is just email and just the password

144
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.660
that over you we created.

145
00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.700
If we recall the address and we assign the possible heroes to it, then we are using to try the cache

146
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.900
block of other try block.

147
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:13.020
What you are simply saying is if the email is not empty, that if the user fills in those fields, if

148
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.260
these are fields in the email and the password, then only we want to log in the user.

149
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.470
Then we have to know that the variable from which we call address we have a log did that to be able

150
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.680
to assess that as a benefit.

151
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:37.260
So the console you have now logged in, okay, now this is the if we can also have and house statements.

152
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.720
Okay, so we did the Restrepo then we can just.

153
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.370
Fields.

154
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.740
If it holds, I think you're just going to spy from the other spelling.

155
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.700
Care.

156
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.670
Okay, I think we said please.

157
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.190
We just have to plead with the user.

158
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.410
Please feels.

159
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:09.490
Must not be an empty tea.

160
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.470
Okay.

161
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.190
Great.

162
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.900
So we are saying if all the skills are not valid, if all fields are valid, that we want to create

163
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.440
the user with the sorry.

164
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.460
We don't want to create the user to create the user, but we want to sign in the user with the email

165
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.470
password.

166
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:37.440
Else if the users refuses to if the users refuses to fill in those fields, then we want to say please,

167
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.120
fields must not be was empty.

168
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:50.250
Then if there is other heroes that does not has to do with this, we just want to catch that error.

169
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.510
Right?

170
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.080
Okay.

171
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.730
We just watched across the area, the area where it's on to the rest.

172
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.420
Okay.

173
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.940
Now, your assessment is going to be this.

174
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:08.500
You're going to try to implement this function is going to look exactly like the sign up.

175
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:09.950
Okay.

176
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.400
Before then, I'm going to give you something that's useful.

177
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.550
Not to grab the opinions of the user first.

178
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.490
They're going to grab you're going to use it just that it's a controller, which you have seen before

179
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.130
in the sign off.

180
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.170
You can as well just go back to that side.

181
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.910
Obviously, I want to do this to try to do this yourself.

182
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.130
Okay.

183
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:32.700
So you are going to get the sense you're going to get to to get the value of the iPad.

184
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.660
That is the value of this.

185
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.500
Both inputs you need to use what it is that the controller did.

186
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.880
You're going to bind it to the fields.

187
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:47.650
That is the email field and the password field, then over the log in section.

188
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.110
I think this is not the log in over the log in section.

189
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.220
Okay.

190
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.400
You're going to create a sequel trilogy, right?

191
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:57.900
Okay.

192
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.020
So.

193
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.200
What about the log in section?

194
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.660
You're going to create a variable.

195
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.060
So another variable but a function.

196
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:13.020
First of all, you're going to rob this this widgets with a gesture detector observatory that we did

197
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.620
with the gas detector.

198
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:21.790
Now, remember, I said, in order for you to have access to that log in users, you need to first call

199
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.500
the odd controller.

200
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.020
So you need to see odd controller.

201
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.710
For instance, it starts.

202
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:36.290
Log in users pass those tests that it's a cultural body that is the variable you can call it probably

203
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.860
email or discord email controller or discord password controller.

204
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.110
Okay.

205
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.970
So that is a school for you.

206
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.930
So you can try to do this yourself then.

207
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.400
And in this lecture we are going to do it together.

208
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:49.940
Okay?

209
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.700
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
