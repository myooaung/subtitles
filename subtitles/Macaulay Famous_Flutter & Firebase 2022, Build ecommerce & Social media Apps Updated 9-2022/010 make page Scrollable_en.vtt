Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.990
Now, if you click on this image, just shoot.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.510
I'm going to get this overflow error.

5
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.950
And in order to get rid of this earth layer or what we can do is we can make this side of page scrollable.

6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.940
Okay.

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.710
So now to do this, I'm going to go to this code now over this column bubble, wrap it with a single

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.090
child, scroll view.

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.380
So by doing that, it's going to make this side of page scrollable.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.370
Okay.

11
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.420
So now over this column, I'm going to use Control.

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.100
I don't.

13
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.560
Rap.

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.290
What we did then is going to be single charged.

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.980
Of you.

16
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.340
So by doing this, our of pages are scrollable.

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.080
Okay.

18
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.390
Is coach unnecessary?

19
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.010
Okay.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.290
Okay.

21
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.710
Good.

22
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.370
Now, that's crude vertically so that you can see we can scroll vertically, right?

23
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.870
Okay, great.

24
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.520
Now what you can do, we can take this back to where it was before.

25
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.690
So over this container, they're going to see alignment.

26
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.270
So there's going to be alignment.

27
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.250
That sits right center.

28
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.600
So who's going to take it back to the way it was before?

29
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.070
That is the center.

30
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.630
Okay, great.

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.270
Now, you can see as the keyboard pops out is going to go to the heart.

32
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.840
And that was the reason we were out with this in which I scrub you, scroll view, able to scroll the

33
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.670
sign up page.

34
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.020
Okay, great.

35
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.970
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
