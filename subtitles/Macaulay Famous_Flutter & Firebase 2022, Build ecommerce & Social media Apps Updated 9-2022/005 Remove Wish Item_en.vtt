00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.450
In this lecture, we are going to be able to remove each item from our wish list.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.230
To do this, first of all, what we can do is we can create the design for this.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.270
So we have to go to the wish list screen.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.560
And used to be.

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.780
And you can see over here we have the container, right?

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.530
So we turn the container.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.410
We can just have a row and that's zero.

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.300
We first need to say child and the child is going to be a Rojas.

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.460
And it can take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed horizontally.

12
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.900
Right.

13
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.430
Okay.

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.920
And this is going to be icon icon button.

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.830
And it is a function.

16
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.650
Okay.

17
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:07.510
And this is going to be an icon widget and we can just use the font, awesome icon font, awesome icons.

18
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.960
Then we have an icon known as delete delete left.

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.710
I had a change of command, had the command and is control and that's the save.

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.790
And you should see it over over here.

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.150
And what we can also do is we can change the colour of the icons and maybe colors the sign.

22
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350
Okay, great.

23
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.380
And now we have to create the functionality to do this.

24
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.290
We have to go to the provider directory and then the wish list provider.

25
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.760
Okay.

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.310
And over here we have to create a function and we just have to say void and we're going to call this

27
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
function remove which item?

28
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.180
And within the parenthesis, we have to pass the product class, product, class and product, which

29
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.120
is basically referring to the products we want to remove.

30
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.410
And all we just have to say is to call the underscore.

31
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.220
Least then doth.

32
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.650
We remove, remove and we want to remove the products.

33
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.090
Okay, great.

34
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.090
And lastly, we have to then cover the notify list in order to listen for the changes.

35
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.540
Okay.

36
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.390
Use control and save.

37
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.370
And now back to.

38
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.110
The.

39
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.530
The wish lists screen.

40
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.920
Okay.

41
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.520
We turned this function.

42
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.830
It is impossible to use the contest to watch.

43
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.020
And it is also impossible to use the provider of context without passing the list name.

44
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.990
And I'm going to show you this.

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.470
Use the context that watch.

46
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.950
Contests that watch.

47
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.560
And we have to specify the data we want to assess.

48
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.310
We want to assess the wish of this provider data.

49
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
And this is going to be the remove item.

50
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.210
And we want to remove the item by the index.

51
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.410
So this is going to be which provider I think we have available at that.

52
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.640
Which provider?

53
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.380
Then the word gets which items, it gets which items, and we want to assess it by the index.

54
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.780
OC country needs and SSA.

55
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.890
And.

56
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.190
Click on it.

57
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.410
You can see it is not removing.

58
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.290
And let's go check our terminal to see what's going on there.

59
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:57.190
Look, you can see we have this error and it's trying to say we cannot watch data from the function.

60
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.010
We can only read data.

61
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.960
So the solution for this is that we use the context that read or use the provider of context, and we

62
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.490
have to then pass the list main and say it's going to be equal to false and let's make it a readable

63
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.839
file or readable.

64
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.019
So instead of this, we can use the context.

65
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.160
Contest.

66
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.390
Dirt read.

67
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:37.400
We want to be able to use the wish provider and this is going to be that what that remove item and which

68
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.390
provider.

69
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.140
Writer and.

70
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.380
So he did get items and we won't basically assess each of them by their index.

71
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.240
Okay.

72
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.280
And this is going to work since we sent contest that read and that is what is basically expected.

73
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.000
And the reason for this is because we are within a function.

74
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.620
So we cannot use the contest watch within a function.

75
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.860
We cannot click on this some skill.

76
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.570
And also instead of this, we could also use the older type, which is very similar to this, and that

77
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.130
is the provider.

78
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.090
Provider that of context.

79
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.250
And we also have to specify the data we want to assess with the provider.

80
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.890
And this is going to be that remove which item.

81
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:42.080
And we are going to remove the item by the index, which provider that gets items then index.

82
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.730
And now we currently.

83
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.630
This is.

84
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.820
This is equivalent to the contest watch.

85
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.970
Right, because default, I think, is going to set it to true.

86
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.010
So what we can then do is we can either drink cover and we have to then at least tend to force.

87
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.050
So this is same as the contest, the treat.

88
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.950
Okay.

89
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.550
And now click on this.

90
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.380
Okay.

91
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.640
Cisco.

92
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.180
So you can basically use any of your choice.

93
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.010
Okay.

94
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.270
Okay, guys.

95
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.630
See you in the next lecture.
