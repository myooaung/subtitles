Hi, Walker.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.810
Now, when use clicks on any of these projects, we then want to take that user to the digital page

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.189
of that project's okay.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.770
Now, since Y is in, provider is going to be a bit complex, but I'm going to try my best to explain

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.260
that code to you.

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.630
Okay.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.410
Now, to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VR record.

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640
Then we're going to go to the product provider class.

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.220
Okay.

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.070
Okay.

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.190
And now I will lose control a B to make this white.

12
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.850
Now, what they're going to do now is we are going to create a method or a function to get the product

13
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.120
ID.

14
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.350
Okay.

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.110
So to do that, we're just going to specify the type that is the type of product that is the product

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.980
model.

17
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.410
Okay.

18
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.750
Now we're going to create a function and we can call this find by.

19
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.100
I'd.

20
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.140
Okay.

21
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.680
Great.

22
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.750
Now the next thing you are going to do is rolling across the river by air.

23
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.940
So any time we call this fight, by the way, I then go to positive value.

24
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.290
Okay.

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.900
The river is going to be a type of strength and it's going to be the products it.

26
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.220
Okay.

27
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.720
Great.

28
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.190
Now, the nesting regular need to do is to return.

29
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.430
Return this variable.

30
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.770
That has access to all this data that is is variable.

31
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.390
The other is called products.

32
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.830
Okay.

33
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600
So you can see return on this car products.

34
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.110
Then we're going to say dots.

35
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.820
First.

36
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.450
We're.

37
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.860
We had elements.

38
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.470
Elements that I'd.

39
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.630
Is equal to.

40
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.400
The products.

41
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.500
The products ID.

42
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.520
Okay.

43
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.840
Great.

44
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.540
So this is basically it.

45
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.210
Now, one user clicks on this.

46
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.290
So we're going to take the user to that.

47
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.900
Product is whether it's illegal to take the user to that product's right and not other products.

48
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.250
It is what we're basically saying.

49
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.700
Then the next lecture, we are going to call this function.

50
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.810
We have a via function method.

51
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.670
And when we call this function.

52
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.600
Then are going to pass the value to.

53
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.140
But this is just a variable.

54
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.120
Right.

55
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.360
So you are going to pass the value to this and it's going to be the product ID able to pass.

56
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.040
You just going to see this in this lecture.

57
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.940
Okay.

58
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.840
So what you are going to need to do now is to probably have the chain of command via you, not to have

59
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.890
a very good and very nice format.

60
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.190
And in essence, do is to use control and this.

61
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.120
Okay.

62
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.270
So any mistake you are going to continue from here?

63
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.190
Okay, guys, see you.
