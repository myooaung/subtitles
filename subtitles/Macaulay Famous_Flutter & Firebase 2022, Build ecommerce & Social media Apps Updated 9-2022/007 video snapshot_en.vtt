00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.440
In this lecture, we're going to create the instructions of how a video is going to be stored in our

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.039
database.

5
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.560
Okay, now, to do this, we're going to do this within the video class.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.040
Right.

7
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.390
Okay.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.770
So over here.

9
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.420
We're going to need to say static.

10
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.650
And we are going to need to call that class court video and we can say from.

11
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.930
From Snap.

12
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.000
And each video is referred to as what?

13
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.970
A document.

14
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.200
So we can say document snapshots.

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.800
And so this is the variable called SNAP.

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.230
And this is a type of document snapshot.

17
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.400
Okay.

18
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.870
And now we can then create a variable again and say by.

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.540
Snap.

20
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.370
Snap shot.

21
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.680
It's going to be equal to describe a cold snap.

22
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.930
Then dots.

23
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.760
Data.

24
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.800
Right.

25
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.260
Okay.

26
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.170
And now we can then see this.

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.210
Map.

28
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.380
I think you've seen this before.

29
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.400
Map.

30
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.270
String and die.

31
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.740
Nah, make.

32
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.840
Okay, great.

33
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.860
Okay.

34
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.650
Great.

35
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.760
And now we can return the video model.

36
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.440
Okay, return.

37
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.080
The video.

38
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.100
I think the video.

39
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.230
Okay, great.

40
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.190
Okay.

41
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.260
Now for the user name, I will just have to say is snapshot.

42
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.020
You can see this is a variable now holds in this race snapshots does what starts.

43
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.560
Okay.

44
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.670
So snapshot.

45
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.700
And we can then say username.

46
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.530
Make sure you don't have any spelling mistake.

47
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.470
And as well.

48
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.190
Snap.

49
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.840
Shot a snapshot.

50
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.220
And this is going to be what you ID.

51
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.009
Okay.

52
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.760
Sorry.

53
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.140
You already.

54
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.470
And.

55
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.860
Snap.

56
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.130
Snapshot.

57
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.750
Snapshot, snapshot.

58
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.260
And this is going to be wide eyed.

59
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.700
And we can just bring this to the next nine and.

60
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.510
As well.

61
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.600
Make this list line and this line and this line and this line.

62
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.430
This line as well.

63
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.220
And lastly, this line.

64
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.880
Okay.

65
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.730
Okay.

66
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.740
Okay.

67
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.190
We can just continue from here.

68
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.420
When we use control and our save is automatically formatted for us.

69
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.470
Okay.

70
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.400
This is going to be likes.

71
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.770
Now, our mistake we did is this is going to be a list of likes.

72
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.820
So we need to say at least.

73
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.300
Right, because one video can have many legs.

74
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.950
List.

75
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.910
Okay.

76
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.960
Okay.

77
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.400
Okay.

78
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.320
Okay.

79
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.490
And this.

80
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.070
This.

81
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.550
Okay, over here as well.

82
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.380
We need to say snap.

83
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.410
So it's now shut.

84
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.270
And comment.

85
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.490
You can just copy this to make sure you don't have any spelling mistake.

86
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.140
Okay.

87
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.180
It is big this in this line and.

88
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.660
He's going to be snapped.

89
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.930
Shut.

90
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.840
Okay.

91
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.890
Sure.

92
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.700
Sorry.

93
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.470
Share counts.

94
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.570
Snap shot.

95
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.220
And song name.

96
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.080
Okay.

97
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.000
Snap shut.

98
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.550
So culture and.

99
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.390
Snap.

100
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.370
Shut.

101
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.570
Video URL.

102
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.580
Had your words.

103
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.010
The R, l and y as well.

104
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.320
Okay.

105
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.250
There's going to be a snap shot.

106
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.590
Okay.

107
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.730
There's going to be some.

108
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.560
No.

109
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.900
And lastly, lastly.

110
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.030
It's going to be a snapshot.

111
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.520
I think there's a lot of work just to make our code clean and more readable.

112
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.120
We have to pass through all this profi.

113
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.330
Profile photo.

114
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.120
Now, all this could have been avoided.

115
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.890
Right now, instead of doing all this passage through all this process, that is still our our view.

116
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.470
I think you can do that.

117
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.110
I would just have to say it is what's.

118
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.420
Firebase.

119
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.360
So faster and collection.

120
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.570
That collection and.

121
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.830
Call the coalition video and it's dark and you can see you can just open some and it sets.

122
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.920
And this.

123
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.040
The fourth is, you know, not all the data were fed to snapshot.

124
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.430
Right.

125
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.870
So it's going to know all that.

126
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:54.890
So we really don't need to pass through all this huge process, but we're just trying to follow the

127
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.260
MVC pattern.

128
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.380
So that's why we have to go through all this long process.

129
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:10.070
So currently we are trying to follow the re process and doing it rather than just doing the same Firebase

130
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.230
Collection videos.

131
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.780
So we are simply creating the structures of how the video is going to be uploaded.

132
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.840
So this is going to be uploaded in our database, the user name and the user name of the user, the

133
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.480
user ID and so on.

134
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.120
Exactly.

135
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.920
This pattern is what is going to take in.

136
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.480
That's upload that, upload each video.

137
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.080
Okay.

138
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.940
Now, like I told you, we can basically avoid all this, right, by following this.

139
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.490
My takeaway and you can use my type user and these are name and sort.

140
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:53.830
You can see over here we have the user doc in the that's a get the user I think over here.

141
00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.090
Okay you can see we I get to the user so the odd or those can actually be avoided.

142
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.390
Okay.

143
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.580
But since we are following the visit, but then we have to do all this, right.

144
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.650
So this is basically everything we need for the modules.

145
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.080
Okay.

146
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.840
Okay, guys, see you in a nice lecture.
