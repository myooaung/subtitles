00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.400
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.700
Now, what we were going to do in this lecture is over here.

4
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.400
We're going to have the pro fly icon.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.620
And over here, we're going to have the four rights icon and the comments icon and the share icon.

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.070
Okay.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.520
Now, to do this, rather than need to go back to VSC court.

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.600
Okay.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.680
They can see over here we have a real widget and we're basically wrapping it with an expanded widgets

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.680
widget.

11
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.700
So you take what's the available space and the value.

12
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.590
We have a column widget.

13
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.660
Now that's a wrap the rest widget.

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.840
And that's a display tab vertically.

15
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.830
Right.

16
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.440
And the value we have in this stack are the reason for the stack is we want all this widgets on top

17
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.310
of the video player widget.

18
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.770
Okay.

19
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.020
Okay.

20
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
So now what are going to need to do in this lecture is over here.

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.630
We're going to have some icons over here.

22
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.230
And you can see we basically have the root.

23
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.620
Right.

24
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.410
Okay.

25
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.980
And the first the first side of the role is what's a column widget?

26
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.670
Now, we can basically just get rid of this container since it really does nothing.

27
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.020
So you can highlight.

28
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
A light and use controlled dots removed this widgets.

29
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.600
Okay, control.

30
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.260
Now save.

31
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.920
You can see it's not going to have any effect on this.

32
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.270
Okay.

33
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.070
Okay.

34
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.580
Now, over this row, we have a column write a column widget which is going to display and thus we just

35
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.390
we're going to be using vertically.

36
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.310
You can see this is a name and the caps are both displayed vertically.

37
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.990
So what we can do is we can rob this pardon with an expanded widget so it as well.

38
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.200
So this is a name that captures will take the available space is pounded.

39
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.800
Okay.

40
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.130
Now, is control necessary?

41
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.850
Okay.

42
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.770
And now we can then have the rest of the widgets allow you to do this.

43
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.360
We need to come out from this expanded widget, right?

44
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.840
Okay.

45
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.190
So this is it over here.

46
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.130
We're going to need to add the a comma.

47
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.450
And the reason we are coming out is because this is basically we can just see this as the main first,

48
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.780
which acts as a means for us, which is of.

49
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.810
This role.

50
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.150
Okay.

51
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.270
Everything over here.

52
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.300
As the May 1st we get out of this row.

53
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.630
Okay.

54
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.450
So we're going to need to come out from this expanded widget in the that's a this video the widgets

55
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.230
over here.

56
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.700
Okay.

57
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.840
You're going to see this me?

58
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.010
And you're going to have a container widget.

59
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.850
A container.

60
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.030
And the reason for this container is so we have access to properties like weeds and we're going to say

61
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.840
on red percent.

62
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.840
And Margie, we're going to give you a margin to this.

63
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.100
And this is going to be hedge.

64
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.050
Hedge.

65
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.610
It said that Hall of Sighs.

66
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.740
We so we can just see that that's holy.

67
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.340
What do you want to give for the top quality?

68
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.090
It's what we can do.

69
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.030
We can get the screen of us off of our hub by saying medical evidence of.

70
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.960
Contests that called contest.

71
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.820
The size, the height, and we want to divide the screen up that gets in the screen.

72
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.880
We want two divided by five.

73
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.060
He is controlling this to save.

74
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.050
Okay.

75
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.510
And like I told you, we're going to be having this widgets over year.

76
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.880
Right.

77
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.700
And that with my discussion is going to be displayed wide vertically.

78
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.080
That is from top to bottom.

79
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.800
So as I just imagine.

80
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.150
Right, you can see does where we have Savitri in the corner and we can then have a child.

81
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.190
The child is going to be a column widget.

82
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.430
Hopefully you guessed this correctly and should read.

83
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.970
The first side is going to be a secure avatar because we just need a profile photo by the.

84
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.730
Okay.

85
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.360
And radius is as though it are around.

86
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.829
It's going to be, we can say 50.

87
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.980
And background color.

88
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.730
As you see this, you can see colors starts.

89
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.770
Darts.

90
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.340
Grey K is nice to see and you can see it just here.

91
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.810
Okay.

92
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.090
Okay.

93
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.580
You can see, I think is way too big to say if you stand and see.

94
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.780
Okay.

95
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.210
Okay.

96
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.550
Okay, okay, okay, great.

97
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.440
We can just leave it for now like this.

98
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.730
We can stay that later.

99
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.610
And as you know, the sequester has the background image.

100
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.320
Right, which is going to be a network image.

101
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.760
But we could just leave that for now.

102
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.430
And now we can then have.

103
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.370
The icon.

104
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.470
Widgets that's going to be clickable.

105
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.560
So all we can do, we can grab this with an inkwell.

106
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.250
Okay.

107
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.250
Well, or we can just wrap this.

108
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.550
Yeah, we can dress up this little equal for now.

109
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.200
The inkwell and chide is an icon.

110
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.470
I call widgets.

111
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.110
I can start.

112
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.870
I calls it the war.

113
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.770
I think we have the we right.

114
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.980
Okay.

115
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.720
Favor.

116
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.360
Right.

117
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.800
Okay.

118
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.840
Let's think.

119
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.530
Think it's spelled F, a, v or R.

120
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.590
Okay, this and no.

121
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.820
You okay?

122
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.270
Is control necessary?

123
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.430
Let's check it out.

124
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.260
Are you going to sit over here?

125
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.230
Okay.

126
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.660
Now we can say caller and is going to be colors dark red.

127
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.250
And we can increase the size of the icon to 40.

128
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.750
Is contract to save.

129
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.550
And of course it.

130
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.740
Okay.

131
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.300
Now all we want is at the bottom of each icon.

132
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.540
We want to have the test.

133
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.430
That is how many likes we currently have.

134
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.190
So what we can do is instead of this, we can just get rid of this for now.

135
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.810
Look over this equal.

136
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.530
And we're going to have a cola right here.

137
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.530
You're going to see why subtly call them widgets.

138
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.000
And it's going to be children.

139
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.580
Their first child is then going to be this.

140
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.710
Okay.

141
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.720
Use control necessary.

142
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.550
Okay.

143
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.700
And added in the comma and the second widget is going to be a test widget now.

144
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.150
Okay.

145
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.600
You can easily understand this.

146
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.040
Now we can say one.

147
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.360
Point 2000 likes.

148
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.490
Nods Q's legs and STI test sti.

149
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.420
Okay.

150
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.050
For now, you can just change the color to colors though.

151
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.390
Why?

152
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.400
And use control necessary and go check it out.

153
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.670
Are you going to sit on there?

154
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.700
Okay.

155
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.690
Great.

156
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.520
Now all we can do within this column.

157
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.060
It's in this column which, as we can see, may assist elements main as this elements.

158
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.260
Dodd made us an amendment, a supplemental space.

159
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.930
Equally so we want that.

160
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.600
This and this two have equal space.

161
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.610
Okay.

162
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.330
Okay.

163
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.100
You can see now.

164
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.630
Okay.

165
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.980
So what we can then do is we can say.

166
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.190
You can basically just copy this column.

167
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.200
It's fancier and additional comma and paste this.

168
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.440
Is.

169
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.520
And this is save.

170
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.180
And this is going to be.

171
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.650
Let's see if we have an Arkansas comment.

172
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.330
Okay, we do.

173
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:30.700
Okay.

174
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:33.679
Okay.

175
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.080
Okay.

176
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.470
Okay.

177
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:34.830
Okay.

178
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.919
Okay.

179
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:37.559
Okay, okay.

180
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.130
You can see.

181
00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.570
And we can see comments.

182
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.480
It's just going to be 2200 comment.

183
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.640
