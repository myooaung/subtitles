00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.950
In this lecture, we're going to store all our details in the Cloud Store database, but before then,

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
we're going to create an account in order to be sure of what we did in the previous lecture.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.400
But before we create an account, make sure you call in the function in the right place.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.340
Before I take a call.

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.270
It is over the signup.

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.010
You can see we have to sign up.

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.560
One is this and the other is for create a seller's account.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
So make sure you call in the function in this first sign up.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.770
That is for this.

12
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.460
Okay.

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.450
So now what we can do is we can open a new seminar.

14
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.250
And.

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.370
At sports.

16
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.340
And you can click on this.

17
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.630
Sign up.

18
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.020
It's going to print.

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.840
Please fill.

20
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.530
Must not be empty.

21
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.100
Okay.

22
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.800
Now let's try to create an account.

23
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.650
Okay.

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.700
Full name.

25
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.980
The full name is going to be my colleague.

26
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.320
Macaulay Famous and the email address is going to be my colleague.

27
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.710
Famous at Gmail that's come.

28
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.790
And the password is going to be a M.C. We're just going to click on this to make sure it's correct and

29
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.110
we're going to click on Sign Up.

30
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.450
And you can see something is going on over here.

31
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.120
Account has been created.

32
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.280
So all we can do.

33
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.260
Navigate to the.

34
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.010
I think over here we can just get to this and then go back to users and you're going see the create

35
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.710
created user or via.

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.140
My kids think I've been beaten beat network issues but.

37
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.110
You're going to see the user.

38
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.250
You can see over here we have the email address.

39
00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.870
My colleague, famous and the provider is email and password and it was created at Jill Juicery July

40
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.280
nine, 2022.

41
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.240
And whenever a user has been created, a UID is automatically going to be generated for that user.

42
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.040
And that is what we have over here.

43
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.070
So now you can see we don't have the full name.

44
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.640
So what we can do is within the cloud store or the file store database, we can store all our details

45
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.310
and the structure is going to be like this.

46
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.210
We are going to have a collection called Users or we are going to have a folder called Users.

47
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.110
So you can see this collection as a folder or where all our documents or users are going to be stored.

48
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.590
Okay.

49
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.390
So we just have a collection called Users, so click on this and each user is going to be connected

50
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.850
to that folder called users or each users is going to be connected to this collection.

51
00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.300
Based on something known as UID or ID, we can create it or we can also generate it by clicking on this.

52
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.390
And each user is going to have the full name, the full name field and you can see this is going to

53
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.930
be a test.

54
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.910
So it is a type of string.

55
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.100
If it were to be a number we can specify it's going to be a number, but this is a test.

56
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.620
So the name can be marked and the user can have an email.

57
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.380
Field, which is a test so we can say.

58
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.500
Mark, that's Gmail.

59
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.610
That's com.

60
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.500
You can click on Save.

61
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.740
And you're going to see it shortly.

62
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.640
You can see over here, this is the user code, Mac.

63
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.670
And you can see the link between this user and this folder or collection is this.

64
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.550
So like I told you, which is going to be connected to this user's collection based on something known

65
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.610
as UID.

66
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.410
Okay.

67
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.770
So for now we just have one document or we just have one user so we can have another user or other documents.

68
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.800
So we can also generate that and the full name.

69
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.380
It's going to be, John.

70
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.260
And.

71
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.400
The email is going to be Jon at gmail dot com.

72
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.830
Okay.

73
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:22.330
So we have to document now or we have to use this or we have to files inside this collection or inside

74
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.590
this directory.

75
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.220
So you can see this as a directory or a collection where all our files or documents are going to be

76
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.820
stored.

77
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.610
And for now, we have just two documents.

78
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.120
Okay.

79
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.270
But we are not going to be creating this manually, right?

80
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.520
We're going to be creating it immediately.

81
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.320
A user is being created.

82
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.520
Okay.

83
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.240
So in order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VTS code.

84
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.770
So for that and we can just close this and.

85
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.520
And this we can then go to the controller.

86
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.150
Okay.

87
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.580
Now we're going to be using the package which we had earlier installed, which is called the Cloud File

88
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.650
Store, which we have over via the cloud store.

89
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.860
So we are going to need to import this package.

90
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.120
Head back to the controller class and now we can use controller and B to make this wide.

91
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.230
And over here we can as well create a final variable and we can just go ahead and specify the type of

92
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.900
variable it is a type of firebase.

93
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.300
Faster and we can call this dribble on the score faster.

94
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.440
It's going to be equal to five base fire star dot esters.

95
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.030
Okay.

96
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.010
If for any reason it does not get imported, you can just alight in this contract dot.

97
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.530
Okay, so now what we can do, you can see over here.

98
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.400
So for that over here.

99
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.790
We are simply saying if these fields are not empty, then we want to create the user.

100
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.410
So what we can do is we can store the results or the value in, say, a variable.

101
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.180
So over here we can store the results variable called create.

102
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.530
That is the short form of credential because this variable is going to have access to all the user data.

103
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.370
So you can say it's equal to and it wants us to specify the type of variable it is, a type of something

104
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.360
known as user.

105
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.950
User.

106
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.640
Creed.

107
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.250
Creed.

108
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.490
Okay, great.

109
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:36.170
So this creed has this creed has access to all the user values such as the.

110
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.960
The UID of the user.

111
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.330
The email sword oc.

112
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.850
So now all we can do is after creating the user, we are going to need to store all the data in the

113
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.100
Cloud Store database.

114
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.650
So to do that, it's going to take some time.

115
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.800
So as well, we need to wait for this wait.

116
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.420
And now we can call that on the score.

117
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.220
Fire.

118
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.710
Store collection.

119
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.000
And the first step we did was to create a user's collection.

120
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.540
Right.

121
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.900
So this is going to be use this.

122
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.880
And now, like I told you, each user is referred to as a document.

123
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.200
So we're going to need to say dot doc.

124
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.840
And like I said, each is going to be connected to something known as UID.

125
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.530
So what we can do is over here, we can then say create.

126
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.360
Creed.

127
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.200
Dots, user dots.

128
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.840
UID So I basically have access to this user.

129
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.930
UID And we are using this for the user.

130
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.240
And we can add in our check over here.

131
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.640
And now we can then say dots sets.

132
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.530
This is going to be a map.

133
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.760
A mop is basically something that has a property name and a property value in JavaScript.

134
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.180
This is referred to as objects and I think in Python this is referred to as a dictionary.

135
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.930
So now we're going to need to store the full name.

136
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.130
You can say full name.

137
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.250
It's going to be a full name.

138
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.860
That is just for them.

139
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:19.390
Okay.

140
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.060
And we also need the email address.

141
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.470
Okay.

142
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.990
Email.

143
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.820
Now we're not going to be saving the password because it's going to be a secret between the user and

144
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.320
our mobile application.

145
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.260
So this is basically all we need.

146
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.610
So what we can do is we can give this a how to start.

147
00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:48.420
And while it is also stated it can delete those to this user we have or via.

148
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.020
Sorry.

149
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.040
Click on this.

150
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.130
And delete.

151
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.740
Accounts OC delete.

152
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.970
Okay.

153
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.320
Waiting for you to get deleted.

154
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.930
They did it, said my colleague Jim Club.

155
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.920
And we can check to make still.

156
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.450
But you can just go ahead and try us.

157
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.710
After I created an account, you're going to see the user over here.

158
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.160
And you're going to see the user over here as well.

159
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440
So we can as well delete this collection.

160
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.790
So click on this.

161
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.180
And you're going to see this collection and we're going to delete the collection card.

162
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:33.830
Users.

163
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.230
Okay, delete.

164
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.210
Okay.

165
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.540
Since we don't have it, it's going to automatically create it.

166
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.550
You can see over via.

167
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.380
It's going to create.

168
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.850
I just have to wait.

169
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.880
I think it's taking longer than expected.

170
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.890
But you can just go ahead and create an account.

171
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.420
While I wait for for mine.

172
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.190
It's going to get rid of this.

173
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.510
Get rid of this.

174
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.870
And.

175
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.810
I think it's still loading.

176
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.000
Och or.

177
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.170
Okay.

It's going to be hard to start this app now.

180
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.210
And.

181
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.310
Or we start out.

182
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.070
We start.

183
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.040
Okay.

184
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.710

190
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.510
It's going to take some time.

191
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.760
That was why we have to wait for it.

192
00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.730
Okay.

193
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.420

195
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.280
Okay.
