00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lecture, we're going to talk about roles now.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.810
What we're going to be doing this lecture is we are going to have to box and those two box are going

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.460
to be displayed horizontally.

6
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.770
That is from left to right.

7
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.490
So now what we can do is we can get rid of this pattern we widget.

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.890
But before then we can add the critical mass of here to know where it ends.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.840
Now use control and save.

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.840
And now we can then get rid of it.

11
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.220
Or via.

12
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.570
And it's ends.

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.310
Yeah.

14
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.820
Now, in order to display widgets horizontally, that is from left to right, we are going to be using

15
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.890
the widget known as Row.

16
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.800
The row can take multiple widgets, so it asks this to drain as its property.

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.860
And the first child is going to be a container.

18
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.670
And we can give this container a width.

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.180
That is how wide is going to be a width of red and as well how long is going to be that is the height

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.340
and we can give it 50 and now we can give a color to this container.

21
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.570
We can say colors dot pink that is controlled save.

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.150
You're going to see it over here.

23
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.780
OC as well.

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.910
We can add the newcomer and have another container or another box.

25
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.360
As well.

26
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.370
We can give this a width of hundred.

27
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.700
Had a height of 50.

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.100
And now we can say color.

29
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.260
It's going to be colors the black.

30
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.780
Okay.

31
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.710
You concur, and that's save.

32
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.560
And you're going to see it over here.

33
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.350
Okay, now we can give space between these two box.

34
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.940
So over here, we can use a widget node as sized box.

35
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.190
Now we are given the space.

36
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.610
Horizontally.

37
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.280
So this is going to be width.

38
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.920
Weeds of pain.

39
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.970
How do you recover and lose control?

40
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.300
And that's the save.

41
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.710
Okay.

42
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.690
We can even say.

43
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.400
20.

44
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.480
So this is going to go more wider.

45
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.360
Okay.

46
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.900
Great.

47
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.210
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
