00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.230
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.200
In this lecture we're going to have to icons over year one is going to be for the uploading images and

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.140
the other is going to be for uploading the products.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.670
Okay, now before then, you can see we have this product description test field and over here we are

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.730
saying the mouse lens is going to be under.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.760
That is how many words the test form field can contain.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.729
But since this is for the product description, we can increase the mass then to 200.

9
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.750
So it's on red and use control and save now.

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.710
Okay.

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.930
And now we are going to create the two icon button over here.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.480
And I said one is going to be for uploading images and the other is going to be for uploading the product.

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.090
Okay.

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.850
Now to do this, we have to have a comma over here and order to have a very good format.

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.920
And within the scaffold, the scaffold has this property which you've not seen before, floats an action

16
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.720
button and.

17
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.210
These two icons are going to be displayed horizontally, that is from left to right.

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.760
So for this purpose, we're going to be using a row widget and children and the first child of the row

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.110
is going to be floating.

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.670
Floats an action button to the press which is a function and we need the channel cover by.

21
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.420
It also has a property known as child.

22
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:45.960
And for the child it's going to be an icon an icon widget and this is going to be icons that for two.

23
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:56.540
So I think we have the icons this photo then library like this and I think we need another ad you're

24
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.200
trying to cover.

25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.120
And how they're trying to cover is and that's the save and go check it out.

26
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.380
So you're going to see it over here.

27
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:15.660
Okay, look, you can sit over there, and what we can do is we can copy this and duplicate this.

28
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.590
Then this is going to be for the whole plot.

29
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.980
Okay.

30
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.310
Hard.

31
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.280
You're trying to come here and use control and has to save and go check it out.

32
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.350
You can see it right over here.

33
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.010
That is horizontally, right.

34
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.590
And now what we can do is the RO has a property known as main as its alignment and we can say main us

35
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.180
alignments dot end.

36
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.920
Okay.

37
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.530
You're going to see the riot now.

38
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.540
And now we can give space between these to high com.

39
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.860
To do that we have to wrap this floating action button with a pattern as well.

40
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.510
We can take this to icons to the right or to the left.

41
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.490
To do that, you have to grab this row, the parent row, because within the parent row we have this

42
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.400
to widget, right?

43
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.920
So wrapping this row with a pattern is going to move both together, right?

44
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.920
What we basically want to move each of them.

45
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.750
To do that, we have to wrap this floating action button with a pattern.

46
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.720
PA then.

47
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.190
With pardon, and instead of horse sides, we can say that holy, we are basically specify the pardon

48
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.650
we need for just a particular hedge.

49
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.840
And this is going to be right ten.

50
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.560
Okay.

51
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.460
How come you're in this country and that's to save.

52
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.930
And since.

53
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.440
Good.

54
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.030
Since good.

55
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.810
Seems good.

56
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.770
Since good.

57
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.330
Maybe we could also rob this role with iPad in.

58
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.640
And maybe ten.

59
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.690
In this country needs to save and see what's going to do.

60
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.740
Okay.

61
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.870
Kid is going to move us together.

62
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.800
You can see.

63
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.410
Okay.

64
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.220
I'm just going to get rid of that.

65
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.079
Okay.

66
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.660
Okay.

67
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.850
Look.

68
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.480
Good, guys.

69
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.880
See you in the next leg.
