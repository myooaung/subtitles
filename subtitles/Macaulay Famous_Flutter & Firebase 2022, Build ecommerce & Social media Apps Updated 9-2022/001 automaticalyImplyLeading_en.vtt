00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.710
In this lecture, we are going to get rid of the overflow error we saw the other time.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.170
Okay, now I'm going to show you this again.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.000
After successfully creating an account, the next step is to log in to the created accounts, and I

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.960
think I have an email address associated with Mark.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.530
Poor.

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.880
My poor.

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:40.700
At Gmail dot com and the password is being g-a-y c and we have to click on the log in button and this

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.850
is going to take us to the customer on screen.

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.250
Now you can see we have this overflow here and the reason for this error is because there is an invisible

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.300
heart over here.

13
00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.200
And the reason you can see this is because default, the error has a white color.

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.040
And since the background is white, so you're definitely not going to be able to see this.

15
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.310
Okay.

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.790
So we can click on this.

17
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.390
Okay.

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.220
You can see it took us back to the previous route or the previous page.

19
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.200
Okay.

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.280
Now, one of the ways to do this is we have to head back to our VTS code and then the home screen where

21
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.750
we have that high bar.

22
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.830
Right.

23
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.320
Okay.

24
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.880
Homescreen And over here you can see we have the harbour and we have the search screen over there.

25
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.930
And what we can do, we can use control and B to make this slide.

26
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.240
Now it's in the harbour.

27
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:49.840
The harbour has a property known as automatic to automatically imply leading.

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.180
Hopefully I can pronounce that well.

29
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.010
Okay.

30
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.190
And sorry.

31
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.100
Automatically imply.

32
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.800
Then we're going to set it to force.

33
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.360
Okay.

34
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.620
That means we do not want to go back to the previous page.

35
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.340
Okay.

36
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.270
It's transitive and you're not going to see it anymore.

37
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.040
Look can see we can no longer go black.

38
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.360
So this is one of the ways to get rid of that in order to stop us from going back to previous roots.

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.310
We also need this for the profile I think we have.

40
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.660
You can see we have this back arrow where you can see different.

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.530
It has a colour of white and we are able to see this since the background is not white.

42
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.630
Okay.

43
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.500
Now we have to get rid of that.

44
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.770
Right.

45
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.000
Okay.

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.340
So we have to do the same thing.

47
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.680
That is the automatically imply leading.

48
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.740
So we have to go to the profile screen and yeah, we are currently within the customer.

49
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.710
Sorry, not customer but customer scroll view.

50
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.130
And this custom scroll view has a property known as Seavers.

51
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.560
And the first child of the Seavers we had is the Seaver Harper, which is more like the Harper.

52
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:22.050
So this Seaver Harper has a has a property known as automatically imply leading.

53
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.880
And we have set this to first use control and se now to save and we check it out.

54
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.430
Definitely.

55
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.720
We're going to have this.

56
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.760
Okay.

57
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.350
God.

58
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.420
Sounds good, right?

59
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.650
And we can no longer go back and.

60
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.580
We just have to check for the cut screen.

61
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.900
We had it there as well.

62
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.090
Okay.

63
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.290
We're going to sort it out later and we're going to use a much better way to resolve all these issues,

64
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.820
all these black issues.

65
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.870
Definitely.

66
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.350
We won't be able to go back from the from the car screen.

67
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.710
Right.

68
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.400
Okay.

69
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.100
We're going to sort that that in the future.

70
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.990
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
