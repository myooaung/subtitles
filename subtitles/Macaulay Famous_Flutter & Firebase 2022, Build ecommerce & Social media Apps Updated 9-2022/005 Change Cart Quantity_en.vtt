00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.560
Our guys work.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:09.750
In this lecture, we are going to be able to increment the quantity of the products and also the increment,

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.440
the quantity of the product.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.200
To do this, the first step is we have to go to the models territory and then the product model five

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.040
and over here.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.990
What we can then do is we can create a function and we are going to call the function increase.

7
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.310
Okay.

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.460
And hope we just have to say, is quantity.

9
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.790
Quantity.

10
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.480
Plus.

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.790
Plus, right.

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.020
That is basically we want to add one to it whenever the button is clicked.

13
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.820
Okay.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.650
And now we have to go to the provider directory and then the cards on the score.

15
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.920
Provider, dot, dot fi.

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.300
And over here.

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.730
We are going to create a function again and we are going to call this function.

18
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.400
Inquiry.

19
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.310
In Cree -- OC.

20
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.110
And the first step is to have access to this function over here.

21
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.050
And you can see this function is within this product class.

22
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.160
So what we can then do is over here we can create a variable called product and we can just go ahead

23
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.240
and specify it is a type of the product's model and we are going to call this variable product.

24
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.010
And all we just have to say is to say product.

25
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.640
Products then dot increase.

26
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580
Sorry, dot increase.

27
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.220
Okay.

28
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.480
Creitz.

29
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.250
And lastly, we have to call the notify list in order to check for the changes we are making and update

30
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.270
it real time.

31
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.140
Okay.

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.670
And this is basically it.

33
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.050
And now what we have to do is to call the function in the in the car screen.

34
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.920
Okay.

35
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.920
Cut screen content B and we have this plus icon over here.

36
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.250
Right.

37
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.450
And we the function we then have to say cuts.

38
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.270
Provider.

39
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:39.240
But what does increment and you can see is asking for the product and all we just have to say is cut.

40
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.100
Provider.

41
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.040
Then let's get items.

42
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960
Then we want to assess each item by their index.

43
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.460
Okay.

44
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.590
And how this okay.

45
00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.560
And what we can then do is we can get rid of this and we have to say cut provider to display the quantity

46
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.450
cut provider.

47
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.400
Card provider.

48
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.550
Then.

49
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.850
Okay.

50
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.500
Then does what?

51
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.910
Get items then in dance.

52
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.780
And basically we just want to assess the quantity and this is a number, so we have to convert this

53
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.250
to a string.

54
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.250
And this is basically it's okay.

55
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.090
Okay.

56
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.960
Okay.

57
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.460
Let's go try this out.

58
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.960
Now click on this.

59
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.010
Okay.

60
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.050
Click on this.

61
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.950
Cisco.

62
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.290
I'm just going to another.

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.830
And this.

64
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.840
Maybe from the electronics.

65
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.830
Sorry.

66
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.390
And the clinics and.

67
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.170
Two cards.

68
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.910
Click on this to go check it out.

69
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.430
And currently.

70
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.740
Default is set to one.

71
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.750
Okay.

72
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.720
Sounds cool.

73
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.920
And now we are going to be able to increment the increments from my English.

74
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.370
Okay.

75
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.730
And back to what the model is dietary and then the product model.

76
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.030
And we have to create another function and we are going to call this decrease.

77
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.420
The crease the that.

78
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.310
And all we just have to say is call the quantity again.

79
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.290
Quan t.

80
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.100
T.

81
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.400
And we are going to minus now.

82
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.910
Okay, that is minus one.

83
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.660
And now we have to head back to the provider directory and then the cards provider.

84
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:07.510
And over here we can create another function and we are going to call this function the CRE myth.

85
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.600
Okay as well.

86
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.520
We can specify the repo is going to be a type of product and product.

87
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.470
And we have to then core the products.

88
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.210
Then what?

89
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.770
This is going to be decreased.

90
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.710
And in order to get that screen change, we have to say notify listing.

91
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.020
You can see why when we click on this, it's going to update its real time.

92
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.580
Right?

93
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:45.860
So this is the work of does the work of this notify listener to check for changes we are currently making.

94
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.120
So the cuts.

95
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.120
Right.

96
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:57.380
And in order to use this notify listing efficiently, what we needed to do was to extend from the change

97
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.310
notifier.

98
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.980
And now back to the cut screen.

99
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.820
Cut screen.

100
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.570
Cut screen.

101
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.740
Where you and.

102
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.600
And this is the minus icon.

103
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.710
So this is going to be what cuts provider.

104
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.240
To get items and once assess each item.

105
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.180
Each item and currently we have three item rights.

106
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.490
We want to assess each item.

107
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.280
By the index.

108
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.170
Index is basically 012012.

109
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.500
Right.

110
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.070
Okay.

111
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.750
Good.

112
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.050
And.

113
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.460
And.

114
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.040
And so.

115
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.590
Not this.

116
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.780
Copywriter George.

117
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.520
That's.

118
00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.110
I think we call this document and this is going to be cost provider.

119
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.400
To get items and we want to assess them by the index and others via.

120
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.170
Can try and save.

121
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.030
And go check this out.

122
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.790
Okay.

123
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.710
Like on this we are able to.

124
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.940
You do command?

125
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.350
He wants a zero minus.

126
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.680
We are going to sort out this.

127
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.410
I think maybe in the next lecture.

128
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.810
Okay.

129
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.750
We could also increment now and the command.

130
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.970
Right.

131
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.150
Okay, Cisco.

132
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.010
Okay, guys.

133
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.790
See you in the next lecture.
