00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.590
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.210
In this lecture, we are going to build the dashboard screen.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.380
Okay not to do this, we have to create a new FY and we are going to create this new file in the views

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.930
directory and new FY and we're going to call this dashboard.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.250
On the score screen.

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.960
And dot, dot.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.100
Okay.

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.600
And now we can use controller and beat to make this wide and we can then use a stateless widget and

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.490
of course, dashboard.

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.470
Dashboard screen.

12
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.580
And over here we need to alight and use control dots.

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.580
So impart the material that that package.

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.770
Okay.

15
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.730
Mature adults back age and get rid of this.

16
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
And that's also have access to a lot of property.

17
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.600
We can then return a scaffold.

18
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.440
Stafford.

19
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.440
Stafford And we have a property like the Harbour Harbour.

20
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.570
Harbour.

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.960
And the harbour has a property known as City, and it's going to be a test widget which is going to

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.880
say dash board.

23
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.360
Dashboard and we can add some STI to this test sti.

24
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.330
And we can give this a color of colors that.

25
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.910
White.

26
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.650
Sorry of black.

27
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.800
And this country.

28
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.770
And that's.

29
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.180
I think we need one additional parenthesis.

30
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.210
Okay.

31
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.260
It's controller, and that's the safe.

32
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.340
And now back to the sailor home.

33
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.270
Instead of this center widget, we can get rid of this and use the dashboard screen of a dashboard screen

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.950
and we start.

35
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.440
And you can see over the main file, what I simply did was to change the initial routes to the SLA home

36
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.660
screen so we don't have to log in all the time again.

37
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.030
Okay.

38
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.770
And let's go check this out.

39
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.900
Okay.

40
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.630
I think it has to check the dashboard.

41
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.680
And you can see.

42
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.240
Okay.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.300
Back to the dashboard screen over here.

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.360
We can change the harbour color to colors of white.

45
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.500
And we can't get rid of the elevation by saying elevation and setting it to zero and use control.

46
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.580
And that's the save.

47
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.770
And also, we could take this test to the meter to do that within the harbour.

48
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.190
The harbour has a property known ST altitude and therefore it's going to say it's going to be said to

49
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.200
false so we can set it to true.

50
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.410
Okay.

51
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.480
And over here we can have the logout icon.

52
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.450
To do that, we can basically use a row for this instead of using this test widget, right?

53
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.680
We could just use a row.

54
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:19.820
But within the harbour the harbour has a property known as action and we are going to have an icon.

55
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.570
Or we can just go with an icon button since it's going to be clickable.

56
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.270
And for now, it does nothing.

57
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.560
And.

58
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.800
This is going to be a high chord icon with jets and icons, the lockout.

59
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.000
Log out and K and we can give this a colour.

60
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.890
The icon has a property known as color and we can then say color the sign and apply a hydrogen color

61
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.380
and use control and save.

62
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.150
You can see it via grids.

63
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.390
And now what we can do, we can start building.

64
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.070
What is going to be in the body.

65
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.780
So over here.

66
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.280
Outside the harbour and within the scaffold.

67
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.890
We can then say, Buddy.

68
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.990
For the body.

69
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.350
This is going to be this we should send before we'd.

70
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.190
Great view.

71
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.810
That counts.

72
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.300
Okay.

73
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.450
The cross assist count is basically referring to how many items we need horizontally, that is from

74
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.380
left to right.

75
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.990
And we can then say two for this.

76
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.560
And also it has a property known as main assist alignment.

77
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.440
Elementary main are 6% for the main assistance.

78
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.780
And we can then say maybe 40.

79
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.480
And you're going to see I think you've seen this before.

80
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.560
And also for the Cross Association, we can as well.

81
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.160
Sorry.

82
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.930
Additional comment and cross our suspicion we can as well say 40 that is the cross axis has to do with

83
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.910
the horizontal shape and the main assets has to do with the vertical form.

84
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.040
That is the space we need vertically and use constraints to save in order to format this.

85
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.420
And now we can then have the children property.

86
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.390
Children.

87
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.600
And we could then get rid of this list.

88
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.200
And now what we have to say is list.

89
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.620
That.

90
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.370
Generate these to generate.

91
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.010
Basically, we are going to be returning a card.

92
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.640
So what this is asking for is how many cards we need.

93
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.090
So we are going to be needing six cards.

94
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.860
And over here.

95
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.520
We are going to get rid of this type of our function and use this type and then we are going to return.

96
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.840
Return a card widgets.

97
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.720
God, we did.

98
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.330
Okay.

99
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.280
And I think we need this.

100
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.960
Okay, great.

101
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.380
Now we are going to be using zero widgets, so we're going to be using the column widget for this again.

102
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.890
And the reason for the column is because we are going to be having an icon over here.

103
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.370
Then at the bottom, we're going to have the test.

104
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.750
I think you send this in the demo, writes the case.

105
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.220
So that's what you're going to be doing.

106
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.350
And as you know.

107
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.170
The card has a property known as child.

108
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.420
And for the child it's going to be a column budget and children.

109
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.280
And for the first child of the column, it's going to be an icon.

110
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.360
Icon.

111
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.190
This is going to be high cost the store.

112
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.780
Icons the store.

113
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.200
Okay.

114
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.020
And how to newcomer in this country and to say.

115
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.180
Okay.

116
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.150
You're going to see the view.

117
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.410
You can see we have six, right?

118
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.160
One, two, two, four, five, six and fourth.

119
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.930
It has a color of white.

120
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.320
Right.

121
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.940
And what we can also do, we can increase the size of the icon.

122
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.840
And as you know, the icon has a pretty known size.

123
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.250
And we can save 40 and use control and save.

124
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.070
Okay.

125
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.420
You can see and also we can change the color to close the sign.

126
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.970
Close.

127
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.350
Assign and use control and save.

128
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.570
And.

129
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.220
Okay.

130
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.830
Okay.

131
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:42.140
You can see and after this icon, we can then have it says for now, in the future, we're going to

132
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.180
make it dynamic, which is just going to say, maybe my store.

133
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.700
In order to recover.

134
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.890
A key.

135
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.160
Consider via my sister.

136
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.660
And we can tie this test tie.

137
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:07.490
To stay, we could increase the font size, font size, font size.

138
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.510
To maybe 23 and we could.

139
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.040
Okay.

140
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.500
You can try to save as you're trying to cover.

141
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.720
And go check it out.

142
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.340
You can see.

143
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.980
And now we can give a phone.

144
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.590
So it's this phone to wait for a tweet.

145
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.950
That boat.

146
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.130
Okay.

147
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.000
How'd you train newcomer in that or to format this?

148
00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:44.670
And as you know, the column which the column which has a property known as Maine, sees alignment and

149
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:55.320
we can see main US elements means US alignment or space around to have equal space horizontal vertically

150
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.720
that is from top to bottom.

151
00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.720
Okay.

152
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:09.840
And you can see grades and you can see we have this card over here and it has a color of whites.

153
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.840
We could also change the color.

154
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:19.820
The card has a property known as color, and we can see many colors that blue gray.

155
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:27.900
Low low grade low grade and use contrary and hence to save and good.

156
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.880
Check this out.

157
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.140
Okay.

158
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.750
Over.

159
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:39.200
Yeah, like you can see we have this blue gray color and we can also give an opacity to this.

160
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:47.570
You can say dot with opacity of maybe 0.8 and c I going to look like.

161
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.030
Okay.

162
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.420
You can see the look feels a bit and I think its look nice.

163
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.800
And what we could also do.

164
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.470
Is what we could.

165
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:02.450
Okay.

166
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.740
The card has a property known as Elevation, and you already know what this does.

167
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.960
Okay, for the now, let's say 50.

168
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.870
So you see the full use of what it does.

169
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.300
Look, you can see it looks so very, very blah and.

170
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.810
We could just go with maybe 15.

171
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.490
15 is okay and okay.

172
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.750
Seems good.

173
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.580
Looking great.

174
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.240
Right?

175
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:37.180
And maybe we could increase the icon to maybe 56 to 50.

176
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.830
And now what about.

177
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.530
Okay, let's just see what this made us is suspicion does.

178
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.770
Most of the time, you just have to try to see what it does.

179
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.510
Now we are changing it to tea.

180
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.530
And let's see.

181
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.640
You can see.

182
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.630
So the Maine asks us to do the space vertically.

183
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.440
Okay.

184
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.950
What about, say, ten?

185
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.130
In case you didn't see that key ten.

186
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.770
Use control and save and go check it out.

187
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:11.950
If you can see it's so the main assets space and has to do with the space between the vertical that

188
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.840
is the top and bottom.

189
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.560
Okay.

190
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.620
Now let's check for we're just going to go back to that.

191
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.700
Let's check for the cross our suspicion sorry.

192
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:27.850
And reduce it to maybe 20 and use country and save and check what it does.

193
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:36.190
Okay you can see so the cross answers space and acids over the horizontal the space between the left

194
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.330
and the right.

195
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.230
Right.

196
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:46.060
And the main suspicion has to do with what the vertical that is top and bottom.

197
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:54.850
So what we could also do is to wrap this with a padding, maybe padding of for all sides of 20 and use

198
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.370
control and that's the save and go check this out.

199
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.490
And I think this is a bit very cool.

200
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.280
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
