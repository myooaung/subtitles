Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.560
Then last lecture, we created the UI for our forgot password screen.

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.030
Okay, now, in this lecture, we're going to create a function.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.340
Just add the password reset link to the associated email address.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.210
Okay.

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.640
Now, first of all, you're going to try to implement this yourself because it's going to be similar.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.720
So the.

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.650
To the.

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.980
Log in users function.

11
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.580
Okay, so now just going to guide you what you're going to do with this yourself, okay?

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.130
Now for you to do this, what is it going to do first is you're going to create a function.

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.040
Right.

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.240
You're going to create a function that you're going to pass the field.

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.550
That is just the email.

16
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.950
You can see we just have one field.

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.070
So you're going to pass the fields to the commission.

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
So you're going to create this variable to study possible errors.

19
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.480
Then you're going to have to try our catch to check if that field is filled or not.

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.720
That is it of using the Firebase Odds.

21
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:14.200
The site in which email address what you're going to be is it is private all thoughts send password

22
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.890
we sent link.

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.240
Okay, so just ideas.

24
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.310
So now try to pass this video.

25
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.580
If I'm using my hand this video here, then you're going to try to do this yourself, right?

26
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.880
So like I said, it's going to be so similar to this.

27
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.200
The other different is you're not going to press in all this fields, you're just going to be passengers.

28
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.230
One field that is just the event field.

29
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.580
You're just going to check for just a single method, right?

30
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.220
So the rest is going to be the same.

31
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.520
So try to see if you can do this yourself.

32
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.250
You're going to call the function forgot password.

33
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.250
Okay, so try to see if you can do this yourself.

34
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.560
Then in this picture, I'm going to do it together.

35
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.240
Okay, guys, see you.
