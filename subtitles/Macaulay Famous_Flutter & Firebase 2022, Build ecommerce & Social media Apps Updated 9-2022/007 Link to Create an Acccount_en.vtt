00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.010
Guys, welcome.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.530
Okay.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.260
Now we're going to have to test which one is going to say need an account and the other is going to

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.280
say sign up.

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.730
Okay.

6
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.570
Now, both widgets are going to be displayed horizontally.

7
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.760
That is from left to right.

8
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.150
Okay.

9
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.550
Now, what you can do is after this code, see that we can give a to Collazo.

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.250
Okay.

11
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.160
Then after the split widgets between left to right, that is horizontally now going to be using the

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.930
widget node as row.

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.500
Okay.

14
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.680
So now what we can do is we can say row this rule as well, kind of take in multiple widgets it as the

15
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.280
to do it.

16
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.450
Okay.

17
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.940
Now the first test they're going to have.

18
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.540
Is going to need.

19
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.140
Accounts.

20
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.530
Need an account?

21
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.670
Okay.

22
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.700
There's a question mark because we are asking the user.

23
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.170
Okay, great.

24
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.610
Now, with a hard commercial where they escort you and associate.

25
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.900
Now.

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.590
Go check it out.

27
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.459
Okay.

28
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.910
Now you're going to take this to the states horizontally.

29
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.170
And to do that, they're going to be using the main Atlas alignment.

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.310
The main office alignment is going to work differently for the resources.

31
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.240
This is the horizontal flop.

32
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.870
Okay.

33
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.410
So they're going to set a main axis on that main axis alignment or center.

34
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.830
It is going to take it to the center horizontally.

35
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.090
That is from left to right, from left to right.

36
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.020
Okay, great.

37
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.590
Now as well, what we can do is we can give this tie is going to be test tie.

38
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.300
We can give a font size of 34 to make it very big.

39
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.770
Okay, then what we can do.

40
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.290
So we can also give a font with the designated font with.

41
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.890
That part.

42
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.730
Okay.

43
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.590
You're trying to come here.

44
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.830
This controversy to.

45
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.090
Okay.

46
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.340
I think this is too big.

47
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.620
First of all, this should be a count.

48
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.290
You can just make this point to.

49
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.230
Okay.

50
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.230
Okay.

51
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.740
Like I said, this is so much pushed to the top.

52
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.680
What we can do is.

53
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.910
Over here.

54
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.020
We're going to give this face.

55
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.920
Theoretically.

56
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.230
Right.

57
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.780
So there's going to be size.

58
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.230
Looks as though this is going to be vertically.

59
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.630
So it is going to be height of probably 820 as well.

60
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.680
Okay.

61
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.700
Grip.

62
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.510
Okay.

63
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.470
We can just finally leave this out.

64
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.780
Probably it's.

65
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.760
Okay.

66
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.180
Now we're gonna have to order a test kit.

67
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.020
So first of all, you're going to give a critical mass that is going to be a test.

68
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.120
So in the test field.

69
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.210
But the test that is the test, which is.

70
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.350
Okay, so what you can say is sign up.

71
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.930
Okay.

72
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.630
As we are going to do this time because this is a test cartridges, but for the sake of mustering,

73
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.890
I don't like doing that.

74
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.200
So this test study.

75
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.800
Okay, as we're going to give you a font suite is going to be fonts wait for tweets that bode that's

76
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.950
what I'm going to give you a full size to make this bigger as though it is going to give it a ten.

77
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.650
Okay, ADHD comma and go check it out.

78
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.980
Like I said, it's very close.

79
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.950
Now, what you can afford is we can give you size books.

80
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.150
Okay.

81
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.650
So this is the first test we get.

82
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.920
And this is the second test we get.

83
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.220
And there are birds in a roll with it.

84
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.000
So which makes it displayed horizontally.

85
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.680
That is from left to right.

86
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.580
Okay.

87
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.060
Now, this is the first test we get and this is the second test we get.

88
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.190
So at the middle, we can use is size books as well as books.

89
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.649
And we're going to be given this space horizontally right now, you can see.

90
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.310
But we're going to give this space or totally between this need and account on the sign up.

91
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.920
Right.

92
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.290
Okay.

93
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.330
So this is going to be with.

94
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.190
Because given the space, obviously that's left or right, there's going to be a bit of you can just

95
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.270
give a rate of ten.

96
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.360
If it's not okay, we can also change it.

97
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.850
Okay.

98
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.330
Great.

99
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.320
Now what we can do is we can make this site all clickable.

100
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.820
So to do that.

101
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.900
Okay.

102
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.730
Over this test we are going to highlight.

103
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.000
First, they were going to use control and dots.

104
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.200
They can see with that of the type.

105
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.330
So what you can do is we're going to click on what we did.

106
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.110
And this is going to be a type of inkwell.

107
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.770
We can also use a gesture detector button.

108
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.170
Okay.

109
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.920
So what you can just do is to seal it up there.

110
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.400
Yes.

111
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.630
Leave this empty.

112
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.650
Okay, good.

113
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.610
Great.

114
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.900
Now you can see.

115
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.400
This is now clickable.

116
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.850
Okay.

117
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.670
Now what you're going to do is.

118
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:40.070
First of all, you are going to create a new screen and you're going to call the screen register on

119
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.300
the score screen.

120
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.020
Okay.

121
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.880
Then what you're going to do for me is you're going to create two fields.

122
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.910
That is for the user name, probably the user name.

123
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.420
The name and.

124
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.770
Passwords.

125
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.350
So users are going to be able to register.

126
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.630
So that is going to be your assignment.

127
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.800
So what you're going to do now is, first of all, create a new screen in the heart folder for any reason.

128
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.970
If you didn't create in that article, you can also, I guess, move it there.

129
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.410
Okay.

130
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.190
So now you're going to create a new script called Register or Discourse, Create or Dot.

131
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.660
Then as well, you're going to use a stateless widget for this.

132
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.590
Then what they're going to do is you're going to create two fields, that is for the user name, the

133
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.600
email and the password.

134
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.640
So try to do that yourself.

135
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.820
Then lastly as well, you're going to create the.

136
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.430
Register button.

137
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.760
Okay.

138
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.770
So try to implement this with the knowledge you've gained over the section.

139
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.560
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
