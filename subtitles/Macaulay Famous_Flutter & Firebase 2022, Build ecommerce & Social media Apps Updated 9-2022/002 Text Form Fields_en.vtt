00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.660
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.650
Welcome.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.940
In this lecture, we are going to start building the test from fields.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.080
But remember in the last lecture, what we simply did was to use a row.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.220
And the reason for this rule is we want to have the displayed image over here and the categories and

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.560
the subcategories over here.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.280
Right.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:31.410
So for the now, what we can do is within the row widgets, we can just have a test widget which is

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.060
going to say category here and let's are going to view that this controller and has to save now and

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.370
you're going to sit right over here.

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.470
Okay.

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
And now we can build the test from field.

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.830
And to do this, we need to come out from this row widget.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.430
Right.

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.640
And as you can see, we are using the column widget in order to display all our widgets vertically.

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.080
That is from top to bottom.

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.740
Right.

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.440
So we need to come out from this row.

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.100
You had your true newcomer and now we can now resize box, size box to give you a little picture sized.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.760
Sized box and we are going to be giving this separation vertically.

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.790
So there's going to be heights of maybe 30 or 40.

22
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.510
So, okay.

23
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.760
And you can just have a child and the child is going to be a divider.

24
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.300
I think you've seen this before.

25
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.530
Divider.

26
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.550
And we can give a color of color the sign.

27
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.210
And also we could specify the thickness of the of the divider.

28
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.640
We can say 1.4.

29
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.530
Okay.

30
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.180
And I think we need to get rid of this use controller and that's the save.

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.270
And you can see the Via OC.

32
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.500
We could just say maybe like what is okay and how did your train cover?

33
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.320
Okay.

34
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.880
And now we are going to start building the test from fields.

35
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.270
And after the sandbox, we can have the newcomer and test.

36
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.000
Test.

37
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.390
Over year test.

38
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.740
Just from.

39
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.290
Failed.

40
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.060
And as you know, the test form field has a property known as decoration and this is going to be improved

41
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.220
imputes decoration.

42
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.760
And we can give a little test to this, which is going to be for the price.

43
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.990
Price.

44
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.040
And we can also give an inch test, which is more like the place order in test, which is also going

45
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.060
to be priced.

46
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.790
And what we can also do.

47
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.490
We can give a border to this to make it round, then offline.

48
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.150
Hotline in Pewds border.

49
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.640
Okay.

50
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.580
How to turn a camera and use control and save.

51
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.220
And you're going to say it right over here.

52
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.800
Okay.

53
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.090
Okay.

54
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.470
You can see it's right over there.

55
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.280
And also, we could wrap this with a pod in use controller.

56
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.640
And wrap with pattern and we can just go with eight.

57
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.800
Okay.

58
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.170
Great.

59
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.840
And what we can also do, we can reduce the size of this test foam field.

60
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.790
To do that, we're going to drop this test from field with a container or a size box.

61
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.720
Okay.

62
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.710
A light and it's control dots and wrap with size box.

63
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.020
And now we can give a width.

64
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.820
That is how wide it's going to be.

65
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.570
And to make this responsive, we can get the width of our screen by saying media query, dot contest,

66
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.210
dot size and dot weeds.

67
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.010
And we can just say we need a times.

68
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.860
Times.

69
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.770
0.38.

70
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.180
38%.

71
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.290
Okay.

72
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.790
This control NASA save.

73
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.630
You can see it over there and within the column widget, we can then say Cross us alignment and this

74
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.410
is going to be cross axis alignment that starts.

75
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.870
And go check it out.

76
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.520
You're going to say it back over here.

77
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.900
Okay.

78
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.170
And we can make this a bit rounded.

79
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.340
As you know, we have the border radius and we can then say border radius.

80
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.060
Though it's circular of maybe 15.

81
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.870
Is contrary a necessary doctrinal comma.

82
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.440
And go check it out.

83
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.710
Seems good.

84
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.130
I think worse is to have the color.

85
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.920
Okay, I'm just going to check this out.

86
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.690
And now what we can do is we can duplicate this.

87
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.770
Duplicate this.

88
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.640
It ends where?

89
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.290
Yeah.

90
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.700
Okay.

91
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.390
Had your train cover.

92
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.530
And here's this.

93
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.680
And this is going to be for the quantity.

94
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.220
Core T and just going to copy this hopefully.

95
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:42.430
Okay, I'm just going to spell this quantity city and this control and save and this is going to be

96
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.380
45% to make it to be a bit bigger.

97
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.030
So a bit wider.

98
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.130
Okay.

99
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.110
Great.

100
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.860
And.

101
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.170
Also we can.

102
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:06.300
How they trying to come over here and pace this and this is going to be for the products.

103
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.100
Okay.

104
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.490
Instead of this for the --, we can just say maybe hard quantity.

105
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.770
Hard quantity.

106
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.300
Okay.

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.710
Sounds good.

108
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.120
Okay.

109
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.620
We are going to see it when we click on it.

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.880
You can see that quantity.

111
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.510
And for this, this is going to be the product.

112
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:43.680
The product name, the lipid test and for the test is going to say maybe enter a product name.

113
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.140
Is comprehensive.

114
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:56.410
And for this, what we can just do is we can get rid of this and make the telephone field take the available

115
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.160
space.

116
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.430
Okay.

117
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.930
Okay.

118
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.510
And we're going to get rid of this.

119
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.270
And of course, we have to wrap everything up with a single child square view.

120
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.220
So over the column we can alight and use contraband dots, wrappers, widgets.

121
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.990
And we're going to wrap this with a single child curfew, and that's to make that page scrollable.

122
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.200
Okay.

123
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.930
You concur.

124
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.370
And now to save.

125
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.210
Okay.

126
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.330
Then click on this.

127
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.840
Okay.

128
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.990
It's going to adjust.

129
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.580
And what we can do is we can increase the test field size to do that.

130
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:48.050
To do that, the test home field has a property known as mass length, which which has to do with how

131
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.640
many tests we need.

132
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.300
So automatically it's going to increase the the test home field based on the test.

133
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.550
So we can just say maybe 100.

134
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.810
Okay.

135
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.050
So this is going to give us space for 100 text.

136
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.140
You can see it all via mass.

137
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.970
Mass 0.10.

138
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:11.730
Great.

139
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.430
And what we can also do.

140
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.350
You can then say my last line and maybe Siri.

141
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.130
Siri.

142
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.830
Okay.

143
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.650
Okay, great.

144
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.380
You can see it become bigger.

145
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.660
And what about if I say to you.

146
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.070
See, I don't think product name should have so much space.

147
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.720
I think this is okay.

148
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:47.600
And finally, we need another one for the description of the product.

149
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.740
Right.

150
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.620
Okay.

151
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.690
So I'm going to copy this.

152
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.130
It ends over a year.

153
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.470
How did you recover?

154
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.420
And then we can pace this.

155
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.480
Right.

156
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.510
And we're going to change this to say product.

157
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:10.910
Okay.

158
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.670
There's going to be product.

159
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.520
Product description.

160
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.120
And.

161
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.480
This is going to say enter.

162
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.690
Entire product description.

163
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.680
Okay.

164
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.370
And for this, we're going to make it five.

165
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.870
The mudslides is going to be five to make this test field a bit bigger.

166
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.030
Okay.

167
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.040
Seems good.

168
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.760
Sounds good, right?

169
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.990
This is good.

170
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.540
You can basically see all the stores and remember we are using the pods and to give space within each

171
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.170
hedge.

172
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.610
Right.

173
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.240
Okay.

174
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.060
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
