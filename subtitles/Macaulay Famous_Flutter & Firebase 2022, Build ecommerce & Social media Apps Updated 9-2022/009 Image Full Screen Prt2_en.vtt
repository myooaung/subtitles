00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.960
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:09.360
In this lecture, we are also going to have the products images over here and users are going to be

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.100
able to scroll horizontally.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.790
Not to do this, we have to head back to our via code and over the size box.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.560
We are going to have a triple camera and then we are going to create another size box and we can give

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.120
the size box a height.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.860
And in order to make this more responsive, what we can then do is we can use the media query and dot

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
of contest and the size and dot height.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.260
Then we just want to change it by times by 0.2%.

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.720
Okay.

12
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.690
You can try and save.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.900
And as you know, the size box has a property known as child.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.490
And for the child it's going to be this which you send before these for you to view the you can see

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:10.860
the list this view the builder has a property known as item builder which is going to take in the contest

16
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.230
and the hindrance.

17
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.820
And also the list view that beta has well has a property known as item counts for the item count.

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.060
We have to assess this top level variable via code image list.

19
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.480
And to do that we have to say widget, dot image list and dot lens.

20
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.060
Okay.

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.200
And now what we have to do is to return an image.

22
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.820
That's.

23
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.730
Network because this is a network image.

24
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.360
Right.

25
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.170
Okay.

26
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.520
And now we can call the image list rebel.

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.610
So.

28
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.340
We got the image.

29
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.920
At least.

30
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.800
And we have to assess each and every one of them.

31
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.940
Okay.

32
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.380
And this is basically it.

33
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.660
Now use control and save.

34
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.920
And check this out.

35
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.540
You're going to see it right now.

36
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.320
And you can see we are able to screw vertically defaults, right?

37
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.080
So what we can do is within the list view the view there.

38
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.240
It has a property known as screw direction and this is going to be how six to horizontal we can use

39
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.380
control and save.

40
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.720
Okay.

41
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.880
Okay.

42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.350
Cisco, you love this, right?

43
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.970
Okay.

44
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.210
We can't just check for other images.

45
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.470
And I think I have some products for electronics category.

46
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.580
You can see Sims go.

47
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.730
Right.

48
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.330
Okay.

49
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.630
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
