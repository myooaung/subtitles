00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.660
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.360
Now, before we continue, we are going to need to do some configurations in order for us to be able

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.510
to use images.

5
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.010
Okay.

6
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.680
Now we're going to create a new folder and we're going to create this new folder in this e-commerce

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.060
app directory.

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.510
Okay.

9
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.450
Now, to be able to easily create a folder there.

10
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.140
What we can do is we can navigate to this box back to the Yavapai.

11
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.670
Okay.

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.060
The regular click on this new for the regular first create before the code asset.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.500
Then we're going to create another folder in this asset directory and I'm going to call this folder.

14
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.240
Images.

15
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.750
Okay.

16
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.230
Now what we can do?

17
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.960
We can add some images.

18
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280
We're going to be needed throughout.

19
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.440
Okay, now I'm going to go to my files.

20
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.910
Okay.

21
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.720
This is over here.

22
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.870
I'm using the copy.

23
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.000
This copy.

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.650
Copy this as well.

25
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.240
Then copy this.

26
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.920
This and this.

27
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.420
Okay, copy.

28
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.540
The images are going to be available for you as well.

29
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.410
Okay.

30
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.160
Now we're going to go to our project, which is to get the text up.

31
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.250
I think that we call that ecommerce app.

32
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.460
Okay.

33
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.040
Because the access.

34
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.190
For the rights.

35
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.330
Okay.

36
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.150
We can click on this then images.

37
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.670
Okay, then we're just going to paste this.

38
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.990
Okay.

39
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.390
Right now.

40
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.610
What we also do is we can just cause this from our courts.

41
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.260
And although this US says we are going to create what is US's territory, right?

42
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.250
We're going to create a new folder and they're going to call this for the icons.

43
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.200
Right.

44
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.620
Okay.

45
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.320
Then we can do this here.

46
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.430
Okay, great.

47
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.610
Like the freighter or the switch.

48
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.570
Okay.

49
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.030
Now what you're going to need to do that is you're going to go back to a vicious cycle.

50
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.100
Then the prospect of the yellow fly, which is this.

51
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.460
Right.

52
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.210
First of all, Japanese culture and beats and make this white.

53
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.830
Okay.

54
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.790
Now, what we can then do is we're just going to commence this.

55
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.580
Now, the next thing to do is the the location of that.

56
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.699
I suggested to him that we just had that right.

57
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.220
So we're going to get rid of this first.

58
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.390
Okay.

59
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.410
Now that images are in a folder called.

60
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.340
Assets.

61
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.070
Okay, then this.

62
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.430
Right.

63
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.910
Okay.

64
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:37.190
So by doing this floater is going to have access to all the images within the images further.

65
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.000
Okay.

66
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.420
Now, all we just have to do this is to copy this.

67
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.090
And then there's this.

68
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.940
So there's going to be icons.

69
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.050
All right, icons, we can just give you a backslash that the backlash as well.

70
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.920
Okay then use true and s to save this.

71
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.250
Fine.

72
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.300
You got to get this.

73
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.440
We just had it.

74
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.430
So if I do this, what is going to know the location of all our images and all our icons?

75
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.660
Images for the now we just have the filter icon and the search icon.

76
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.940
Okay.

77
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.150
So you're just going to wait for us to finish that in this picture?

78
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.560
We are definitely going to continue from here.

79
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.910
Right.

80
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.200
Okay.

81
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.260
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
