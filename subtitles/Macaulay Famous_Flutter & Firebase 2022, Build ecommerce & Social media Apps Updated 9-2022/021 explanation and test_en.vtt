00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.250
Now, in the last lecture, we created this functional quadratic image, and we said we want to be able

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.650
to pick images from our gallery.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.320
Then over here, we said if the user actually picked an image that we want time, it says to the user,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.100
we says, Congratulations, your image has been uploaded.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.950
Okay, now over here we created a variable, a global variable called what is called picked image,

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.690
which is the private variable.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.650
Okay.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.230
Now also we're out.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.690
It's with.

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.480
Here's the reason for this are as is so is going to list ten for the whole that to make into the image

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.960
probably we picked the wrong image or selected the wrong image and we want to pick another.

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.290
So this is going to list in for the change of the picked image.

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.580
Okay, great.

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.840
Now over here.

17
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.380
We simply use the global variable which we created this record on.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.470
It's called Picked Image.

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.090
Then we said is equal to the errors which are listed for the changes that make it to the image that

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.160
all the data three time.

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.100
Then over here we pass this phi.

22
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.860
Because it's your type of fire, right?

23
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.330
Then over here, remember, this is a variable.

24
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.940
Right.

25
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.860
This is a variable.

26
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.630
Then we said we want to pick image from the gallery.

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.900
So over here we said pict image standards part not to get the part of that image.

28
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.610
So by doing this, we have the pict image and the global frame record of a quality image.

29
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.340
Then what are they doing over the sign of page?

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.090
What we simply did remember.

31
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.490
Over here, we have this bike on bottom, which is just over here.

32
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.140
So we said when this is clicked, it's going to trigger that peak image function we created in the hot

33
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.020
controller.

34
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.040
Right.

35
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.530
Is going to trigger it then as well.

36
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.760
Over.

37
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.930
Are you?

38
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.570
We are using the past to develop doubts toward the Pict image.

39
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.610
I remember because we are using it.

40
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.260
We are using a private function, unable to get hold of that private function.

41
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.150
So what we simply did was to override it by using the, by creating a variable.

42
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.570
By creating a variable card profile footer, we use a narrow function.

43
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.260
So we are saying this, this goes to this.

44
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.300
So automatically the value of that image is in this variable.

45
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.050
Okay.

46
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.180
Hopefully you understand this.

47
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.550
But if you do understand this is this line.

48
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.780
What I believe as the process goes, you're going to get feeds of everything.

49
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.220
Okay.

50
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.990
Now, what I'm going to do now is to try this out over a very, very strong network.

51
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.090
So now I'm going to click on this.

52
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.130
So one click on this is going to trigger this function and I want to be able to pick image from the

53
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.670
gallery.

54
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.140
So click on this.

55
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.770
Okay.

56
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.890
Now go to a gallery so we can take this image now is going to return this conversation.

57
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.290
All your image has been.

58
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.260
Your image has been uploaded.

59
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.160
Okay.

60
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.530
Because we had picked on image.

61
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.050
So now for the user name we can use.

62
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.820
First of all, we can just click on register to see what is going to happen.

63
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.020
Okay.

64
00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:01.950
Now you can see since it is now, since we don't have any value, since the email and the password,

65
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.120
the image is empty.

66
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.550
So it's going to skip this spot.

67
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.400
Then we time the has.

68
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.720
Part we say is error or create an account.

69
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.950
That is the title.

70
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.089
Please enter all field so you can see that is what you just did.

71
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.529
Okay.

72
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.890
Now what we can well do, we can actually pick a user name.

73
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.310
We can set a test.

74
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.800
Just use a.

75
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.690
Okay for the email because.

76
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.600
But leave from others by saying test.

77
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.050
User.

78
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.420
Then the password.

79
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.710
Make sure as long is going to use this zero.

80
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.220
I think we also need to hide this password.

81
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.850
The economy is the.

82
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.080
PJ Mark?

83
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.250
Yes.

84
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.310
This.

85
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.890
Okay.

86
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.790
Great.

87
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.250
Now I want to click on Register.

88
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.910
Then to get rid of this election register.

89
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.420
Okay.

90
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.550
So you can see the error.

91
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.330
Okay.

92
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.190
So you're starting to see our.

93
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.610
Our image is badly formatted.

94
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.140
Mobile while you are using it, try as well.

95
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.590
Okay.

96
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.170
So you're saying we our team is badly.

97
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.220
Formatted.

98
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.660
So now what you can.

99
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.380
So for that.

100
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.720
So now what you can do is.

101
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.610
Well at its user we can hard to heart Gmail dot com.

102
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.270
Okay.

103
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.190
Now we're going to click on now.

104
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.410
Register.

105
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.110
Okay.

106
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.920
On register, you can see we've got no hair.

107
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.190
So this went successful.

108
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.460
So now what you can do, we can click on.
