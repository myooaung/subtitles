00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.820
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.140
Walker, in this lecture, we're going to be put to other projects.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.530
Okay?

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.039
But before then, we're going to add a product to our cart.

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.520
Okay?

6
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
So I'm going to have this product hard to cart, and.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.620
The card screen.

8
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.100
Okay.

9
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.440
This is the product we're going to be ordering right now to do this.

10
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:26.660
We're going to go back to Our Vinci Code and then the screen cards screen over here.

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.010
Okay.

12
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.200
And now we can use Contra and B to make this way.

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.590
Okay.

14
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.550
Now, when the user clicks on the checkout button, we are automatically going to have them order this

15
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.090
product.

16
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.470
Okay.

17
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.190
Okay.

18
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.560
Now to do this.

19
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.230
We're going to do this over this function over there.

20
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.680
Okay.

21
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.270
Now you're going to stay on scorecards provider.

22
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.530
Okay.

23
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.530
Then that gets standard for each.

24
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.600
Okay, Jason.

25
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.120
Now, the reason for this for each is we are looking over each item the user is going to order.

26
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.600
Okay.

27
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.400
Then as well.

28
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.470
We're gonna need to display it over here.

29
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.260
And as you know, in a lot of these places like this, we're going to need to run a loop of over each

30
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.620
other.

31
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.400
Tim writes, It does exactly why we have to look.

32
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.970
So we're simply looking over our Scott's I-10, then we're going to moderate.

33
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.330
Okay.

34
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.840
Now they are going to be using the sink so you can pass the sink or via and sink or they as well.

35
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.630
Okay.

36
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.680
They were going to call it agreeable, which we have in the can just are weighted first that variable

37
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.130
which you have in the chorus, firebase tor, I think.

38
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.160
Okay.

39
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.990
Then does collection.

40
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.920
It's going to be harder now since we don't have it in the firebase.

41
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.130
It's been automatically created when we trigger this checkout.

42
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.760
Okay.

43
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.560
Then we can start diet.

44
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.130
Remember, each other is going to be connected to this other based on Heidi.

45
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.990
So all we can just do is.

46
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.420
Over here.

47
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.550
We just had some to give, which for now, later, we're going to make it more dynamic or more unique

48
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.020
so we can just say want to just want to to four or five.

49
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.420
Okay.

50
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.600
Great.

51
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.810
And so they were considered sex.

52
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.130
Okay.

53
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.030
Great.

54
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.450
Okay.

55
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.090
Now the first field we need is going to be jihadi jihad.

56
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.260
For now, we can just see one, two, two, four, five.

57
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.060
And the other field we need is the user ID.

58
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.530
Okay, we're going to get the user ID.

59
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.140
So to do that, we're going to see a firebase.

60
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.360
Arts coded rainbow dots.

61
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.550
Current user dots.

62
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.030
You ready?

63
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.470
Okay.

64
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.380
It's kind of a no margin call in this Wendy's.

65
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.150
There's no log in.

66
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.430
So that's why we are losing it so hard this.

67
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.190
As well.

68
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.130
We need the plug out.

69
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.410
Okay.

70
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.880
Sorry for the now you can just.

71
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.560
It's to.

72
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.620
And is going to be this can just win them this to.

73
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.560
Other value, rewards of other value have access to.

74
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.410
Everything that has to do with the cards either.

75
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.860
Okay.

76
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.540
So there's going to be order.

77
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.190
Value.

78
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.880
While you.

79
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.020
Don't you try to look and.

80
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.300
We need a prize.

81
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.000
It's going to be harder.

82
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.440
Value.

83
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.800
That prize and.

84
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.610
As well.

85
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.300
We need the image of a hell.

86
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.610
There's no order but you.

87
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.030
That's immeasurable.

88
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.279
You're going to need to hardy trained core.

89
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.670
And as well, we need our medical products.

90
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.540
These are ones that is that I mean the same products using what is in other words you.

91
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.630
That quantity.

92
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.940
Okay.

93
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.360
As well.

94
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.410
You need to drink over.

95
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.140
And order dates.

96
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.060
But we can just see time.

97
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.440
So.

98
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.200
Time.

99
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.760
Time.

100
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.610
It's time.

101
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.610
Okay.

102
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.570
Dutch now.

103
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.690
Okay.

104
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.200
This is basically it's.

105
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.610
Okay.

106
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.490
We can.

107
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.570
Once we start this.

108
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.190
Well to start in.

109
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.390
Okay.

110
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.470
It is going to take some time to restart that.

111
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.990
Then we can try it out.

112
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.820
Okay.

113
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.210
Okay.

114
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.600
Okay.

115
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.050
Okay.

116
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.350
Okay.

117
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.770
That's good.

118
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.160
Check.

119
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.300
Okay.

120
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.350
Now we can.

121
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.540
Okay.

122
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.240
I think we can.

123
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.510
Click on this to cards.

124
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.750
And.

125
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.190
They could check out.

126
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.630
Okay, we can just check.

127
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.140
I'd seminar to make sure this there.

128
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.680
Before checking to.

129
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.390
Okay.

130
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.140
I think you did.

131
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.720
This is going to break our hearts.

132
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.580
Okay.

133
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.570
But birds and sea.

134
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.130
Okay.

135
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.260
I don't really think there's any issues.

136
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.490
Okay, now let's go and check and I'm going to go to this and.

137
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.190
Rules and advantages.

138
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.050
So it was when you finish this.

139
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.080
Okay.

140
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.620
Great.

141
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.390
We have it.

142
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.900
Okay.

143
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.780
You can see this is the image area of the product.

144
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.180
This is the order date.

145
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.630
It was ordered a may ten, 20, 20.

146
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.060
So I think this date is wrong.

147
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.450
Okay.

148
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.780
Yeah.

149
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.530
Today's meeting.

150
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.330
Yeah.

151
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.820
And this is the other I.D..

152
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.960
We're going to make this unique.

153
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.140
And this is the price.

154
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.640
This is the quantity.

155
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.130
Right.

156
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.190
And this is the tie to iPhone and this is the user ID.

157
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.520
Okay.

158
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.590
We can just copy this and grant check if we have this user.

159
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.760
Okay.

160
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.610
Okay.

161
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.000
Users and.

162
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.060
I don't know.

163
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.220
There's a way to search.

164
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.790
Okay.

165
00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.740
To.

166
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.760
Okay.

167
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.300
Um.

168
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.580
Okay.

169
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.300
Really?

170
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.830
I don't know what it says anymore.

171
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.050
But there should be a way.

172
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.490
Okay.

173
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.370
Okay.

174
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.630
I'm just going to leave that for now.

175
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.300
Okay.

176
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.610
So you can see this is it's.

177
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.250
We can physically harden their products and.

178
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.370
You can just get rid of this.

179
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.080
And had this.

180
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.470
Yeah.

181
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.090
Cards and check outs.

182
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.980
Okay.

183
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.020
I think you can see it's what it does.

184
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.750
What you just did was to update this.

185
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.810
And the reason for this is because our I.D. is not unique.

186
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.690
So it assumes it's is just the same product and we just want to update it.

187
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.930
So that is the need of the hide.

188
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.980
So it's going to be NI is going to need to be unique, but currently it is not unique.
