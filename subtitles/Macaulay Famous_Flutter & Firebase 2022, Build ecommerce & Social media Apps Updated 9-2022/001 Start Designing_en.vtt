00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.290
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.980
In this lecture, we're going to start designing the customer landing page, but before then, we need

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.540
to get rid of this row.

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.450
Now, what we can do, we can add the newcomer to this and use control necessary in order to know where

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.620
the row has.

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.900
And now we can then get rid of this.

8
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.970
All our widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.400
That is from top to bottom.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.150
So for this reason, we're going to be using a column widget to wrap everything up column.

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.000
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets.

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.970
So it asks this to drill as this property.

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.740
And the first.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.420
Widget is going to be a role.

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240
You're going to see why shortly.

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.380
And I think you're right in what it does.

17
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.410
And now we can then have the children, the first child of the role is going to be obsessed with that,

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.630
which is just going to say, create a customer.

19
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.660
What we can do is we can use double quotes in order for us to use a single quote so we can say create.

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.510
Customers single quote.

21
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.830
Sorry.

22
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.550
Create customers accounts.

23
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.230
Okay.

24
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.190
That is true, and that's to save.

25
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.650
You're going to see it via.

26
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.290
Okay.

27
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.120
Now, what we can do is within the column, the column has the property known as main axis elements.

28
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.950
Main axis.

29
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.700
Elements main assist elements dot center.

30
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.670
So this is going to take it to the centre or the metre.

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.680
So what we can do, we can add, it will come over here and you're going to see it over here.

32
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.310
Okay.

33
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.340
Now the test widget has a property known as STI and we can say test style, test tie.

34
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.540
Okay.

35
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.490
We can give a full size of 25.

36
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.090
And.

37
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.650
There's a full suite.

38
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.610
First weeks.

39
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.730
Dot boat.

40
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.870
Okay.

41
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.090
Is Katrina safe and go check it out.

42
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.470
Okay.

43
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.400
We can just make this smaller by, say, maybe 20 or.

44
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.920
It then.

45
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.330
Okay, great.

46
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.340
Now we can ask you to recover and recover, and you can try this now within the rule.

47
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880
We can have other widgets, which is going to be an I call button icon.

48
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.250
I called button.

49
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.320
You can see the icon button has the property known as odd press, which is a function.

50
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.210
And for the icon this is going to be icons, icons, widgets.

51
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.620
Icons that.

52
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.460
Okay.

53
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.610
And now, sorry if we did this over here and now we can say sorry that I cause what I call error.

54
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.870
So this is going to be high.

55
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.680
Cause that person you can just say person.

56
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.410
Okay.

57
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.000
He's going to try to answer save and you're going to see it over here because it's within the row.

58
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.630
Okay.

59
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.460
And now we can increase the size of the icon, the icon which just has a property known as size, we

60
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.870
can say size of 35 to make it a bit big.

61
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.940
Okay.

62
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.580
Okay.

63
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.920
And the icon widget also has a property known as color.

64
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.250
So you can say color is going to be colors, dots.

65
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.500
We can say colors the card.

66
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.410
And use control and save.

67
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.220
Okay.

68
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.750
Great.

69
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.329
The lastly, the raw widget as well has a property load as well as element is going to be made as is

70
00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.440
element dot.

71
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.990
The space between it's going to be the opposite of the column.

72
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.810
So had your cover and go check it out.

73
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.580
Okay.

74
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.360
Great.

75
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.700
Okay.

76
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.930
Looking nice, right?

77
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.730
Okay, guys.

78
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.210
See you in the next lecture.
