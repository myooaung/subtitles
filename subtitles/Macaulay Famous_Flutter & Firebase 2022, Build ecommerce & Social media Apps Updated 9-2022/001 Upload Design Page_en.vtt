00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.750
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.490
Welcome in this section.

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.770
Rebel creates the functionality in order to enable users upload products.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.690
Now, to do this, this is going to be similar to the registration page.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.880
You can see over here we are able to pick image from the gallery.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.430
And over here we created one, two, two, four, five fields in order to grab the inputs of the user.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.770
That is the full name of the user.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.190
The user name of the user, the email of the user, the phone number of the user, and the password

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.970
of the user.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.320
So you can basically just go about all these fields to the product name, the product price, the product

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.020
description, the product category and so on.

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.220
Right?

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.640
Then it's not the registration button you can call this upload.

14
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.040
Then instead of uploading all this data to the users collection.

15
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.050
You can basically just upload them.

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.600
So the dots collection.

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.740
Okay, you can see over here in the in the controller directory.

18
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.170
In the controlled territory.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.100
And contrary and be.

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.810
Over here is the function image from the gallery or view.

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.040
What we simply did is we made it dynamic so we can easily just we use this and choose either upload

22
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.480
uploaded.

23
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.110
Okay.

24
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.640
Well, you can see we are passing the size.

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.610
So whenever we call this pic image function, we are going to need to pass in the value.

26
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.450
Okay.

27
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.270
Then you can see in the registration page.

28
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.420
Okay, Art.

29
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.910
So I think this is in the OC.

30
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.210
You can see over in the sign up page when we call the function card pick image, we now have to pass

31
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.570
the the value that is the source value so that the source is going to be gallery.

32
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.720
So what we can easily do is we can we copy this and instead of source we can as we'll see camera.

33
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.180
Okay.

34
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.340
So that's what we're simply doing.

35
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.710
So if you know how to do this, definitely you already know how to enable users been able to upload

36
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.250
projects.

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.020
So this is basically it then over and over and.

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.590
Over in the arts controller.

39
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.020
So I think controllers for the end of the year, you can see we are simply uploading all the data to

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.000
the users collection.

41
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.030
So instead of the user's collection, you can upload it.

42
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:48.540
So the products to the product collection over a year and remember in the products and the product provider.

43
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.380
In the products for writer.

44
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.000
For that.

45
00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.390
We are simply fetching all those products we have and where the database that is the description, the

46
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:09.270
I.D., the immeasurable, the prize, the products category name quantity title and hold us.

47
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.460
So if you already know how to do this.

48
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.520
You already know how to apply the cadets.

49
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.120
So you you're not to enable users to do okay now since they're not to do this, if you have forgotten

50
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.590
not to do this, you can basically try to go back to the lectures because definitely you're going to

51
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.150
forget all this.

52
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.950
So you can most of the time try to repeat it in enough ways to master you.

53
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.280
Okay.

54
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.950
So what we can then do now is to log into our accounts.

55
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:47.220
I think a lot of the accounts associated with this email address and the password is embassy and login.

56
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.990
Okay.

57
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.530
Okay.

58
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.590
Now we are logged in, so all we can do is have the code over here.

59
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.990
That is the applaud page design code so we can use contra and E to our lights and control and see.

60
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.280
Then over to hope, Lord.

61
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.440
Now, you don't really need to follow this lecture.

62
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.220
You can easily just create your own design for each upload for the upload screen.

63
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.670
Sorry.

64
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.590
So you can basically just create your own design the contrary and e to a light and delete them pieces.

65
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.980
Okay.

66
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.520
So what we can then do is you set up this.

67
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.820
I think I called it something else.

68
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.300
I called it upload.

69
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.020
Upload farm, upload product.

70
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.600
So both product from and common.

71
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.770
Comar.

72
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.660
I think so.

73
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.740
Okay.

74
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.940
Yes.

75
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.710
You and associates and.

76
00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.190
And and and and and upload.

77
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.910
Okay.

78
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.010
I think we need so hard to start this.

79
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.270
Art we start.

80
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.250
Okay.

81
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.700
Okay.

82
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.090
Okay.

83
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.510
Okay.

84
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.960
Okay.

85
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.710
Okay, okay.

86
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.160
Okay.

87
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.030
Okay.

88
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.690
Let's go.

89
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.260
And.

90
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.080
It's going to take us back to the home screen.

91
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.610
Okay.

92
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.170
And you can see the via.

93
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.610
Now that I think you're right not to remove rights.

94
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.070
If you don, you can let me know.

95
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.430
So I'm going to get to that.

96
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.960
Okay.

97
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.090
Now, via this is the product type.

98
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.970
So we can just go back to the production field.

99
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.010
You can see it's basically the same thing with what we have in the registration page.

100
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.520
Okay.

101
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.990
Over here.

102
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.260
You can see the first the first test field is.

103
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.810
Okay.

104
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.390
The first test fields.

105
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.230
Is it time to exit test?

106
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.570
You decided not to do this.

107
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.690
And the keyboard type?

108
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.140
I can just change this too.

109
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.360
This should be tests.

110
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.370
Oh, I think we have something like that.

111
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.650
Yeah.

112
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.080
It's email address.

113
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.680
And.

114
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.450
The labor test is productive too.

115
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.830
You can also see this as a place where you can see the value.

116
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.600
Okay.

117
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.520
So it is not place order.

118
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.960
Okay.

119
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.580
So you can see what doors?

120
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.460
Okay.

121
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.190
And.

122
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.400
We have the prize.

123
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.920
You can also see the test field and why we are seeing the keyboard type should be a number so you can

124
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.700
click on this.

125
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.070
Nobody's going to pop up.

126
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.450
Okay.

127
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.170
Okay then over here we have the functionality.

128
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.820
That's the peak image that you can see.

129
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.240
This is a very long code because we did not make it reusable after I didn't use that one, which we

130
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.870
already have.

131
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.600
So I just created this from scratch again so you can see how they make this reusable.

132
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.730
So that's why we have separate function for image from camera and the image from gallery you can see

133
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.160
so you can as well rename this to.

134
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.700
Peak.

135
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.290
Image.

136
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.770
Okay.

137
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.910
They can see this is basically it's.

138
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.220
Right.

139
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.720
So nine adults who grabbed the imputes of.

140
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:30.070
The user was you can add security not to do that right now to grab it is to create a controller so you

141
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.960
can just do this.

142
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.570
Okay.

143
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.190
Well, there.

144
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.640
Right.

145
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.600
Well, they're just going to be fine and it's going to be a type of test.

146
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.320
And it's in.

147
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.070
Test it.

148
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:50.470
It's a controller and on this car you can see products tie to.

149
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.840
And it's going to be quite a test and the in.

150
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.760
And it sent comptroller.

151
00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.550
Test it.

152
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.200
It's in controller and.

153
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.120
Okay.

154
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.650
Now.

155
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.920
Go back to the product title and over here.

156
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.860
Controller writes in addition this so we're not clear behavior but controller.

157
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.480
Controller.

158
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.020
Controller on the score product towards tie two.

159
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.580
So it isn't the grab the tie to.

160
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.090
The value of what the user.

161
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.539
Think according to the title.

162
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:36.780
Controller.

163
00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.169
Okay.

164
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.760
So what did we just call this?

165
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.860
Q What's the became?

166
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.700
Okay.

167
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.680
Types of.

168
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.650
Controller.

169
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.650
Okay, great.

170
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.200
Now, this is going to give us a sort.

171
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.090
The value.

172
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.290
The value of.

173
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.900
So probably we can say the tie to is so.

174
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.700
The title is.

175
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.740
I'm going to be for my keyboard.

176
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.390
The title is Gucci.

177
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.930
Of our size, right?

178
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.500
And the price is.

179
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.150
40.

180
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.560
Okay.

181
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:25.640
Right.

182
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.010
And you can pick image from gallery.

183
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.660
We already created the function.

184
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.860
You can see.

185
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.120
And I think you're heading out to the streets.

186
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.450
Right.

187
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:34.840
Okay.

188
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.090
So for the category, you can see fonts.

189
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:43.390
You're going to need to make sure it is the same ten you have and the discussion you can just type the

190
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:43.750
lots.

191
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.000
We also have you also need to attach a controller to this discussion in order to grab the value.

192
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.330
Right.

193
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.110
And the value we can go ahead and specify the quantity.

194
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.250
So this is basically it.

195
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.320
And over here we have the upload.

196
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.920
Okay.

197
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:04.480
So nice try to see if you can use the experience you have in creating the registration page.

198
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.330
To see if you can use that same knowledge for this.

199
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.380
Definitely.

200
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.540
You're not going to be able to do this fully or so.

201
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:17.930
You might estimate you might not be able to do this fully, but at least try your best to see if you

202
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.010
can use the same knowledge.

203
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.190
Or probably you might not go with this design.

204
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.890
You can just see if you can create your own design.

205
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.610
Probably you can just have full feel.

206
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:35.810
Sorry, you can just have all this fields and see if you can upload it to the products collection the

207
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.180
same way you did for this.

208
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.610
So what you can do is you can create another fi, just this thing where you have the whole controller

209
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.140
fire to see if you can try to save.

210
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.990
All these details of the products.

211
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:58.140
Collection in the case of would be assignments was try to see if you can do it or not, but you just

212
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.010
have to try your best.

213
00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.940
Definitely.

214
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.440
I'm going to show you this again.

215
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.630
Right.

216
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.060
Okay.

217
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.750
Okay, guys.

218
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.890
See you in the next lecture.
