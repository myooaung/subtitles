00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.990
Hi.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.859
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
In this lecture, we're going to create this search controller.

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay.

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.720
Now, in order to do this, we need to head up to the controller surgery.

6
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.060
But before then, we need to go to this, which is our tree and the circle animation.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.760
And what we can do is we can get rid of this controller to dispose of trying to see, to copy and then

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.150
delete.

9
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.150
And we're going to paste this over here.

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.120
This is going to save us from future crashes.

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.510
Okay.

12
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.150
So now we can use controller and se to save.

13
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.570
Okay.

14
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.810
So now we can then head back to the control surgery and over the control directory.

15
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.950
We can then create a new file and we can call this file.

16
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.200
Search on the square.

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.710
Controller and this section wish, you know, dot, dot.

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.660
Okay.

19
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.780
And now we can use controller and bits.

20
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.460
Make this way.

21
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.390
And I see.

22
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.820
Now, your first step is to create a class.

23
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.800
And as well, we can call this class search controller.

24
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.360
Okay, great.

25
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.040
Now, what we're going to be doing is going to be similar to what we have over here.

26
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.760
You can see that we are simply fetching the posted comments.

27
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.450
Right.

28
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.560
And over here, we are simply fetching the uploaded video.

29
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.350
Right.

30
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.860
So what we're going to be doing is going to be similar.

31
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.820
So all this but this time around, regular fetch the user based on the name.

32
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay.

33
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.890
So you know that to do this, we need to head back to the controllers, actually, and then the search

34
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.480
controller.

35
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.090
And now we can use controller and read something this way.

36
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.200
Okay.

37
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.230
Now, over here, we are going to use this which you've seen before so we can say finer and s.

38
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.790
And.

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.810
We can specify it is a type of list.

40
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.430
Right.

41
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.250
And okay, there's going to be a list of what's the user model?

42
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.180
Because they're going to be searching for users.

43
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.430
Right?

44
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.790
Okay.

45
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.230
User.

46
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.070
User model and then we can have this and how this.

47
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.850
Okay, what we need to do is a light is control and dots and we're gonna import from the.

48
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.660
Gets.

49
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.650
Slash gets.

50
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.150
And over here.

51
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.080
This car.

52
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.800
Sorry.

53
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.160
And use control and dots.

54
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.540
And we're going to be important from the user models.

55
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.980
Okay.

56
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.450
So now we can create a rainbow.

57
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.980
We can see on the square and we can call this test, use this, and it's going to be equal to this.

58
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.790
You've seen this before.

59
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.340
Okay.

60
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.040
Now we need this and make this empty.

61
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.840
Okay.

62
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.840
How this semicolon.

63
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.290
Okay.

64
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.180
Now you can see where we created the rainbow card by this closest uses.

65
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.050
Right?

66
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.530
And this is for now, the user is going to be empty.

67
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.090
Okay.

68
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.080
And as you know, this is a private rainbow.

69
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.170
And because it is a private variable, we cannot access is variable outside this fi.

70
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.360
So what we need to do is to create a guitar in that to be able to access this variable.

71
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.950
So to do that really is this wish you sent before so we can as well specify it is a type of least least

72
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.880
of user.

73
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.220
Right.

74
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.550
And now we can see it gets.

75
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.460
And now we can create a normal private variable.

76
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.070
I say search use it says uses that you can see now you're not using the underscore okay.

77
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.420
And our function and now we can call this test.

78
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.120
Users and want to assess the value.

79
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.940
Okay.

80
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.190
I just semicolon.

81
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.150
Okay, great.

82
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:52.150
And now we can then create a function and we can call this function search user.

83
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.960
Over here, we're going to pass in a dynamic variable, which we are going to call our search.

84
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.480
Test.

85
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.080
Okay.

86
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.000
Now the first test is referring.

87
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.690
To what?

88
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.620
The user is going to pass in over a year.

89
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.460
Okay.

90
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:18.589
So it is a passing F, this s this is simply referring to that F if the user passed passing and the

91
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.019
assessed.

92
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.220
This is simply referring to that hammerhead.

93
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.650
Okay, great.

94
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.960
And as you know, this is a test.

95
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.260
So you can specify it is a data type of what?

96
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.250
String.

97
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.520
Okay.

98
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.510
Now we're going to be using your.

99
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.060
And in order to use our aid we need to have the essential via.

100
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.380
And now all we can do is we can car.

101
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.050
Is this car smashed?

102
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.490
Says users.

103
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.720
Right.

104
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.230
And now we're going to use this, which you've also seen before.

105
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.480
Darts bind.

106
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.070
So is this dodge bind.

107
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.340
It's going to be a bind.

108
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.770
Look at what we can do is we can just copy this and make sure we don't have in a spending mistake and

109
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.490
get rid of this business and say, do it.

110
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.650
Mainstream.

111
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.290
Now this is going to be what?

112
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.040
Fire.

113
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.260
Whereas, sir.

114
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.290
The word, we need to import it as well.

115
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.200
Well before then can just go ahead and say collection.

116
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.180
Over here, we can add lights and use control and dots.

117
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.580
Okay.

118
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.220
Okay.

119
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.210
Well, before then.

120
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.000
We are going to be fetching users, right?

121
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.340
So this is going to be the user's collection.

122
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.680
Import.

123
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.800
Okay.

124
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.270
Okay.

125
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.340
Okay.

126
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.540
Is it away from the coast?

127
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.220
Okay.

128
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.990
The official news is right.

129
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.740
So this is going to be the users collection.

130
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.320
So you can say use this collection and now you're going to use this, which you've not seen before.

131
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.280
That is that part where you can see is asking for the field and we're going to be searching for users

132
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.840
based on their name.

133
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.950
Right.

134
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.440
You can see we have this name field over here.

135
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.230
Okay.

136
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.260
And now we can had a camera and we can say is equal to you can see we have this is equal to we have

137
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.860
is greater than we have is greater than or equal to we have is lesser than we have is less than or equal

138
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.640
to we have is not equal to we have is not okay.

139
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.820
Now, the difference between this is equal to and this is not equal to is.

140
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.630
If we are using this as equity.

141
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.550
It means we have to type in the hazards, the hazard name we have.

142
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.270
You can see over here we have Mac right in nine, another search for this user called Mac.

143
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.340
We need to type.

144
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.250
Is that says Wyatt.

145
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.130
That is Mac.

146
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.970
Okay.

147
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.100
That is what that equates to does.

148
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.890
So this have to match with what?

149
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.500
The search test after match with what?

150
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.020
We have no database boards.

151
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.330
If we are using this is.

152
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.090
Is this were.

153
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.880
Is greater than or equal to.

154
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.870
We don't really need too much.

155
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.920
It's.

156
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.250
That is by tapping the letter hand.

157
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.930
And since we have.

158
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.320
Ay ay ay ay later.

159
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:49.870
And it's our home our database is going to fetch all the user that's have or that has similar later

160
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.650
that is hey.

161
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:57.130
So that's what that's that is the main difference within that is equal to or greater than on this because

162
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.360
it does so with my on you can choose of which you want to go.

163
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.390
It's for the now we can go with is equal to.

164
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.640
Okay.

165
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.870
Is equal to what?

166
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.340
Okay.

167
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.060
This test.

168
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.620
Okay.

169
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.150
Grids now are.

170
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.340
Yeah, you can see we have this.

171
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.530
Name code.

172
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.400
So in order for us to face that mark, we need to type in.

173
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.260
He has that name of our record.

174
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.620
Mark.

175
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:26.680
Right.

176
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.090
Okay.

177
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.510
So by typing, this is not bringing out this user.

178
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:30.990
Okay.

179
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.880
Both my Spanish and UK visit beaches of which you want to follow.

180
00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:36.960
Okay.

181
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.270
So I think.

182
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.150
In India is right.

183
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.630
Okay.

184
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.919
And now we can say dots.

185
00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.410
The snapshot.

186
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:47.880
And.

187
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.920
For if.

188
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.170
Okay, now, if we have multiple.

189
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.210
If we have multiple.

190
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.040
Name with the same mark.

191
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.050
What we want to do is we want to fetch all those users that has similarly named.

192
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.370
Right.

193
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.740
Okay.

194
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.300
So because of that ribbon, they need to look over each mark we have.

195
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.000
So for that, we need to say dots.

196
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.800
That map.

197
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:15.970
Okay.

198
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.420
Then the whole point is to see, okay, sorry, I think I'm out of into the K.

199
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.210
Sorry for that.

200
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.000
And now we can get rid of this.

201
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:27.970
And.

202
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:29.920
So.

203
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.030
Okay.

204
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.360
Is on to this.

205
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.010
Okay.

206
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.980
Get rid of this.

207
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.800
And great.

208
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:43.630
And now we can had a recall over there and is asking for the events.

209
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.980
Okay.

210
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:50.330
This is going to be a snapshot because when we have a user with the same name, we'll definitely go

211
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.560
fetch all those users.

212
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:51.890
Right.

213
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.750
And since Rod's in there with multiple users, it is known as Query Snapshot.

214
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.800
Right?

215
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.320
Instead of query snapshot, we can get rid of the snapshot.

216
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.700
And to just query.

217
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:02.810
Okay.

218
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.280
Now the first step is to what's.

219
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.460
Is to create an emptiness.

220
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.090
Which is going to be a type of user as well.

221
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.120
And we can call this return value.

222
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.730
We can just see.

223
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.650
Well, for the short form of return value.

224
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.430
And we can.

225
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.290
Make this empty.

226
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.970
Okay, great.

227
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.000
Now we need to look over each user.

228
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.670
We are searching for that has similar name.

229
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:30.790
Right.

230
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.060
Okay.

231
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.280
So we can't say for.

232
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.280
For variable.

233
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.610
We can just see elements or you can see elm.

234
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.630
Okay.

235
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.390
Lemons.

236
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.190
Can you spell it in full?

237
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.360
And we can then say for the elements in.

238
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.870
And query.

239
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.490
Dart.

240
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.250
No talks, right?

241
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.580
Okay.

242
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.920
Okay.

243
00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.980
No docs.

244
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.370
So add us to this.

245
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.270
Okay.

246
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:14.450
Then we once had to this list using all this before we turned while you dodge hot.

247
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.880
Right and now we can see a user that from.

248
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.330
Perhaps not.

249
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.080
Okay.

250
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.010
Okay.

251
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.300
Now, instead of this snap, this is going to be the elements.

252
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.350
Okay.

253
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.190
Okay.

254
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.690
This is basically ads and.

255
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.440
Finally.

256
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.250
Over a year.

257
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.410
When incidents return.

258
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:44.980
Right.

259
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.730
Well, okay.

260
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.610
And now we need to had the semicolon.

261
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.430
Okay.

262
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360
And over here.

263
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.100
Listen to this.

264
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.450
And then you can see where it's saying this type of variable.

265
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.610
It is what a document snapshot.

266
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:00.970
Right.

267
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.420
Okay.

268
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:09.460
Now, over here, it is a quick snapshot because we have access to all these that has similarly named

269
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.170
Card Mac.

270
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:10.760
Right.

271
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.170
Okay.

272
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.960
And over here you can see we are looping over each document.

273
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:22.500
And since we are looping over these documents, this is going to be seen as each document or each user

274
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.090
or each mark writes and will reference each document.

275
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.610
It is known as what's document snapshots.

276
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:36.260
So that's why that's why Hawaii is seeing it as what's a single document, because we have already run

277
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.230
a loop in that to break it down into pieces or potstickers.

278
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:40.680
Okay.

279
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.500
So that is the reason it is saying this element is a type of what's a document snapshot.

280
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.660
But over here it is a type of query snapshot because we still have multiple uses.

281
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.200
Okay.

282
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:58.350
So this is basically it's you've seen all this before and you can see all this is similar to what we

283
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.460
have in the comments controller and the.

284
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.650
Video controller.

285
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.350
The only difference is we are using the compiled query.

286
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.490
That is this dot.

287
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.670
Where is the search test?

288
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:17.910
I remember this test as is simply referring to the value the user is going, the type of value as currently

289
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.540
it is.

290
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.050
Mark Right.

291
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:26.280
So the search test is referring to what this mark unrest in ways is to the name.

292
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.260
And remember, this name is the field we have in the.

293
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.260
In our cloud faster database.

294
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.610
Okay.

295
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.490
And it is Mac.

296
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.530
So since it is equal to this Mac, it is definitely going to bring out that user.

297
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:42.340
Okay.

298
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.030
Okay.

299
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.220
So now in this lecture, we are finally going to display that first user.

300
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.830
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
