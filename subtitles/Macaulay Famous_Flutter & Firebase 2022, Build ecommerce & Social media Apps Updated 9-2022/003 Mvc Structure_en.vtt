Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.810
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.350
In the last lecture, we created the Flutter project, and what we simply did was to open the creative

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.180
project on via Xcode.

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.750
And this is the default app flutter created for us.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.260
Now in this lecture we're going to start building our app.

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:24.690
One of the ways we are going to be using to structure our files is known as V C, which stands for modules

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.560
views controllers over the sleep dietary.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.590
We are going to create a new folder that is the M and which stands for models.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.130
The models are three is we are going to be creating all our fields such as the username field, the

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.410
first name field, the last name field, the image field and so on.

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.340
And as well over this leaf directory, we're going to need to create a new folder that says the V and

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.140
V stands for Views.

14
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.680
The views directory is where we're going to be creating all our screens, such as the login screen,

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.570
the sign up screen, the profile screen, the dashboard screen and so on.

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.500
And lastly, over the slave directory, we're going to need to create a new folder that is the C and

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.570
which stands for controllers.

18
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.710
The Comptroller surgery is where we're going to be creating all our logics, such as logic to sign up

19
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.880
users, logic to sign us users and so hard.
