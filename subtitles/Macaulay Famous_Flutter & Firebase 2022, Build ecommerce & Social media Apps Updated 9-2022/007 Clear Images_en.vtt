00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.780
All right, welcome.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.730
In this lecture, we are going to enable users.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.300
So users are going to be able to click on any of these images in order to delete that.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.980
Okay.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.490
Now, to do this, what we simply have to do is to wrap this list, view the user with a button.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.190
So who I we need to alight and use control and dots and wrap with widgets.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.360
And of course, as you know, we have a lot of button, we have the gesture detector and also we do

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.990
have the inkwell and some lots more.

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
So what we can just do, we can wrap this with an equal.

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.910
Ink.

11
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.450
Well, and of course, the inkwell has a property like the home tab.

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.840
Okay.

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:01:00.100
And now what we have to do is we need to update the UI because whenever a user tap on this, we want

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.050
to get rid of this image.

15
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.310
And since is going to be no, we then want to share the test.

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.850
Right.

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.080
You can see over here we said if the image list is not equal to no, then only we want to display the

18
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.890
images.

19
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:24.310
But if it is equal to no, we then want to show this test which says you have not picked any images

20
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.970
yet.

21
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.760
Right.

22
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.400
Okay.

23
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.610
And in order to update the UI, we have to use a property which is known as set state.

24
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.160
Said State, and you can see why.

25
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.770
What we simply did was to create a variable called image list and for the now we give it no value,

26
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.070
just an empty list.

27
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.660
Right.

28
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.800
And over here we created a variable called Pict images.

29
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.540
And this image is variable has access to all the images we are going to pick.

30
00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.990
Right?

31
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.700
And over here we are set in state and calling the global variable called image list and giving it this

32
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.530
value called images.

33
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.940
Right.

34
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.520
Okay.

35
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.430
So we tend to state over here.

36
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.140
We can then say image.

37
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.940
Least.

38
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.490
Because all our images is in this rebel, right?

39
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.630
We can then say image.

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.520
This is equal to no.

41
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.680
I think I talk too much.

42
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.310
Okay.

43
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.320
Use control, hand save and let's check this out.

44
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.650
Okay.

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.430
And now I'm going to click on this.

46
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.830
You can see you have not.

47
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.360
Pete and images.

48
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.480
Look, I'm just gonna look like I said.

49
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.600
We have to press the left click down, and now we can.

50
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.360
Okay, let's click down.

51
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.670
And now we can take multiple images.

52
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.890
And I think I choose the the horizontal shape this way.

53
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.690
Right.

54
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.280
And click on this.

55
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.780
Okay.

56
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.630
Seems good.

57
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.440
You have not picked any image for the list view.

58
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.650
I'm just going to get rid of this.

59
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.890
I prefer the vertical form.

60
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.290
Okay.

61
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.620
I think the vertical form is okay for me.

62
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.290
I'm just going to pick this one more time.

63
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.720
Okay.

64
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.600
Peak.

65
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.560
Okay.

66
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.210
I think I prefer this.

67
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.780
Okay.

68
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.630
I'm just going to play.

69
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.400
Okay.

70
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.660
Okay, guys.

71
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.880
See you in the next lecture.
