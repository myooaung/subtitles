00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.060
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.530
Walker and I knew click on the harpsichord button.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.160
It's going to hide the item.

4
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.900
So the cuts.

5
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.900
So now in this lecture, regular display, those added item.

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.360
Okay, not to do this, we're gonna need to go back to our visit code.

7
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.380
And first of all, we're going to go to the cuts screen.

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.900
Okay.

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.240
Great.

10
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.720
Now what we're going to first do is we're going to need access to this.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.200
Get cuts, I tell him, and you know that I says this gets cuts.

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.720
I tell him we need to, first of all, assess this cuts, provide that class.

13
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.290
Okay, not to do this.

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.830
We're going to go back to the cuts screen.

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.090
Okay.

16
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.240
Now we can use culture and be.

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.890
Okay.

18
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.320
Well, there we're going to create a finer variable.

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.220
We can call this on the score cards provider raising the on the score because they want to make this

20
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.950
variable private so that we are not going to be able to call this variable aside this fine.

21
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.400
Okay.

22
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.000
Everything is equal to the provider.

23
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.800
Then the case.

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.960
You can alights and use controlled darting at airports.

25
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.450
Then thoughts of contest.

26
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.840
Okay.

27
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.220
Add your semicolon and we're going to call the cots provider class.

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.870
Okay, great.

29
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.330
Now, instead of this item counts, we can call cuts.

30
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.930
And it's this and this string together.

31
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380
Okay, so you can use this and how to dollar sign.

32
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.380
And then what the scorecards provider.

33
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.190
Dirt gets it in there, not lent.

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.550
This is going to give us how many items we have added to our carts.

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.750
Okay.

36
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.540
Now we can use control and save.

37
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.220
Okay.

38
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.920
Okay.

39
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.480
Now go check it out.

40
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.680
Go back and go to the cuts.

41
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.340
Okay.

42
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.500
Because we have on the cuts, I think.

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.810
Right.

44
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.130
Okay.

45
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.450
Now, instead of this, Terry, we're going to get rid of this and call the cuts provider.

46
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.960
Dirt gets cut by ten dirt lint.

47
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.130
Right.

48
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.440
Okay.

49
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.790
Okay.

50
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.050
Now this control.

51
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.480
And is.

52
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.650
Contrariness.

53
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.890
Okay.

54
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.170
So contrariness.

55
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.790
The key.

56
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.560
I think the committee is going to delete and.

57
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.330
Say that gets okay.

58
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.010
Cause I tell the client.

59
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.400
Now control and excessive.

60
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.920
You're going to see one.

61
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.280
Okay.

62
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.840
Now let's go back to the fields and then how this.

63
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.150
Hearts of cards.

64
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.730
Okay.

65
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.850
You're going to see two now.

66
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.240
Right.

67
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.590
Okay.

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.720
And that's what we have to not in this thing we're going to do is we're going to display the item.

69
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.100
Okay.
