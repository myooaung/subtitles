00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.610
Guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.200
Walker In this lecture, we're going to set up the configurations for the Jersey Nets.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.640
Okay.

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.300
Now, to do this, we're going to need to scroll down.

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.100
Okay.

6
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.940
400.

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.670
Now, we're going to need to copy this slide first.

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.720
Then you're going to need to go back to Our Vinci Code.

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.710
Then the project level view the corridor.

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.000
This.

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.780
Okay.

12
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.259
Now you're going to get rid of this reduction over here.

13
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.870
Get rid of this and then build this.

14
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.720
Then use control and this to save.

15
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.410
Okay.

16
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.340
Now they're also going to scroll down.

17
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.220
Okay.

18
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.750
I will skip this part.

19
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.910
Okay, let's cut down.

20
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.380
Now, over here.

21
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.330
The Android.

22
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.210
My first thought, sml.

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.380
Yes.

24
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.700
Submit as a k Andre by the first SML will conflict with your project, namely the project application

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.890
labor fields to control that.

26
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.080
Okay, so counter that.

27
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.680
Go to and read source main and read by the first to disassemble.

28
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.100
Okay.

29
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.600
So they're going to go to court trying to make this law.

30
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.830
We're going to go to.

31
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.820
Android.

32
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.920
Right.

33
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.810
I saw source.

34
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.930
Then men.

35
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.540
Okay.

36
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.520
This should be it, right?

37
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.910
Okay.

38
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.250
Now, let's see what is asking us to do.

39
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.090
Okay.

40
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.400
Is asking us to.

41
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.380
Copy this.

42
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.590
You can set it to replace a relay bell.

43
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.940
Okay.

44
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.330
First of all, I just got a copy that it wants us to address as well.

45
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.100
So we're going to copy this.

46
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.910
Okay.

47
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.000
Great way to make this white.

48
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.660
Okay.

49
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.050
But you're going to get rid of this get rid of that greater than they're going to face this year.

50
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.340
You can see we still do agree to that.

51
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.750
Okay.

52
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.260
Now.

53
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.550
Then this is this.

54
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.140
You're going to need to copy this.

55
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.820
Okay.

56
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.250
Then is this?

57
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.250
Okay.

58
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.250
Okay.

59
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.570
Now he's going to try to satisfy.

60
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.360
Okay, great.

61
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.260
We're going to go back.

62
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.690
Okay.

63
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.610
Now says we should increase the minimize decay to 23.

64
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.070
And that was the reason I said there is no good documentation for this.

65
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.160
If we should reduce, it's increased.

66
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.300
It's 23 is still not going to work.

67
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.680
So we're going to increase us to 24 instead of 28 are going to increase our 2 hours to 29.

68
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.100
Okay.

69
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.470
Now to do this problem, they need to go to solve of did this problem need to go to the upgrade?

70
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.500
You did great.

71
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.300
All right.

72
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.460
So contrary to me, this war that we're going to go to, I dread.

73
00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.720
Right.

74
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.780
You're going to collapse this.

75
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.400
They're going to go to 100.

76
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.420
Hop and view that grid.

77
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.810
Right.

78
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.220
Okay.

79
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.070
Now for the target as the question.

80
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.130
They're going to get rid of this and use 29 and not 28.

81
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.480
And for this, Robin, they use 24 and not 23.

82
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.870
Okay.

83
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.560
Now we can use control and that's to save.

84
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.670
Right.

85
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.630
Okay.

86
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.760
Okay.

87
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.520
Now, over here, you can see two months or so of this program.

88
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.550
So you can see it's as decay and it was programmed.

89
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.990
But without a program to fly dots through that profile, your route is impeccable.

90
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.200
Well, we may send the voter up, as well as the rattlesnakes you caught in your photo project and read

91
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.130
how.

92
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.210
We'd agreed to add this.

93
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.590
Okay.

94
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.950
So we're going to need to had.

95
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.290
This.

96
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.150
Two lines you can see are below two lines for prayagraj.

97
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.760
The governor had this.

98
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.280
Okay.

99
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.940
Got it.

100
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.300
This.

101
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.160
Okay.

102
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.150
Copy this.

103
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.480
I'm just gonna copy everything, including that, and I'm going to get rid of it.

104
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.310
Okay.

105
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.730
Can I see if I can?

106
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.800
Can I just get a copy of it then?

107
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.260
Okay.

108
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.370
I think we need to go to air.

109
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.560
Okay.

110
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.700
I'll play.

111
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.180
All right.

112
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.570
Okay.

113
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.240
I think, as I said, Tunisia, then the beautiful sites.

114
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.200
Okay, so we're just going to take this and I going to get rid of this, too, right?

115
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.590
Okay.

116
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.050
And now we can use control this to see.

117
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.540
I'm just going to get it to the same line.

118
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.740
Okay.

119
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.940
Great.

120
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.360
Control necessary and go back to our brother.

121
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.250
Okay.

122
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.970
Now, the next thing we're going to do, and I take it is not.

123
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.170
We can't find this here.

124
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.740
Okay, I just got the check.

125
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.930
Okay, so you can see that art improv den had a fire in the same directory called Forgot Rules.

126
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.810
Okay, now, if we should click on this.

127
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.730
You're going to take us to an empty page.

128
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.280
I'm having this network issues, but it's gonna take us to an empty stage.

129
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.910
So that was.

130
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:36.380
I said we don't have they don't really have a lot of good documentation and we don't really have a lot

131
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.840
of good documentation for this.

132
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.240
Okay.

133
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.230
So now what we can do is you can see it was just to create.

134
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.020
It's gonna make sure my data is done on.

135
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.910
Okay, so what is basically saying is we.

136
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.010
We?

137
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.360
We need to create a high court.

138
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.650
Cruel God.

139
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.980
Who's going to see if I can copy this name so I don't make a mistake?

140
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.000
Aquarius will go back to that.

141
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.890
Think we have something like that?

142
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.220
Okay.

143
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.590
It is a delay, so we don't make a mistake.

144
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.790
And then we defy.

145
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.050
I can't throw a grudge.

146
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.020
Okay, so from this.

147
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.890
Right.

148
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.280
Okay.

149
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.730
Now you're going to see an empty page here.

150
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.400
Right.

151
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.780
Okay.

152
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.950
Hopefully you've seen that.

153
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.090
Okay.

154
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.250
Now is asking us to set then how to fight in the same territory called progress.

155
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.520
Said to progress.

156
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.900
Okay.

157
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.120
Now we're going to go back to our Ondrej.

158
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.460
So he not arrested you but bicycled back over this territory?

159
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.260
We're going to create a new high.

160
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.850
Quite this.

161
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.020
Okay.

162
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.840
Then the rules.

163
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.810
In my test.

164
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.540
Not already.

165
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.430
How it's all work.

166
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.860
It is it is going to be available for you in the GitHub code.

167
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.160
When you want to copy digital copy the code, you're going to see this code in digital.

168
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.950
In my GitHub, I can say, okay, we're going to see the copy then.

169
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.250
We need to test this.

170
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.590
Right.

171
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.730
Okay, then the next thing we're going to do is revenue is control.

172
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.560
And that's not to say this say, okay, this is just basically rules you don't have to transmit.

173
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.000
So memorize it.

174
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.610
It is just basically rules.

175
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.950
Right.

176
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.480
And then maybe we'll do a whole we need to type this out.

177
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.590
But really, it is just rules.

178
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.460
It's okay.

179
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.300
Great.

180
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.330
Okay.

181
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.490
So this is basically the basically whole the configurations we we need to use jets emit.

182
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:46.950
Okay.

183
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:54.940
Now what you're going to need to do is to close this code and restart again awkwardly.

184
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.960
You might get an arrow you can do to let me know.

185
00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.880
Or probably we might get an arrow.

186
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.800
Then you're going to show that in this lecture or hopefully this rolls, we touch an arrow.

187
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:12.450
So what you're going to do now is to close your code and then open it again.

188
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.950
There you go.

189
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.330
You need to go to the.

190
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.430
You're going to need to go now to the cave just below collapsed this first that you're going to need

191
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.830
to go back to the way they call the site.

192
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.330
Okay.

193
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.380
Leave dietary.

194
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.500
Okay.

195
00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:40.090
Hopefully they're not going to collapse this okay live territory then demand it that far and then run

196
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:40.539
your hop.

197
00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:40.940
Okay.

198
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.700
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
