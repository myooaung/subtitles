00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.310
Now, what we just did is known as dependency injection.

4
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.820
But in this lecture, we're going to make our code more concise.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.490
The head of See your cat's item screen.

6
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.200
You're going to see.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.900
We have created up to five variables.

8
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.330
Right.

9
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.680
Okay.

10
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.820
Now head up to your model statutory and then your cat's attributes.

11
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.380
Hi.

12
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.840
You're going to see we have similar variables already, right?

13
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.890
So there's really no need for these variables over the items create.

14
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.300
Okay.

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.490
So now we're going to get rid of all this.

16
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.220
And that's what we're going to need to get rid of the constructor.

17
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.210
Okay.

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.120
Now you're going to go to the courts.

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.940
Screen culture and be as well.

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.170
Going to need to get read.

21
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.210
Oh, this.

22
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.960
Gets rid.

23
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.230
Of this as well.

24
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.440
Okay.

25
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.030
Great.

26
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.570
Okay.

27
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.260
No.

28
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.230
Okay.

29
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.610
We can't just escort you unnecessary.

30
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.980
Okay.

31
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.680
Now, already Cox item.

32
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.820
We are going to use the cots model attributes.

33
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.110
Okay.

34
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.050
We're going to use this.

35
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.560
Data.

36
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.100
Okay.

37
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.050
Lots of others did this.

38
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.600
We are going to go back to the cards.

39
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.160
Screen.

40
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.730
Sorry, the cards.

41
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.540
I have screen.

42
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.930
Okay.

43
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.790
Right then.

44
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.120
Over here, we're going to create a final variable.

45
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.250
It's going to be called on the scorecards.

46
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.620
Attribute.

47
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.330
Okay.

48
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.930
It's going to be equal to provide provider.

49
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.810
Provide.

50
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.490
The arts.

51
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.950
Okay.

52
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.760
We can alight and use controlled darts in pots.

53
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.440
Is going to be darts.

54
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.199
Lots of contests.

55
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.400
We can pass the cuts attributes.

56
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.750
Okay, great.

57
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.380
Okay.

58
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.300
I'll click on this first.

59
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.960
This is all this is going to be on the scorecards.

60
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.230
Etc..

61
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.420
Does the material.

62
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.470
Click on this.

63
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.160
On the scorecards achievement.

64
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.680
But I think it is tighter and tighter because this era.

65
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.180
This kid is going to be on the scorecards, actually, but.

66
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.850
Archibald Prize.

67
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.450
Okay.

68
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.110
Finally.

69
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.000
It's going to be on the scorecards afterwards.

70
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.430
Dirt, quantity.

71
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.850
Okay.

72
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.170
Nice control.

73
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.830
Necessary.

74
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.070
Now you're going to have an error.

75
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.890
Okay.

76
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.630
I see.

77
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.180
Because we need to wrap this with the change, not a fire.

78
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.160
So we're going to go back to the.

79
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.550
Cuts.

80
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.350
Cut screen.

81
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.390
Cards.

82
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.380
Okay.

83
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.120
Okay.

84
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.220
Now.

85
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.360
Okay.

86
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.770
We are we are using this okay to air regular light and use control.

87
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.320
And that's what we did.

88
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.780
We just going to change, not see the fire.

89
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.180
That's if I provide that value.

90
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.560
Okay.

91
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.310
But we can reduce it in this time and there's going to be value.

92
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.120
Okay.

93
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.900
For the value, there's going to be a.

94
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.100
On the scorecard provider, then dot gets cut item.

95
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.579
Then to add value, we also need to convert this to lists and.

96
00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.890
This is going to be intense to assess each item.

97
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.060
What can I use?

98
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.960
Control necessary.

99
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.790
Okay.

100
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.410
Great, Sims.

101
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.620
Good.

102
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.980
Right.

103
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.860
Our code is now concise.

104
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.280
Now, if we don't see you understand, you can then let me know.

105
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.060
Okay.

106
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.290
I'll try this.

107
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.940
Okay, great.

108
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.080
Okay, guys.

109
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.270
See you in the next lecture.
