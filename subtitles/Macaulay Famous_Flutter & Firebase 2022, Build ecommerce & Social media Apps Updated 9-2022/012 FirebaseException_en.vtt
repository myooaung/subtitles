00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.960
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.640
In this lecture, we're going to talk about sultans.

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.930
First of all, we are going to talk about Firebase or Inception, and we are going to create the loaded

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.580
spinner.

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.150
Okay.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.890
To do this, we have to go to our seller log screen.

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.110
But before then, I'm going to show you this.

9
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.040
Remember we said if the error is order from this, we then want to return this log bear, which is going

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.480
to say something went wrong.

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.790
Okay, now what we're going to do is over the sellers sign in.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.440
We can just type a an email address which does not exist.

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.800
I can say test at Gmail.

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.760
That's com.

15
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.990
And for password, just type something gibberish and click on.

16
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.070
Just going to get rid of this first and click on log in.

17
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.630
Log in.

18
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.150
Okay.

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.460
I think click on login.

20
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.040
Okay.

21
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.490
You can see something went wrong, but the issue is the user won't be able to know what actually went

22
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.060
wrong.

23
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.290
So to make this a bit more cleaner or to make this a bit more informative to that user, that, hey,

24
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.360
this was what happened.

25
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.390
To do that before the catch block.

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.080
We have a property known as on Firebase Hard's exception.

27
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.170
Okay.

28
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.660
And instead of saying something went wrong, we are.

29
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.090
I'm going to get rid of this and use the e dot.

30
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.230
E dot.

31
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.790
Code.

32
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.600
Okay.

33
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.210
The E basically is referring to error.

34
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.780
And I think also you have to remove this from your code.

35
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.770
Head up to this next number.

36
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.830
You can see why raising the snack bar.

37
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.050
And we created it over here within the controllers territory.

38
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.250
And what I basically just did, I get I got rid of this string, right.

39
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.740
To say it can be anything.

40
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.270
It can also be a number.

41
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.110
Or probably you can just use the string and see if there will be an issue.

42
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.920
Okay.

43
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.490
No issue.

44
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.110
This is good.

45
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.770
Okay, this is good.

46
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.510
Okay.

47
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.440
And now we can then try this out.

48
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.030
Click on this again.

49
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.710
Like you can see user notes found.

50
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.010
I think this is a bit clear.

51
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.670
Okay.

52
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.230
And now we are going to create the load spinner back to the seller login screen and.

53
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.080
The first step is to create a variable which is going to be a type of bull because it is a true a false

54
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.880
value and.

55
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.140
We can call this as London.

56
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.850
Is equal to force defaults.

57
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.320
Okay, great.

58
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.780
And mainly we click on the login sellers.

59
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.080
We then want to set state.

60
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.960
And what we have to say is it's loaded.

61
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.910
It's going to be equal to true.

62
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.340
Right.

63
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.190
And after we have successfully signed in the user, what we want to do is we want to say dot one completes.

64
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.460
That is after we finished signing up the user.

65
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.100
Then we want to set stage again.

66
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.510
To set a slowdown.

67
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.040
It's more than is equal for us.

68
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.200
Okay.

69
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.170
But if the fields are not valid, right?

70
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.630
We still want to be stuck with force set state and the slogan.

71
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.530
It's going to be hard to force.

72
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.020
Okay.

73
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.100
Forrest okay.

74
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.560
And what if the error is order from this?

75
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.550
That is a it is different from if the error is different from what we have via.

76
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.990
Maybe we can also set a state of a state and it's in.

77
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.580
Should remain at first.

78
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.080
This use needs to save.

79
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.050
And.

80
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.110
We can then.

81
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.450
Look for the log in.

82
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.710
Log in, test.

83
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.950
Logged in test and wire, we can then say is loaded with equal to true.

84
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.500
We didn't want to return a circular.

85
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.850
The Circular Progress Indicator.

86
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.870
And color colours that whites.

87
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.920
Okay.

88
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.950
Colors.

89
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.280
Colors.

90
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.600
White else.

91
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.770
It says.

92
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.060
Okay, great.

93
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.210
And so I'm going to copy this.

94
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.970
Copy this.

95
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.050
Okay.

96
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.970
It's going to do this again for the London silver screen.

97
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.380
London's silver screen.

98
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.700
In the way.

99
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.550
So we can is going to break this down.

100
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.750
And on five days ot exception.

101
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.450
We want to return.

102
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.180
Return.

103
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.060
A snack bar.

104
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.200
Snack bar.

105
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.790
It's a print to show these are the era and this is going to be ee deutsch code.

106
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.360
Okay.

107
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
Create nice country and save.

108
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.200
We also need to save this five.

109
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.750
Okay.

110
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.550
And try this out.

111
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.610
Okay.

112
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.260
I think we have test.

113
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.980
Test to store.

114
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.280
And the password is not your issue.

115
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.870
But B.J. Macy, click on log in.

116
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.110
You can see that there's been a day I think it has been successfully logged in.

117
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:37.170
Now, let's check our new seminar and check outputs to see if you can see seller and you can see the

118
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.580
height of the user.

119
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.280
Yes.

120
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.060
That's a fine listener.

121
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.700
Right.

122
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.590
Seems good.

123
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.000
Sims Good.

124
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.600
Sims Good.

125
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.230
SIM skills.

126
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.950
Sims good.

127
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.010
And we could also try for the.

128
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.460
For the sign up.

129
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.590
The case.

130
00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.960
So I think you have to face that and create a seller's account.

131
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.880
And I'm going to pick this image.

132
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.830
Go, go, go, go, go.

133
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.150
Okay.

134
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.150
So.

135
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.830
And.

136
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.950
Okay.

137
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.510
No, I'm just going to pick this.

138
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.960
And over here for the full name, I'm going to use that test.

139
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.490
Test to store.

140
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.570
So I think the full name okay, we can just use that as the phone name and the email address is going

141
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.460
to be test to store and the password is going to be.

142
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.720
You are messy and let's see if this account will still be created.

143
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.050
Okay.

144
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.160
Sorry.

145
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.900
Okay.

146
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.080
Currently loading.

147
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.790
And as you can see, email is already used and what we have to do.

148
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.190
We also need to turn data force.

149
00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.910
Right.

150
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.810
You can see the account was not created and you can see the error is very clear now.

151
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.330
Okay.

152
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.360
And over here, we also need to turn it to force.

153
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.990
If.

154
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.250
It's called assumption.

155
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.200
We also need to set state.

156
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.240
Said State.

157
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.700
This new copy states and it's loading.

158
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.950
It's going to be equal to force.

159
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.050
I hope this is cleared.

160
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.820
Okay.

161
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.720
Is control.

162
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.210
Okay.

163
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:31.710
Okay.

164
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.460
Okay.

165
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.360
He's gonna try and save, and that's what.

166
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:35.659
It's out.
