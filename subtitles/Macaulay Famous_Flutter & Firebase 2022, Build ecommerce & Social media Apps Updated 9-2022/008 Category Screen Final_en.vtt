00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.620
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.640
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.610
Now, instead of the scholars we have over here, we're going to display the images.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.420
Okay.

5
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.530
Now, to do this, as we know, the container has a property known as child.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.660
And for the child, it's going to be image dot assets.

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.640
Assets.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:35.950
And now we have to point the location of the image it is located at assets slash images that slash men

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.310
and slash men again.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.940
Then we have the zero.

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.820
Dot jpg.

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.070
Right and remember we have up to eight images can see via.

13
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.960
We have up to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

14
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.400
And over here you can see we have this men zero men, one man, two men.

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.220
Three, four, five, six, seven.

16
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.850
Right.

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.840
So what we can do over here, you can see the list.

18
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.950
View that view there.

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.970
It also has a property known as indents.

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.850
And remember, the index is basically referring to how many heights we have.

21
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.620
Right.

22
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.650
So instead of this zero, we can get rid of this.

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:36.110
And another in order to assess this variable, we need to use a dollar sign and then core the indents.

24
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.730
Okay.

25
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.800
And now what we have to do is to how to start this and how to try to come over there and over again

26
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.550
as well in order to give this a very good format.

27
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.440
Okay.

28
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.810
We just have to wait for this now and go check this out, okay?

29
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.310
These are save a lot.

30
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.710
And it has to all to start this category screen.

31
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.570
But you can see.

32
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.790
And for the length, we have to increase this to hate.

33
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.430
His contract saved.

34
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.660
Okay.

35
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.650
Great.

36
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.890
And we can then get rid of this caller.

37
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.000
Right.

38
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.220
The key is control necessary.

39
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.200
And instead of having a container, we can basically just change this, change this to size box so we

40
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.290
don't get confused with a lot of container we have.

41
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.930
And since it basically works the same.

42
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.940
Okay.

43
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.760
Sounds good.

44
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.580
And what we can do is under each item, under each image, we can have a test under it.

45
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.310
To do this, we need hashes to.

46
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.340
Some additional widgets.

47
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.910
Right.

48
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.120
So what we can do.

49
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.440
We are going to wrap this.

50
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.910
This widget with a column.

51
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.960
Right.

52
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.140
So we can then take this as the first widget of the column or the first side of the column.

53
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.390
Right.

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.050
Okay.

55
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.360
And the second child is going to be a test, which will be for now, I just going to say shared and

56
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.150
had the chain of command and these control.

57
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.260
So.

58
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.610
There's no concerts in this country and that's a safe.

59
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.830
And check it out.

60
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.900
You can see --.

61
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.600
Okay.

62
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.770
So what we can do.

63
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.000
We can make this.

64
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.170
Okay.

65
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.700
Okay.

66
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.900
So what we can do now is we can make this dynamic to do that over here, we are going to create a list

67
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.470
of.

68
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.410
So you can just call this list and we are expecting a test.

69
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.900
And so this is going to be strange.

70
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.450
And we can call this man equal to.

71
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.339
This the first.

72
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.670
Item we want, it's going to be shared.

73
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.440
And the second item we want can be maybe see.

74
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.150
Dash --.

75
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.860
The key.

76
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.730
We also do need maybe jackets.

77
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.340
And maybe suits.

78
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.460
And maybe I think we need up to eight.

79
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.240
We can also have jeans.

80
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.820
I don't think I know a lot of clothes for male.

81
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.140
Okay.

82
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.650
We have currently.

83
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.350
One, two, three, four, five.

84
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.770
Okay.

85
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.430
We also do want maybe.

86
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.560
Colt.

87
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.990
Okay.

88
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.060
One, two, three, four, five, six.

89
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.730
We need some more.

90
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.910
Maybe vest.

91
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.670
And lastly, I think.

92
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.390
Maybe shots.

93
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.990
Okay.

94
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.090
And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

95
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.740
Okay.

96
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.430
Use control necessary and also assess that.

97
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.910
We basically just need to call the men and.

98
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.050
So the man and then pass in in dance.

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.660
Okay.

100
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.020
This is basically it.

101
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.600
And use control and save.

102
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.820
Okay.

103
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.460
And we'll check it out.

104
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.150
The case was good, right?

105
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.380
Looking really, really nice.

106
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.930
And for now we do not have anything for the women.

107
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.570
And you can basically just create all this yourself and hopefully you understand this because one of

108
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.330
the major things is understanding.

109
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.550
It is only when you understand that is only when you will be able to build your own stuff.

110
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.710
Because if you don't understand, it's a bit difficult for you to build your own personal projects.

111
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.160
So if you do not understand the world, to let me know.

112
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.840
So I'm going to explain the parts you don't understand.

113
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:55.190
Okay, for now we have this men and the shirts, the t shirts, the jackets, the suits, James coats

114
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.260
and best suits.

115
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.210
Shirts and also I in this.

116
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.370
This should be it and this should be it.

117
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.750
Right?

118
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.080
Okay.

119
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.380
What is okay?

120
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.970
It's okay.

121
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.590
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
