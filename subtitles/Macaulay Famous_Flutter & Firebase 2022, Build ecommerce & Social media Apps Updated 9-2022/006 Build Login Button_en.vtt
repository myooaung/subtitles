00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.750
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.720
Now, this lecture, we're going to create our log in button, and I want to recreate this button from

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.400
scratch.

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.940
Okay, so now what I can do is over here, we can have a training cola.

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.860
Then after this test, first of all, recognize we have a critical law of I can use control and s to

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.840
save that to get a very good robot.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.290
Okay.

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.540
Now, like I said, we created this botnet from scratch.

10
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.890
Okay.

11
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.210
So what you can do is after the test, we can have a container with it.

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.760
Okay.

13
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.130
Now, first of all, they're going to give this person a weight and a height for the weight.

14
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.930
They're going to get the weight of ice screen to get the weight of us.

15
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.580
All we have to do is to say media, media coverage of the contest.

16
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.560
Then the size and weight.

17
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.350
So by doing this, we're going to get the weight of our screen.

18
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.280
Then what you can see is we just want a -40 from it.

19
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.110
Okay.

20
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.280
As well, we're going to give a height.

21
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.460
You can just give the person the height of gravity.

22
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.940
Okay.

23
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.450
Now what we can do is we can have.

24
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.620
A declaration is going to be box declaration.

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.170
Okay.

26
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.050
We can give a color.

27
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.700
First of all, what I can do is to define this collar and the cause that, by the way, we can use var

28
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.750
we can call the scramble plots in.

29
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.320
But seventh column is going to be equal to columns that.

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.220
Red.

31
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.190
They can guess red of 400.

32
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.180
That is a shade.

33
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.810
Okay.

34
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.360
Is control an -- to save?

35
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.990
Okay.

36
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.240
So for the color is going to be the button.

37
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.410
The button collar.

38
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.300
Okay, so I use cloture and this to save and go check it out.

39
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.630
Okay, great sequence is very close to this.

40
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.130
Now, what we can do is we can use this size box over here and they're going to be given this the space

41
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.560
of vertically.

42
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.210
So this is going to be a height of probably 20 as a.

43
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.820
How did training collide so that Canada took it down?

44
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.840
Okay, great.

45
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.660
You are in a coma as well.

46
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.370
Okay, good.

47
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.390
Now aside to the crucial costs, those are crucial class.

48
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.470
What you can have is a chart and you can just have a test of.

49
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.120
That says log in.

50
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.990
Okay.

51
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.740
Now we can give his time to this cancer test.

52
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.270
So I.

53
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.790
We want the Ford Swedes to be bored so we can system Swedes.

54
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.720
That boat.

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.200
Okay.

56
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.250
What's with.

57
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.270
That bird look at you.

58
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.050
Try to save and go check it out.

59
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.610
Okay, now what we can do is we can take it down to the center.

60
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.680
So to do that, what you can just do is.

61
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.000
Why this test we get?

62
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.510
We can get through to Santa.

63
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.670
We get a life for us.

64
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.580
They were going to lose control and thought they were going to go to wrap with Santa is control this

65
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.890
now to say he's going to take it to the center.

66
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.460
Okay.

67
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.240
Now probably we can of a small font size, so to speak, of probably 20.

68
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.510
We're just going to check it out first.

69
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.660
Okay.

70
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.560
Okay, then.

71
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.070
Now, to make this clickable, what you can now do is drop this test.

72
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.320
We just hit the bottom and the bottom is going to be a type of inkwell.

73
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.290
So as well, once again, it is a light for us.

74
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.610
They is Conrad Dodd.

75
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.329
Okay, now we don't have this.

76
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.190
Will we get over here?

77
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.040
So what you can do is go click on what we did.

78
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.590
So there's going to be a link.

79
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.420
In Quo.

80
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.300
Okay.

81
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.900
Well, now this inquest has the autopsy.

82
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.710
Okay.

83
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840
Now what we can just do for now is to separate.

84
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.230
Okay.

85
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.400
You now logged in.

86
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.170
Okay, great.

87
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.450
Over in this, Mickey, you can see we are missing the semicolon.

88
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.550
Okay, I'm trying this to save.

89
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.810
Okay.

90
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.790
Now, this is now clickable.

91
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.140
Okay, now you can go take your seminar.

92
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.190
You can see this is going to be printed out on the screen on your TiVo console.

93
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.660
Okay.

94
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.590
Great.

95
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.190
Okay, guys.

96
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.680
So you in in this lecture.
