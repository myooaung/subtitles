00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.280
Hi, guys, welcome.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.110
That is lecture regular quotes integrated our log in screen.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.450
Okay, now we're going to have two fields that is for the email and for the password.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.890
And both fields that kind of are displayed vertically, that is from top to bottom.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.530
Now in another display widget vertically over using the widget node as column.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.400
Okay.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.750
Now what we can do is we can get rid of the set widget.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.400
Okay.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
Now, like I said, is you're going to have to field that email and the password.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.880
I look at the split vertically and that is from top to bottom.

11
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.950
I wrote that as we did vertically.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.350
I'm going to be using a widget known as column.

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.950
Okay.

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.650
Now over here we can see column.

15
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.490
Now this can take in multiple projects.

16
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.770
It has the property.

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.190
Okay.

18
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.510
Now, what we can do is over here, we can give is semicolon.

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.970
Now you can see we are still having an error.

20
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.640
What you can do is take it over over this.

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.480
Then you can see it was also had an additional parenthesis.

22
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.750
Okay.

23
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.150
Great.

24
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.480
Now we're going to have the test filled.

25
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.610
Okay.

26
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.810
Now, this dispute has what is known as the commission.

27
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.430
This is going to be a huge declaration.

28
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.970
Okay.

29
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.550
Now you're going to give the test, which is more like the place or the intestinal.

30
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.130
And.

31
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.290
Just like we can just enter your email.

32
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.800
Okay.

33
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.520
Now use control and this to save this and go check it out.

34
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.530
Okay.

35
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.970
Now you can sit at the top of.

36
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.300
Okay.

37
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.720
Now what we can do is we can bring it down to the center.

38
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.890
Now, to do this over the column we did.

39
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.350
We can see main us elements.

40
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.180
Main us is alignment towards center.

41
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.260
Okay, great.

42
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.900
This is going to take it to the center.

43
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.060
Okay, great.

44
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.480
Now, what we can do is we'll do a circuit, had a border in all the sides, so we tend to impede the

45
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.140
creation.

46
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.690
We can see the border.

47
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.800
Okay.

48
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.300
This is going to be off line.

49
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690
Line imputes.

50
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.060
But okay.

51
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.080
Now he's got to do this to save.

52
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.300
Okay.

53
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.850
They're going to have put in all the sites.

54
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.660
Okay, great.

55
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.280
Now, what I can do is to have a critical wall there.

56
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.690
Okay.

57
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.750
Great.

58
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.090
Now, when we click on this.

59
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.440
You can see now we have the this greenish, the gray, the greenish color.

60
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.440
Right now we're going to get rid of this gray border.

61
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.330
Not to do this is because.

62
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.960
But she's also a property which tend to be decoration.

63
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.160
This also is going to be the outline.

64
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.320
Outline a border.

65
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.280
Okay.

66
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.790
Now we're just going to the border side.

67
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.940
The border side as well.

68
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.110
Okay.

69
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.450
What we can just do is to change the color.

70
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.200
So if there's a color that black.

71
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.710
Okay.

72
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.900
Now, I think we may see other practices.

73
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.450
What you can't just do is over.

74
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.060
And this you can see.

75
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.440
We need one more.

76
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.140
Okay.

77
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.900
Over on it again.

78
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.920
I'll take another.

79
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.950
Okay, great.

80
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.090
Your trachoma.

81
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.760
Your trachoma is quite true.

82
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.600
It is to say.

83
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.040
Okay.

84
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.520
Okay.

85
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.890
Now you can see he's gone.

86
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.230
Now, what I can do is I can just get rid of the blood of the Buddha.

87
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.990
I cannot do it within the.

88
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.380
Outlined in Pittwater.

89
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.220
What we can't see is border side.

90
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.320
Are going to be border side.

91
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.100
But a side note.

92
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.589
Okay.

93
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.800
So this is going to get rid of the buttocks.

94
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.550
Okay.

95
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.810
Great.

96
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.910
Now, what's kind of weird is to how to treat a coma.

97
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.650
That's a very good coma.

98
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.640
They can see.

99
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.780
We can't really know.

100
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.670
This is a test field.

101
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.520
Now, what we can do is within the declaration, declaration of class, it as well has the property

102
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.500
known as do so field.

103
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.360
Okay, now we're going to see that it's true.

104
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.290
So by doing this is going to give the test field a critical.

105
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.780
Okay.

106
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.890
Go check it out.

107
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.910
Okay, great.

108
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.420
Now, lastly, what we can do is we can do a pardon over here.

109
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.610
You can see we have no space between the left and the right.

110
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.020
Now, what we can just do in that is we have access to the.

111
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.650
Hot property.

112
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.950
What you can't just do is alright, we can.

113
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.360
I like this colloquy that first there is control and that's regular of a container.

114
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.910
Okay, now over.

115
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.830
You can see say pardon it.

116
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.160
We can see edge is set.

117
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.850
Just says we can just give both sides.

118
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.460
That's all you can give a pardon of to try to save.

119
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.810
Okay.

120
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.260
Great.

121
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.280
Okay.

122
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:01.110
Now, with the knowledge you gain from this, try to implement the password.

123
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.190
Build yourself.

124
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.240
Okay.

125
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.190
Okay, guys.

126
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.480
See you in the mess.

127
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.690
That's.
