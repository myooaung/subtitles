00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.780
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.590
Now, what we can well do is we can give you background color.

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.880
So this icon.

5
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.450
Okay.

6
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.660
Now, to do this, it needs to go back to a vertical.

7
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.260
Okay.

8
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.680
Now, you can see this is the icon widget, right?

9
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.660
And over here we have a container.

10
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.190
Now you can see one of the needs to use a container.

11
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.790
So we have access to lots of properties.

12
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.230
Okay.

13
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.080
Now to give a background color.

14
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.189
So this icon, all we just have to say is color that is going to be colors dot white.

15
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.930
But really we can barely see.

16
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.210
This other reason is that our scaffold has a color of white.

17
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.910
Okay, so what you can just do is change this to red for now.

18
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.390
Okay.

19
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.830
Is coach this to save?

20
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.730
Okay.

21
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.300
And then go check it out.

22
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.760
Okay.

23
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.290
They can see this, right?

24
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.680
Okay.

25
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.920
Now what we can do.

26
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.560
We can give access to.

27
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.840
We can give you the surrounded ship.

28
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.470
Right.

29
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.890
Okay.

30
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.860
Now we're just going to get rid of this call over here.

31
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.350
So we have access to loss of properties.

32
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.160
So what you can just sort of that we can say declaration.

33
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.350
There's going to be box declaration.

34
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.730
Okay.

35
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.570
Now we're going to have access to a lot of properties, including that color, so we can see color is

36
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.970
going to be colors that red for now.

37
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.450
Okay.

38
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.560
Okay.

39
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.130
Great.

40
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.220
Now, well, let's we can as well.

41
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.950
This is going to be very, very straight.

42
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.350
Right.

43
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.400
So we can give some meta rounded shape to this.

44
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.640
So we just have to say now is what every year you can see we have access to a lot of properties because

45
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.320
you're using the bus decorations class.

46
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.340
Okay.

47
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.130
So there's going to be for the videos that are often.

48
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.900
Right.

49
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.380
Okay.

50
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.910
Now he's got is here to see what it does.

51
00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.340
Okay.

52
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.060
You can see it.

53
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.990
Okay.

54
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.480
Now we just need to hide our true Nikola.

55
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.620
Right.

56
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.020
Okay.

57
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.790
Now, really, where they're going to be going with this Red Bull, it's going to be going with the

58
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.020
white collar.

59
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.440
Right.

60
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.560
So now they're out to make this white visible.

61
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.390
You can see for now it is not going to be visible.

62
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.180
Right.

63
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.890
It's not going to be visible or hopefully you can see it a bit.

64
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.330
Okay.

65
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.600
And as I said, this will make it more visible.

66
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.630
What we can do is we can had a shadow to this.

67
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.050
Okay.

68
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.480
So within the buzz decoration class of about one of the reasons that made us users was decoration was

69
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.030
in order for us to have access to loss of properties.

70
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.410
Okay.

71
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.840
So there's going to be Boss Shadow.

72
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.580
It's going to take a list.

73
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.910
Okay.

74
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.870
So there's going to be a boss.

75
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.820
Sorry.

76
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.880
He's going to be Bullock's shadow.

77
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.930
Book's shadow.

78
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.590
Okay, now what you can't do.

79
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.490
We can't give a colour to this.

80
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.200
It's just going to be colour.

81
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.330
Colours dot grey.

82
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.540
Okay.

83
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.610
Then we can associate dots, weeds, opacity of zero dots theory.

84
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.300
Okay.

85
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.370
Added to the cover.

86
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.360
Now what we can do?

87
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.100
We can use bird videos.

88
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.030
So this is going to be 0.1, right?

89
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.200
And as well, we can give a blur, make it block with blur of 0.1 as well.

90
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.370
One as well.

91
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.300
Then lastly for the offset or yourself to say is offset.

92
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.230
Okay.

93
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.550
They were able to pass in zero the comma and work.

94
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.210
Okay, great.

95
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.790
Now.

96
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.200
How to treat a cholera.

97
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.340
And use controlled excessive.

98
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.490
Okay.

99
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.270
Great.

100
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.770
Now go check it out.

101
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.030
Okay.

102
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.600
Hopefully you can see this, right?

103
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.670
You can now see this shadow with this white color.

104
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.390
Now what you can do can take this a bit from the right.

105
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.650
Right.

106
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.839
Where you have a part in.

107
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.100
I think.

108
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.250
Last year for the right as well.

109
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.750
They're going to give right off Terzi.

110
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.050
Okay.

111
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.680
Needs to see and go check it out.

112
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.860
Okay.

113
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.560
I think that is way too much.

114
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.270
We're just going to give 25 for the right.

115
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.400
Okay, good.

116
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.240
Check it out now.

117
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.030
Okay.

118
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.800
I think this is okay.

119
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.970
I probably think.

120
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.390
I think this is okay.

121
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.870
Okay.

122
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.550
Okay, guys.

123
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.130
See you in this lecture.
