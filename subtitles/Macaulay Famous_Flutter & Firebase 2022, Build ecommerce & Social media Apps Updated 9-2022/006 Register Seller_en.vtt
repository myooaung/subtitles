00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.460
In this lecture, we are going to create the functionality to sign up sellers.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.300
Okay.

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.379
And that to do this, we have to head up to the London cellar screen and what we can do, we can use

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.300
control and beta, make this wide.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.700
And instead of having this code over here, we can just cut it off.

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.100
Okay, it's control and see to copy and then backspace to delete.

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.720
Okay.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:39.690
And for the now we can just create a function of a void and we can call this function sign up.

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.740
Okay.

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.250
And we can just go ahead and easily try and catch block to check and catch any errors.

13
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.410
And we tend to try.

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.720
I'm going to paste this code and use control and it has to save.

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.990
And remember what you are basically saying if.

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.620
The form key that current state dot is valid.

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.960
If the form is valid, then Olie wants to print all this to the debug console.

18
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.020
But what we can do, we can just get rid of this.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.070
And if the form is valid, we first of all want to use the async since we are going to be using the

20
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.730
it.

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.510
If it is valid, then we want to await and.

22
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.220
Over here.

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.600
We can just create a queue.

24
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.140
Already have this odd controller.

25
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.700
Sorry.

26
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.590
I think this is for the.

27
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.320
Class.

28
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.190
Right.

29
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.240
So we need finer and firebase.

30
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.140
Parts.

31
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.920
And we can call this on the score.

32
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.320
Trapezoids are not.

33
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.170
On the score card, so it won't get confusing with this.

34
00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.800
We can just say fabulous art and it goes to is firebase art that it stands right.

35
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.410
Okay dot instance.

36
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.460
Okay.

37
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.180
Great.

38
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.560
And now we can then say.

39
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.290
I wait underscore firebase.

40
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.830
For what that word does.

41
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.380
It creates user with email and password, and you can see it automatically pass this variable via the

42
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.130
email and it automatically passed the password as well.

43
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.810
And over here we need to add a semicolon.

44
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.250
Now the next step is to store the image.

45
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.120
Right.

46
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.070
But we're just going to do that later.

47
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.190
Then we can just go ahead and store the the input of the user.

48
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.580
Right.

49
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.300
To do that, we have to then wait again.

50
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.000
But before then, we have to import firebase.

51
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.710
Right.

52
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.900
Okay, we'll buy it.

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.550
We can then say fine.

54
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.590
And our base.

55
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.920
Five years faster.

56
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.700
Yes.

57
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.960
And on the score, you can just call this on the score.

58
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.240
Five days and it's close to five days faster.

59
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.820
Okay.

60
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.650
And.

61
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.760
And now we can.

62
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.250
Over.

63
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.990
Over or over.

64
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.590
Where?

65
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.390
So I think I can look over you and we can do it again.

66
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.600
And then cor underscore firebase.

67
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.800
Five is for a store.

68
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.920
Sorry.

69
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.350
The score.

70
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.410
Five ways.

71
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.110
Or we could have just copy that code we have over there.

72
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.640
It's basically the same thing.

73
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.410
I just want to show you this one more time.

74
00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.770
Firebase underscore dot watch dot collection and the name of the collection is going to be sales and

75
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.590
those words.

76
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:13.110
The short doc because each seller is going to be connected to the seller's collection and for the connection.

77
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.480
We can call the.

78
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.870
Documents underscore Firebase Odds to get the current logged in user.

79
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.940
Dodds What does connect the dots UID and why?

80
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.160
We need a no check.

81
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.700
And now we can then say dot set is basically asking us for the fields we need.

82
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.850
Okay.

83
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.090
The first field we need is going to be the cell ID.

84
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.830
So what we can just say, we can just spec this in full seller ID and this is going to be.

85
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.800
This is going to be what this is going to be on underscore firebase or you can just store the results

86
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.160
and we can just store all this because create or we can just go ahead and use the firebase art that.

87
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.330
Client is a that's uid.

88
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.310
Okay.

89
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.400
What's in the order?

90
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.070
Customer section where we created the customer functionality to sign up users.

91
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.340
We store the results in.

92
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.220
They're available.

93
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:31.410
You can see via the fabulous art where you can see all the scores created there with a password.

94
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.410
And what we basically did was to create a variable called create and restore whatever results we're

95
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.890
going to have over here.

96
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.710
And we're basically using the create.

97
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.140
So it's basically the same results both we give us the forbis art.

98
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.880
We also do give us the correct log, the user uid.

99
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.630
So that is why we are using this way.

100
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.570
But you can basically just copy all this is the same thing.

101
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.520
Okay.

102
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.740
Just that we are using another approach.

103
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.480
Sorry.

104
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.510
Cancel and back to the seller London seller screen.

105
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.890
And the other field we need is going to be the store name.

106
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.130
The full name of the user of the seller is going to serve as the store name.

107
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.750
Or probably we could just rename this to store name or this is just okay.

108
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.910
But in the database we're going to say this as the store name.

109
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.750
Store name.

110
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.060
Store name.

111
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.820
Sorry.

112
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.960
And for the store name is going to be the name, right?

113
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.690
And we need the train to come over here.

114
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.010
I'm just going to check.

115
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.950
I think we call this.

116
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.550
What?

117
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.390
We called it full name.

118
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.460
So.

119
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.970
That was why it was undefined.

120
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.460
And the other field we need is what?

121
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.600
The address of the user.

122
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.910
And currently we are living it.

123
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.000
We don't really need the address for the for the seller.

124
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.560
We just we can just go ahead with it and leave it empty for now.

125
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.900
And the other food we need is.

126
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.280
You can just do this right after.

127
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.900
Here is the email of the seller.

128
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.920
Email.

129
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.210
And I think that is the only fields we need.

130
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.790
Email for name.

131
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.870
That is the store name and this and this.

132
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.550
Okay.

133
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.590
Okay.

134
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.100
That should be all for now.

135
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.920
We can just use control and save.

136
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.800
And over here, we need to call that function.

137
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.340
Right.

138
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.630
Call the function.

139
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.380
And sign.

140
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.800
Up.

141
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.590
Okay.

142
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.400
And use control and save.

143
00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.510
Okay.

144
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.450
And can then try this out.

145
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.920
We do not really need to pick an image for now because we've not had it.

146
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.150
We have not had that any validation check for that.

147
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.430
So we can just go ahead and.

148
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.460
They say the store name is going to be Mark Sharp.

149
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.930
And the email address is going to show up at G.M. dot com.

150
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.950
This calm.

151
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.250
Dot com and the password is going to be G-a-y esque.

152
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.520
Hopefully the password is correct and we can then click on sign up.

153
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.080
We have not added any modern spinner for now and we can just check out seminar to see what is going

154
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.710
on there.

155
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.240
Okay.

156
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.180
Hopefully that's been successfully created.

157
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.060
We can just refresh this.

158
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.600
And see.

159
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.910
Okay.

160
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.590
Who fully knew errors.

161
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.890
We should have a new collection called users.

162
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.820
Okay.

163
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.390
Sorry.

164
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.720
Called.

165
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:24.530
As you can see, we have this new collection called Sellers and the address email the seller uid the

166
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.340
store name.

167
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.140
Right.

168
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.960
This is good.

169
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.140
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
