00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.050
Guys, welcome.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.130
Now, this lecture, we're going to create the functionality to pick image.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.580
But before then, over the sign up screen, what you can easily just do is to uncomment this.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.390
Okay.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.940
So I'm gonna light.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.530
Then I'm going to use control and backslash.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.640
And that's uncomment this.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.780
Okay, great.

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.100
Now, I've done this for five pictures.

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.270
What we can do is we can go to our browser.

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.830
Then you're going to search for a default user profile image painting.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620
Okay, then over this one, anyone you desire.

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.880
But I'm just going to go with this.

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.630
They're going to open this link in a new tab.

15
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.830
Then it's going to take you to a page like this.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.360
Right.

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.650
Then you're going to copy the image address.

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.910
Okay, good.

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.650
So you can see you can copy the copy email address.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.040
Okay.

21
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.810
Instead of this pathetic test, what they can do is they're going to face this I a great.

22
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.230
Now we're going to restart this.

23
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.540
Okay.

24
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.530
But we start.

25
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.890
Okay.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.000
Then go check it out.

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.760
It's going to get displayed.

28
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.740
Okay, great.

29
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.500
Now, what they're going to do next is they're going to create the functionality to pick image.

30
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.920
Okay.

31
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.240
Now, remember we said the controllers for the is.

32
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.460
We're going to be doing our logic, right?

33
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.420
We agreed to that.

34
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.700
Right.

35
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.110
Okay.

36
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.400
Now what we're going to do, we can either create a new file for this, but since the image has to do

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.750
with the arts education as well, we can't just create the functionality in our whole controller.

38
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.290
Okay.

39
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.880
Now what we can do is we can make this wider.

40
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.390
Right.

41
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.090
Then you can just do this at the top where we can.

42
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.660
Give your comments, then we can sit on.

43
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.290
To enable users peak image.

44
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.030
Okay, now before continue please note there are a couple of ways to do the same thing in Flutter.

45
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.230
That is, you can use different approach and you're going to achieve the same results.

46
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.710
Not in this try this course.

47
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.020
They will let out a thick image in different ways.

48
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.400
Okay, well, you can just stick with anyone you feel it is so okay for you.

49
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.470
Also understandable to you.

50
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.880
Okay.

51
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.600
Now what they're going to do is, first of all, we are going to create a reusable image picker.

52
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.340
So you're going to be able to peek from either gallery or camera easily, which attracts in Morse code.

53
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.730
Okay.

54
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.680
So first of all.

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.710
What we would do is we're going to create a function which we can call peak.

56
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.690
Image.

57
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.880
Okay, now, we can easily just, uh, create a verbal code when we find you can pick this image.

58
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.360
Right.

59
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.940
The concern is equal to the image.

60
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.670
Image pic I wish we had earlier start.

61
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.740
In this picture.

62
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.690
Then we can see that's.

63
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.280
The image as you guys is asking for the source.

64
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.200
Image, source.

65
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.540
Okay.

66
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.840
That's gallery.

67
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.260
Okay.

68
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.660
Now we can easily just do this, but if one shows a big for the camera, we have to repeat ourself again.

69
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.070
Remember, there is a law of programming which says to not repeat yourself.

70
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.270
So what they're going to try to do is to make this more dynamic.

71
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.790
Okay, so we're going to get rid of this.

72
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.899
Okay?

73
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.670
So like we said, you're going to create a function and we can call this function peak image, right?

74
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.090
Okay.

75
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.280
So now I'm going to make this dynamic.

76
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.560
So what we can do is we're going to pass in the.

77
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.850
It was.

78
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.780
Source.

79
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.440
So the of pasta sauce.

80
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.050
Okay, so what we did was a pass in sauce.

81
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.810
Then we said, is it type of in this sauce?

82
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.070
So this when it was, you'd have to pick image from gallery or camera.

83
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.080
Okay, great.

84
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.950
Now the next they're going to do is they're going to create a final variable and you're going to call

85
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.610
this what is called image picker.

86
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.940
Okay.

87
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.290
Is going to be equal to the image picker.

88
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.980
Okay, great.

89
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.660
Now we can associate.

90
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.670
This is a type.

91
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.840
This variable is a type of image picker.

92
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.250
Okay, great.

93
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.870
Now, what we can do now is we can.

94
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:37.720
So we can wear we can dance to this variable that is old school image.

95
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.410
Pikka.

96
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.660
The words.

97
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.230
Peak image.

98
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.630
Okay.

99
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.480
Now you can just pass in the source that I'm actually.

100
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.920
Okay, great.

101
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.870
Now we can also store this study results and available and we can call the variable on this call phi.

102
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.130
Okay.

103
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.240
This is going to be a type of this is a type of is.

104
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.890
Is why.

105
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.450
Okay.

106
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:16.110
They're going to say equal to what we can do is because I wait for the image because then also not easy

107
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.500
awaits.

108
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.540
We need to use the word is sick.

109
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.510
Okay.

110
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.550
I think we have in some.

111
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.220
Issues.

112
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.760
With.

113
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.760
English become.

114
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.180
Okay.

115
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.730
We can.

116
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.270
Yes, we can.

117
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.560
Can be.

118
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.950
No.

119
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.540
Okay, great.

120
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.690
Great.

121
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.050
Now what they're going to do next is we're going to check if the user actually picked the image or not.

122
00:06:51.650 --> 00:07:01.640
So what we can do now is we can use an EVE statement, then we can see if this variable or that is caused

123
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.570
by.

124
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:11.090
Is not equipped to know that is the user actually picked the image if it is not in quotes or no that

125
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.200
once written.

126
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.140
I always.

127
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.110
On this qualify.

128
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.990
Not with us, but.

129
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.220
Okay, great.

130
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.080
Else.

131
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.130
User refuses to take an image.

132
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.370
Then we just want to print this to ourself.

133
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.720
This is no image.

134
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.490
Selected.

135
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.450
Okay.

136
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.350
Great.

137
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.110
Great.

138
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.250
Okay.

139
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.890
Now, what we simply did is we created a very backward peak image.

140
00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.800
Sorry, not a variable, but function we created in function called peak image.

141
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.540
Right.

142
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.660
Then we passed in the source.

143
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:13.160
The source is referring to how we have been able to image it from what where the gallery or the camera.

144
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.330
Then we also said is a type of image source.

145
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.060
Okay.

146
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.590
Then we created a file available which required.

147
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.880
Image picker.

148
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.800
But it's called image pickup, which we said is equal to the image because we get.

149
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.340
Right.

150
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.380
Then as well.

151
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.990
We said this is a type of image picker.

152
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.970
Okay, then.

153
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.760
Where we simply use the rainbow, which we had earlier created called image picker.

154
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.010
But this image requires a viable story.

155
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.590
This image picks up, right?

156
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.620
So we said image because that's peak image.

157
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:59.310
So something you can easily just get rid of this line similar to saying something like this image because

158
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.760
it peak.

159
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.570
Okay.

160
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.250
So that was what I was going to say.

161
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.480
Okay.

162
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.520
So this image, picado, it's peak image, then this source.

163
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.360
Let's have a little faith in this source.

164
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.000
That was the reason why we made this dynamic.

165
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.830
So because these are passing this source, that's a peek from gallery of people on camera.

166
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:19.790
Okay.

167
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.010
So this source is referring to how we are going to be able to pick images up from the gallery or the

168
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.550
camera.

169
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:33.500
And over here, we are simply checking that if the user actually picked the image, then once we written.

170
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.980
Fight or treat us fight and also we are within it.

171
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.840
Else if the user refuses to pick an image, probably.

172
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.790
He mystically clicked on the image.

173
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.130
We simply click on the icons of the image.

174
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.450
And if you refuse to pick that image, then we just want to print this.

175
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.020
So I said, okay, that is what I've got to say.

176
00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:03.070
And like I said, they look composed of approaches to do the same thing, slow to work, whichever way

177
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.250
you feel is more understandable to you or more clear to you.

178
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.450
You can just try to master that pattern you get.

179
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.320
Okay.
