Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.450
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.900
In this lecture, we're going to create a flat out project, and I'm going to create this with a project

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.160
in my text of the tree.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
But you can create this with a project in any of the territory you so desire.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.500
Okay, now to do this, I'm going to first need to say, see the text that is changed our tree.

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.720
Dexter Okay.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.190
Okay.

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.240
Not so creative.

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.820
Float approaches is all we just have to say is flutter and create.

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.830
And then the name of the project we are going to call this zoom on this call app.

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.270
Okay.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.590
Okay.

14
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.680
Like you can see creates in projects.

15
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.870
Zoom underscore have.

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.460
This is going to take some time.

17
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.850
Okay.

18
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.960
Now all we can do is just come into this project we just created.

19
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.210
So we can see this CD, Zoom.

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.200
Zoom underscore app.

21
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.190
And we can open it on visa code.

22
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.580
I see code and dots.

23
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.140
I can just open this and then you have your code editor.

24
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.530
Okay.

25
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.360
But for me, I'm using the visa code.

26
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.960
Okay.

27
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.440
Great.

28
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.040
Now those are the defaults, pops.

29
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.580
So it defaults fi's floats are created.

30
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.880
For us now.

31
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.670
All we can do is we can go to the league directory and mend the dots.

32
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.710
And over here you can simply run this.

33
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.120
Okay.

34
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.840
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
