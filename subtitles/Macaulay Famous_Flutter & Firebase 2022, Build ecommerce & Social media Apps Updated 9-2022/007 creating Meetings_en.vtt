00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.510
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.080
Sorcha.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.940
Now I surely got an error.

4
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.700
And the reason for the error is because I was visiting our version of Gradle that is disabled as what

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.270
I.

6
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.970
What I simply did to get rid of that arrow was to reduce backward aversion to the defaults, which is

7
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.870
Sister seven.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.170
So make sure you are so using the same gradle version then that possible errors you might get.

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.200
Is the app refusing to install or storage issues.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.159
The reason for that is because Jeff is a very powerful package and requires some more android space

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.070
not to get rid of the storage arrows.

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.760
All you just have to do is to go to your Android studio, then your NBT, then you're going to need

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.640
to locate your hardware emulator.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.950
Then you're going to need to wipe the data.

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.020
Okay, now, if for any reasons you can't locate that, you can do so, let me know.

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.000
So I make a video for you.

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.780
Okay.

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.500
Now, in this lecture, what you're going to do is you're going to create a function so that users are

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
going to be able to click on this and then create a return.

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.459
Okay.

21
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.760
Now to do this, first of all, I'm going to go through and be to make this similar, then I'm just

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.750
going to collapse this.

23
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.930
Then they're going to create this new fly, they're going to create this file in the controller's folder.

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.640
So I will go to sleep.

25
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.680
Then I will go to controllers.

26
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.490
The controllers folder is where we're going to be creating all the functionalities or the logic of our

27
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.850
hub.

28
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.270
Okay.

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.870
Now to do this, I'm just going to create a new fly.

30
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:45.680
And they're going to call this fi jets c underscore controller to station which is dot dot.

31
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.390
Okay.

32
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.220
Now we can use Kaletra and B to make this way in order to always have a wash, more cleaner code.

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.840
What we can do is we can wrap everything with the cloth and we can then call this class jet.

34
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.270
See Controller.

35
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.030
Okay.

36
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.720
Now the next step is to create a function.

37
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.270
So now we are going to create a function.

38
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.650
It is going to say void.

39
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.150
Then they're going to call this function create.

40
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.440
Medicine.

41
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.800
They're going to be using the async.

42
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.410
We're going to be using the weight.

43
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.020
If you if you need to use the weight, you need to pass the physical via.

44
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.560
Okay.

45
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.910
Now what?

46
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.400
They're going to do this instead of typing all the calls, we already have it over.

47
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.770
Yeah.

48
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.340
Okay.

49
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.950
Okay.

50
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.780
This is the way.

51
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.140
So you can easily just copy from this.

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.640
Try until this.

53
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.510
Okay.

54
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.330
Coffee and then we can taste.

55
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.680
Right.

56
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.160
Okay.

57
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.580
Now, we can use control handles in order to import the Jets package.

58
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.500
Okay.

59
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.440
The reasons I can see into that.

60
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.030
Okay.

61
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.400
I'm just going to try to close this.

62
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.300
Five.

63
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.840
The.

64
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.920
Okay.

65
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.490
Save.

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.400
That are just going to try to open it again.

67
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.290
Okay.

68
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.740
Control V now will lose control and that's okay for some reasons.

69
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.460
I can't here.

70
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.070
Q Okay, great points.

71
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.300
And this is what I'm trying to dodge.

72
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.290
Okay.

73
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.160
The parts.

74
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.880
Okay.

75
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.650
Now they're going to get rid of this.

76
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:21.470
Then we had our semicolon since this is the last set of the Borg print.

77
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.350
We don't have like that in water.

78
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.850
So this is going to be prints, right?

79
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.260
Okay.

80
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.630
Okay.

81
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.620
Now, it was a surprise.

82
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.190
An additional argument.

83
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.860
Which is known as the room.

84
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.360
That is the name of the room.

85
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.000
So we are going to pass in the room over here.

86
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.550
Then you're going to get what you can see.

87
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.740
This is called my room.

88
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.730
But we are going to automatically generate a room named for the user.

89
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.380
So we're going to get rid of this.

90
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.970
Okay.

91
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.830
Now to make this dynamic, your room name dynamic.

92
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.340
What we can do is over this function are going to use equality brackets.

93
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.240
Then we're going to create a variable called room name.

94
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.240
Later, we're going to pass the name rule name.

95
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.650
Okay.

96
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.880
Now, this is a test and it is a type of word string.

97
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.580
Okay.

98
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.220
And we can make this required.

99
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.960
So any time we call this creativity function, we need to pass and that value.

100
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.680
Okay, so over here, the pass of the room.

101
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.630
Room name.

102
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.250
Okay, great.

103
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.710
Now.

104
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.280
We don't, actually.

105
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.910
Need the server URL since we don't have.

106
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.330
So we're going to get rid of this as well.

107
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.870
We don't need a subject, so we're going to get rid of this.

108
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.070
Okay.

109
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.070
You can see it is now local sized.

110
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.450
Okay, so now what you're going to do is we're going to get the current user display name, current

111
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.560
user email.

112
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.940
User Avatar and others well before then it is going to solve this.

113
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.100
Now Zoom does not have this audio only future.

114
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.440
So we are going to get rid of this.

115
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.310
And for this to value use that as the audio motor that the video muted.

116
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.150
I'm going to make it more dynamic.

117
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.600
So what we're going to do is we also going to create available so with a give it away.

118
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.490
So this is going to be is.

119
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.640
Ordeal.

120
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.850
Is audio muted?

121
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.780
Okay.

122
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.630
Now, this is a true and false value.

123
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.150
So it is a data type of view.

124
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.970
Right.

125
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.390
Okay.

126
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.200
Now all we can require this required.

127
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.850
Okay.

128
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.390
Now you can then order.

129
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.730
Truly, Koba is going to be his video.

130
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.320
His widow, Ted.

131
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.400
Okay.

132
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.080
It is the type of boom.

133
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.710
And as well we can required this.

134
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.790
Okay.

135
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.370
Now, I said this.

136
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.180
True.

137
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.000
So we can then make it is.

138
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:29.360
Is audio muted so whatever past is going to be it's so there's going to be is video.

139
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.220
This video.

140
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.850
Mute it.

141
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.260
Okay, great.

142
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.180
Now, the next thing we're going to do is you're going to get the correct user email.

143
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:46.370
The Current is a just rename and the correct user image that is attached to the Google accounts.

144
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.790
Okay.

145
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.960
Not to do that.

146
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.020
This is going to use control nets to save this first, then release control and B to make the swallow.

147
00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:00.070
Then we're going to go to our hearts controller dead, release control and being able to make this wide.

148
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.610
Now, to get that, I'll just have to say to get the current logged in user.

149
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.860
We are going to create a variable called user.

150
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.150
So what we can do is we can say user.

151
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.300
This is referring to the hot user, right?

152
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.630
So user is going to be user.

153
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.740
Then no function then.

154
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.600
So it's going to be user, then gets user.

155
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.370
They're going to use an error function.

156
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.370
Okay.

157
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.830
Now all we can say is it's variable.

158
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.120
Right.

159
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.039
So let's call arcs.

160
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.590
Dirt cards, user dots.

161
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.600
What?

162
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:50.380
Okay.

163
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.990
So that's correct.

164
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.380
User.

165
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.890
We just want to get.

166
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.150
Just one property rights.

167
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.410
So if it was just the they would consider, then this.

168
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.850
So they're just going to say that.

169
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.930
So we have access to everything that has to do with that user.

170
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.560
Okay.

171
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.050
So now we have athletes contribute to make this smaller.

172
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.640
Okay.

173
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:18.520
We're going to use control s to say this 5/1, then we're going to go to our jet controller.

174
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:19.900
Okay.

175
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.480
Now, the first thing to do is to.

176
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:32.070
In order to have access to this user variable called user rights, we need to first of access to the

177
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.430
horse controller.

178
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:34.400
Right.

179
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.900
Okay.

180
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.100
So now what you can do.

181
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.160
All this class we can.

182
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.280
See.

183
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.900
FINA.

184
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.340
On this score.

185
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.410
Arts culture is beloved, equal to the arts.

186
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.260
What controller?

187
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.590
Okay, now we can give you a type.

188
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.830
It is a type of what?

189
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.880
Ultimate to right.

190
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.940
Well, it's controller.

191
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.040
Okay, great.

192
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.940
Now you can have access to that user.

193
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:11.950
So we're going to get rid of this is going to be underscore hard control all rights standards.

194
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:12.880
User.

195
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.530
Okay.

196
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.370
We kind of we have access to the user now.

197
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.950
They're going to see the ads display name.

198
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.610
Okay.

199
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.880
So for this, we're going to get rid of this.

200
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.050
Okay.

201
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.240
To underscore.

202
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.140
But.

203
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.800
Controller that is going to be dot user and dot email, right?

204
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.200
The email address associated to the Google account.

205
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.690
So now we're going to get rid of this as well.

206
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.240
Right.

207
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.610
So this is going to be on the score.

208
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.430
It's going to be on the score.

209
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.010
Control our standards.

210
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.140
User standards.

211
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.290
Photo URL.

212
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.880
Okay, great.

213
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.390
Now, this is basically all we need.

214
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.010
Right.

215
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.820
The first thing we did was to pass or create the rule name for it.

216
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.110
Now, we have not given the rule a name, right?

217
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:20.430
We said the room name should be whatever regular pass whenever we call this function called create medicine.

218
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.680
So in this lecture they're going to call this function called creates return.

219
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.820
Right.

220
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:33.840
And over there, we're going to create a dynamic rule named for the user, probably going to generate

221
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.000
a number which we should be able to call what we test as the rule name.

222
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.160
So that's what I was saying for the now we are not positive they will name.

223
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.370
We can basically just say over here.

224
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.480
My room.

225
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.470
Right.

226
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.190
What?

227
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.690
We want to make it more dynamic.

228
00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.040
So we have to create a variable hot room right then.

229
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.380
And in this lecture, whenever we call this function, they're going to need to.

230
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:11.130
Pass the values to this silly fables we have.

231
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.230
That is the room name.

232
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.380
Is audio muted and is video muted?

233
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:15.870
Right.

234
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:16.220
Okay.

235
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.720
So this is basically it.

236
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:25.460
This is how easy it is to create the function in order for users to be able to create meta.

237
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.850
Okay.

238
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.600
So in this lecture, they're going to be able to use this function.

239
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.020
Okay.

240
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.990
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
