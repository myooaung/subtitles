00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.570
Hi.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.290
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.220
Now over.

4
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.380
You are going to have a arbor.

5
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.810
Okay, let's do this.

6
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.710
We're going to need to go back to our site code and then we're going to go to the car screen.

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.210
Okay.

8
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.110
And now we can use culture and beats to make this white.

9
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.680
Okay.

10
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.720
Now this scaffold has a property known as App Bar.

11
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.820
Hub.

12
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.500
Well, ah.

13
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.340
Okay.

14
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.290
It's going to be harbor widgets.

15
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.310
Okay.

16
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.420
Now, this harbor has the property known as title.

17
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.130
This is going to be a test widget.

18
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.050
For the now he's just going to say cards.

19
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.900
Item counts.

20
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.740
Okay.

21
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.150
The OC says it's okay.

22
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.660
Now use control and it's safe and good to get out.

23
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.140
Are you going to see the wire?

24
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.470
Okay.

25
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.250
Okay.

26
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.000
Now we can change the background color.

27
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.660
We can.

28
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.290
The ABA has the property background color.

29
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.270
You can say colors.

30
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.200
That's probably why it's.

31
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.040
17.

32
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.750
We're just going to check.

33
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.640
It's going to look like.

34
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.960
Okay.

35
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.320
Okay.

36
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.350
And for the test, you can also tie.

37
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.580
Exclude test sti.

38
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.020
We can't say color is going to be colors that.

39
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.280
BLOCK okay.

40
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.910
Okay.

41
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.650
Okay.

42
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.510
Now.

43
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.060
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.870
We can't have an icon.

45
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.220
Okay.

46
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.430
Not to do that.

47
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:12.390
We'll have an icon at the right side of the harbor as a property within the harbor.

48
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.780
Right.

49
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.180
Okay.

50
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510
We're going to come back from the test, which does it for putting on this action.

51
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.930
Okay.

52
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.050
Now we're going to use the icon button.

53
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.760
I think you can see it as your press.

54
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.920
We can't leave this empty for now and we can use the icon widgets.

55
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.770
Is going to be basically easy.

56
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.490
Cupertino.

57
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.300
Cooper see no icons that seem like trash.

58
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.630
Okay.

59
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.490
Critical critical editorial core and use culture and as a safe.

60
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.190
Okay.

61
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.680
You can see to my right.

62
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.240
Not like I will always say, you don't really need to follow these updates I'm using.

63
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.130
You don't need to follow the callers.

64
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.110
I'm using it.

65
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.490
You can as well go with yours.

66
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.760
Right.

67
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.880
So you don't really need to use all the same as that callers I'm using.

68
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.880
Okay, now what's you can do over here?

69
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.630
We can.

70
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.410
Okay.

71
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.870
We can increase the font size.

72
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.230
Two.

73
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.900
Probably 17.

74
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.290
Okay.

75
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.800
And we can say fun tweets.

76
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.540
It's going to haunt Sweets.

77
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.460
Dart.

78
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.610
They'll w.

79
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.690
500.

80
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.900
We don't want it to be that boat.

81
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.250
Okay.

82
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.750
Great.

83
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.140
Okay.

84
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.630
Okay.

85
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.290
Great.

86
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.210
Probably okay.

87
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.290
This creates.

88
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.570
Okay.

89
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.790
And in this lecture, we're going to have the checkout button.

90
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.870
And over here they're going to have the tutor and the total price displayed.

91
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.230
Okay.

92
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.320
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
