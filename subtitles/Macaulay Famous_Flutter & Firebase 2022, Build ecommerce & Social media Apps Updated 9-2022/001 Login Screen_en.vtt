00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.030
In this lecture, we're going to start building the login screen.

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:13.140
Okay, now over this old folder, we are going to create a new file and we're going to call this file

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.850
customer on the score, log in on the score screen and then the section is dot dots.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.660
The login screen is going to look like that of the London customer's screen.

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.830
So what we can do, we can alight all this by using controller and A and then copy.

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.120
And then over the customer log in screen, we can use control and B and then paste this code.

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.730
OC And now we have to rename the class.

10
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.620
So over here we can alight and use contraband.

11
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.350
Contraband in a light similar name.

12
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.660
Okay.

13
00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.270
And now we can rename this to customer login screen.

14
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.930
Okay.

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.560
Great.

16
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.950
And now over the mandate fi.

17
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.340
For now we have to change this London customer screen to be.

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.950
The.

19
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.230
Customer.

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.730
Log in.

21
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.070
And screen.

22
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.030
Okay.

23
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.440
What?

24
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.440
We start this.

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.000
And this is going to take us to the customer login screen and we just have to wait for this.

26
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.320
Okay.

27
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.400
Back to.

28
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.010
The customer the longest screen.

29
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.300
We then have to get rid of what we do not need.

30
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.930
Okay.

31
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.920
Now we basically are not going to be able to pick a match because we just want to be able to log in.

32
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.300
So we do not need the psycho avatar, the camera gallery and sort.

33
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.050
So first of all, we can get rid of this pig image from Gallery.

34
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.190
And over here we are calling that function.

35
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.090
So we're going to have this error so we can as well get rid of this.

36
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.920
And we do not really need to pick image from gallery because sorry from camera because we just want

37
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.730
to log in.

38
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.240
And over here.

39
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.400
Let's.

40
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.670
And.

41
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.670
This is the function to sign up users, right?

42
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.340
We basically do not need this because we had already signed up.

43
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.420
And now we can get rid of this over here.

44
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.570
Okay.

45
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.000
And.

46
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.440
Get rid of this variable called this global variable.

47
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.540
And we can look for where we are, isn't it?

48
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.930
And we basically do not need this security.

49
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.430
Right?

50
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.110
So we need to get rid of this.

51
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.620
So it starts from here and it.

52
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.460
Right.

53
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.800
Get rid of it is contrary and save.

54
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.780
And this should be gone.

55
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.890
This should be gone now.

56
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.280
We have orders that I think this is okay, it's gone, and we have to get rid of this column.

57
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.640
Right.

58
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.090
Okay.

59
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.800
It starts here and.

60
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.830
And.

61
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.520
Where else?

62
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.270
Here, within the colon.

63
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.380
We basically had to contain our right so we can get rid of the full colon.

64
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.600
So this is going to get rid of.

65
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.600
This via.

66
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.110
Gets rid of it.

67
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.860
Okay.

68
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.680
And now we can change this to say login to customize account.

69
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.370
Or we can just say sign in or probably we can just go with sign in.

70
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.320
Should be okay.

71
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.730
Sign in to customers accounts.

72
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.490
This country has to save.

73
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.490
And you're going to see to via sign into customers account.

74
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.650
And we do not need the full name field, so we need to get rid of that.

75
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.740
So over the phone, this is the test from field and it's ends over.

76
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.120
Yeah.

77
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.180
Get rid of it.

78
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.650
Okay.

79
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.610
It should be gone by now.

80
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.690
It's gone.

81
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.090
And I think this place is okay.

82
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.150
This is the size box separating this and.

83
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.780
What we have over here.

84
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.180
Great.

85
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.160
We have to rename this test to say log in or sign in or we can just log in or whatever you desire.

86
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.400
Okay.

87
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.760
That test.

88
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.450
Did she say?

89
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.330
Log in.

90
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.290
You can try to save.

91
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.410
And you're going to see it via.

92
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.970
Over.

93
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.740
Yeah.

94
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.240
Log in and already have an account.

95
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.330
This should then say sign up.

96
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.480
Already have an account.

97
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.100
And I should say.

98
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.410
Sign up.

99
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.620
This country needs to save.

100
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.920
Okay.

101
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.380
Okay.

102
00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.250
Great.

103
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.760
This is basically it.

104
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.670
Right now we have two fields.

105
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.820
The email and the password.

106
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.040
Right.

107
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.130
Okay.

108
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.170
Sounds good.

109
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.160
And if we do not have if we already have an account we want to go to.

110
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.580
The sign up screen so we can just create that function now.

111
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.240
Okay.

112
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.160
So over.

113
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.290
Yeah.

114
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.620
The test button.

115
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.350
We can then say navigator.

116
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.150
Navigator.

117
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.440
Dot of contest.

118
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.370
And darts.

119
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.240
Push.

120
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.780
Want to push?

121
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.940
So another page.

122
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.170
And for the root.

123
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.990
This is something known as Materia.

124
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.310
Marty.

125
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.220
We are page roots for the builder.

126
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.700
This is going to take in something known as contest.

127
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.880
And most of the time we really do not need to specify, but we can just specify.

128
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.280
This contest is something known as build contest.

129
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.840
I think you've seen this before, the beauty contest.

130
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.470
Okay.

131
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.560
And now we have to create a functional barrier.

132
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.520
And we just want to return to.

133
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.050
The way we call this.

134
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.350
London.

135
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.130
Is going to take what I called this what we learned the customer screen.

136
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.350
The customer screened OC.

137
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.530
I had your semi-colon as well.

138
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.960
I can use control and save.

139
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.480
And now if we.

140
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.770
You have an account?

141
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.950
We just want to.

142
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.330
Sorry.

143
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.860
If we do not have an account, we just want to sign up.

144
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.800
Sorry.

145
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.920
I think we have to restart this.

146
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.730
And that should be it.

147
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.950
Okay.

148
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.400
We just have to wait.

149
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.760
I think it's taking longer than expected, but.

150
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.250
We still have to wait for this and.

151
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.180
Everything is going to work as planned.

152
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.880
Okay.

153
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.650
This is taking longer.

154
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.450
Probably I'm going to leave this for you to do this yourself or to test this yourself.

155
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.710
Okay.

156
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.450
Take longer.

157
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.380
Look, we're just going to continue from here and in this lecture.

158
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.440
Okay, guys, see you at the next lecture.
