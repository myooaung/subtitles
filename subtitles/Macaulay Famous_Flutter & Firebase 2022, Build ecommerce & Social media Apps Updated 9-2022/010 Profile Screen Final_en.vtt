00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.240
In this lecture, we're going to have a circle avatar over here, and it says over here, which is going

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.430
to say, guest.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.040
Okay, now, in order to do this, we have to go back to our visa code and we are going to search for

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.520
that property, which is known as the ground.

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.910
That ground.

8
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.670
Okay, over here we can see we have this background and the widget is a container.

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.820
And as you know, the container has a property which is known as Tide.

10
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:43.390
And with what I just said, I said we are going to have two widgets that is the circle of water and

11
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
it says widgets, which is going to say guess.

12
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.310
And with my explanation, you can see it's going to be displayed horizontally.

13
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.070
That is from left to right.

14
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.110
So for this purpose, we are going to be using a row widget.

15
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.320
And as you know, the row can take multiple widgets.

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.640
We can just add the two over there and the first child is going to be a circle.

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.850
Circle Avatar.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.830
And as you know, the circle avatar.

19
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.550
Has a radius property which is our big.

20
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.840
We want the radios to be all around.

21
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.030
We want the radius to be where we can just do it.

22
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.900
We can get rid of that and just say background, color and colors that maybe seen.

23
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.480
Or we can just get rid of this first and use control and let's save and see what's going to look like.

24
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.700
Okay.

25
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.860
You're going to say it over here.

26
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.760
You can see.

27
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.770
Okay.

28
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.420
And now what we can do, we can then say radius of maybe 50 additional comma and use control and s to

29
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.020
save.

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.100
Okay.

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.220
It's going to be more bigger.

32
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.660
Okay.

33
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.450
You can see.

34
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.860
Looking great, right?

35
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.700
Okay.

36
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.340
And what we can then do is the circle hover.

37
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.890
Terror has a property known as background color and also background image.

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.460
Okay.

39
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.850
We can just go with the background image for the background image.

40
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.950
We are going to go to our files and I'm going to copy.

41
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.530
I'm want to copy this.

42
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.980
This image I think I have.

43
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.390
An image which is similar is going to look for it quickly.

44
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.970
And this is it over here with the copy this or cards and go to the next stop and I'm going to search

45
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.110
for my.

46
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.110
The project name.

47
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.440
Multi-vendor and.

48
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.660
This is going to be this image is going to be the resource.

49
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.660
So you can go download it and.

50
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.580
Assets.

51
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.430
Okay.

52
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.660
We can just create.

53
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.000
They knew for the record images right then we the images we can then create a new photo again and we're

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.180
going to call this up on the score logo.

55
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.780
Like to make it cleaner and we have to pace this year and now we have to point this location to to that

56
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.730
we can use culture and be okay to make this smaller and this is it assets.

57
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.980
So assess images and have logo.

58
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.710
So we have to go to the main or that file.

59
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.830
Meaning that you can see these assets over here.

60
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.190
So what we can do is we can uncomment this is going to screw up to get the relocation.

61
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.420
Okay.

62
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:55.600
The location of this, before you get to this images, you will first need to access the assets, then

63
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.350
images, right.

64
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.690
Then Harp on the score logo.

65
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.280
And then slash the name of the image is guessed.

66
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.850
Guest dot jpg.

67
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.530
Okay, we can then get rid of this and.

68
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.209
Use control necessary.

69
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.740
We can just copy this part.

70
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.839
Right, because you're going to use it over there.

71
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.690
Well, okay.

72
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.310
We waited for this before.

73
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.440
Then we can just continue.

74
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.630
Okay.

75
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.310
And back to Surrey.

76
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.280
Hopefully I did not drag anything wrongly.

77
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.250
Okay.

78
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.170
I'm just going to wait for this.

79
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.410
Okay.

80
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.310
Sorry, sir.

81
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.520
Then back to the profile screen.

82
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.590
I think I would have done this behind the scenes.

83
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.190
Close this and.

84
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.660
Okay.

85
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.150
And now for the background image, we have to say.

86
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.850
He made Dodds.

87
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.310
Image.

88
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.370
Sorry, there's going to be assets.

89
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.090
Assets.

90
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.950
Image.

91
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.860
Assets.

92
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.440
Image.

93
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.960
Assets.

94
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.700
Image.

95
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.230
And we have to piss this.

96
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.680
So control this wide and and this.

97
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.700
Hopefully I copied it.

98
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.500
We're just going to copy it again quickly.

99
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.790
Okay.

100
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.260
Pulse back.

101
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.690
Copy.

102
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.790
I can just get it ticket to make sure the package has been added or the image has been added back to

103
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.500
the profile screen and.

104
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.350
Is this?

105
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.150
Okay.

106
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.900
Seems good, right?

107
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.820
Okay.

108
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.620
Okay.

109
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.160
You're going to get it one more time.

110
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.880
It's true.

111
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.050
And that's a save.

112
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.700
And get this one more time.

113
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.190
That is why most of the time I have to restart my vehicle.

114
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.950
Okay.

115
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.890
Is already there.

116
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.090
Okay.

117
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.870
Simms Good.

118
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.510
Adina after we stopped by vesicles.

119
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.420
So now we can continue and get rid of this.

120
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.570
And this is the first child of the row.

121
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.250
And we can have another which is going to be a test which at.

122
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.370
And Capito ed is going to say guest and we can tie this.

123
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.100
STI sti.

124
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.380
Sorry.

125
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.020
STI.

126
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.350
And test tie.

127
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.820
To start.

128
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.700
Test.

129
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.880
So test.

130
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.790
Style, we can increase the font size.

131
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.190
225.

132
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.140
Added comma and we can change the colour.

133
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.440
Two colors that white.

134
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.830
And you can try and save and go check it out.

135
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:30.300
Look, you can see over here now we can give a space between boats that is this and this.

136
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.600
So what we can just do.

137
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.790
We can use this size box for this.

138
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.850
Or we can just use a paddle.

139
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.310
But what we can just do we can use a size box for this, and we are giving this space horizontally.

140
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.240
So this is going to be width and we can see width of maybe 25.

141
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.390
And I'll come over there and see.

142
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.030
Okay.

143
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.250
Great.

144
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.100
And we can give space over this as well.

145
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:04.260
And to do that, what we can just do we can wrap this with the padding, maybe padding here, and we

146
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.200
can give for maybe all sides.

147
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.640
Or 15 and see.

148
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.190
Okay.

149
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.310
And see if it's okay.

150
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:13.680
Okay.

151
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:19.720
I think this is looking great and I think it's looking great.

152
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.480
And I think it took a bit time to do this.

153
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.640
And this is because of the image.

154
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.580
So what we basically did was to create.

155
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.130
A new territory court.

156
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.280
Images we send the assets, right.

157
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:40.400
And in order to make our code more cleaner, because we are going to have a lot of images.

158
00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:50.240
So we created a new folder basically for the help logos or the logos that's going to be related to all

159
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.390
the hub, all the images that's going to be related to logos.

160
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.880
We have to create a new folder for it.

161
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.740
And currently we have this guest dot jpg and after doing this.

162
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.960
We have to tell to, hey, we just added something to our we just added an image.

163
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.270
So what we basically did was to point the location to that image, right?

164
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.910
Images have a little app on the scroll logo and you can see it is the same way to assess it.

165
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.740
Assets, images up on the school logo and then the name of the image.

166
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.370
And over here we are basically using that image.

167
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.470
Right.

168
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.360
We are basically having access to the location again via well before you need to do this, you must

169
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.090
have it in your bag.

170
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.010
That's fine.

171
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:47.940
That is, you must have told Prospect Odhiambo Fi that, hey, I have had a footer or I've had a defy,

172
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.130
so please take note of this.

173
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:56.870
Okay, so this is what we're basically doing and hopefully you understand it's okay.

174
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.810
Seems good, right?

175
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.420
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
