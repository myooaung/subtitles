00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.830
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.810
Now, like, that's all the talk.

4
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.350
We are also going to have the profile for two of our year, but this time around is gonna keep on continuously

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.410
circling.

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.720
Okay, not to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VSC court.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.270
And you can see over here we have the last column, which is for this share.

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.640
Which we took the reply and this test.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.810
And over here we have the overall column.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.940
And the reason for this is because we want all ads that are going to go inside it to be displayed what

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.800
vertically that is from top to bottom.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.820
And you can see over here we have the main elements and we are saying we want to space this evenly.

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.930
So you can see over here this widget and this widget and this widget has because space, you can see

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.520
the space and this space and this space.

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.850
Okay.

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.110
So now to do this, we can basically do this right after.

17
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.599
This last hole, you can see its pants.

18
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.319
Yeah.

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.190
Okay.

20
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.880
Well, we're going to be within the main column, right?

21
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.290
Okay.

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.790
So not to do this, we can basically do this right after they're all we can do is we can have a more

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.680
smoke cleaner code.

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.120
Okay.

25
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.480
So after the screen, sorry, not after, but within the screens, we are going to create a new for

26
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.840
the adorable codes for the widgets.

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.580
So widgets.

28
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.010
Okay.

29
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.160
And over this widgets we can then create a new flag and they're going to call this circle or this cool

30
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.940
animation.

31
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.960
Okay.

32
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.710
On the animation and the station, go dark.

33
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.820
Okay.

34
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.100
Now all we want is a minute.

35
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.320
The user visits this screen.

36
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.120
We want the profile to keep on continuously sick leave.

37
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.650
Okay.

38
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.900
That's is immediately to use our visitors screen.

39
00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.380
Okay.

40
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.640
Not to do this.

41
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.520
Going to abuse.

42
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.190
Using something known.

43
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.740
Asked what's in these states and that's using this state are going to be needing to use the stateful

44
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.550
widgets okay as well we can call this circle circle on the.

45
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.590
And the nation.

46
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.310
Okay.

47
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.340
Now we need to highlight and there is quantum dots in other parts, the material that that package.

48
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.700
Okay.

49
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.300
Okay.

50
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.350
So let's see.

51
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.170
Okay.

52
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.090
Now, the first thing we need to do is a set of the animation settings.

53
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.500
Okay.

54
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.160
So over here, we can create a little rainbow to see if we want to do this at this moment.

55
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.040
And, of course, we have a controller, and now we can just specify the type of rainbow.

56
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.690
Is this type of on the mission controller.

57
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.920
Okay.

58
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.030
Okay.

59
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.830
And now what we want to do is munity.

60
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.060
These are visit this screen.

61
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.920
We then want to do something.

62
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.990
So where you are going to be in the United States.

63
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.700
And.

64
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.870
Over here, we can then give this variable a value.

65
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.690
Controller is going to be equal to the on the.

66
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.470
Mission.

67
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.010
Controller.

68
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.540
Okay.

69
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.410
Now you can see it has a property known as V Sink and it's going to be referring to this class.

70
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.710
Okay, then notice, is this the effect of this class?

71
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.770
All we can do is over here.

72
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.160
You're going to need to see.

73
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.760
Single.

74
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.110
Teacup provider statesman.

75
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.580
If you don't know what this does.

76
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.070
Just know you need this basically to use animation.

77
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.590
Okay.

78
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.070
And as well this.

79
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.100
And Mission Control has a property known as duration.

80
00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.790
Okay.

81
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.010
It's going to be duration.

82
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.870
Duration.

83
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.650
Okay.

84
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.830
Now, we can't just say no sitcoms.

85
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.130
So milliseconds, not microseconds.

86
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.340
You can as well say minutes.

87
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.390
Okay, we can just say 5000.

88
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.850
Okay.

89
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.180
Addition of agitator, cover and use, control and save.

90
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.900
Okay as well.

91
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.920
We can.

92
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.910
Then say controller.

93
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.660
With in, is that right?

94
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.830
Okay, Controller.

95
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.830
Controller touch forward.

96
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.510
And we also want to repeat it the comptroller.

97
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.430
Dutch we get.

98
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.110
Okay, Controller.

99
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.400
Dodge.

100
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.660
We?

101
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.210
Pete.

102
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.500
Okay.

103
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.670
Okay.

104
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.630
Great.

105
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.810
Now.

106
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.040
This is okay now.

107
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.690
Is it not written in a container?

108
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.050
They're going to return something to us.

109
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.600
I think it's called real.

110
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.940
Rotation.

111
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.950
Transaction.

112
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.460
Yeah.

113
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.660
Okay.

114
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.660
Now, this rotation transaction has a required property known as.

115
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.290
So since we can see, we want to use that swing animation.

116
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.910
Swing.

117
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.470
Okay.

118
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.320
And now we can specify how we want this animation to start by saying Begin.

119
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.850
And it has to double.

120
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.870
So it's going to be zero.

121
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:50.330
I want you to start from the 0.0 and ends in 1.0.

122
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.840
Okay.

123
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.460
And over here, we need to see dogs on the inmates.

124
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.210
Okay.

125
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.340
Then pass in that controller cable.

126
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.870
We just created.

127
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.210
Okay, Controller.

128
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.230
Okay.

129
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.070
Controller.

130
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.340
Okay, great.

131
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.720
Okay.

132
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:17.150
And now all we can do is within this rotation, it has the child property as well for the child.

133
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.430
We can make this a bit dynamic.

134
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.570
So whenever we call the second mission, we're going to need to pass in the value.

135
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.500
So over here we need to say finer and this is going to be a type of widget that is going to need to

136
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.110
pass a value which is going to be a type of widget.

137
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.260
And we can call this child.

138
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.560
Okay.

139
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.470
And now we can alight and use control dots.

140
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.300
Create constructs for final fields.

141
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.770
And you can see he's already required you for any reason.

142
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.940
You don't have this required.

143
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.890
You can just add it yourself.

144
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.530
Okay.

145
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.740
And for this ability to pass in the child.

146
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.280
Was in.

147
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.140
Okay.

148
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.980
Which side?

149
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.230
Okay.

150
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.300
Okay.

151
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.270
So now that's I says this, you can see this is a top level table.

152
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.570
So we need to see which adds.

153
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.400
That's child.

154
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.340
Okay.

155
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.000
Great.

156
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.760
Now we can use control necessary.
