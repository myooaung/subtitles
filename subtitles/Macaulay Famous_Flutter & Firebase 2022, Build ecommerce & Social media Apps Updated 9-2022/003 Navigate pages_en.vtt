00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.750
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.370
Now, when we click on any of this, we want to be able to navigate to that page.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.300
Okay.

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.220
But what we're going to do first is we're going to make all this clickable.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
You can see for now is not clickable to do this.

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.120
First of all, since we're going to be updating the UI, what we can do is to convert this, that,

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.410
this.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.360
We get to a state for widgets.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.500
And to do that, all you just have to do is to, first of all, are light and use control dots.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.970
They're going to click on convert to state for widget.

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.530
Okay, great.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
Now what they're going to do next is they're going to make all this icons clickable.

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.500
You can see it is not clickable.

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.820
So to do this.

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.880
I got keep track of the current page we are in.

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:05.349
So over the states they're going to create a variable called variable page, enhance the we are going

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.590
to set it to zero, which should be the whole page because that is the starting point.

19
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.780
Now we can set it data type or it's which is in normal.

20
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.200
Right.

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.650
Okay.

22
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.420
Now this Copaxone has something called on top.

23
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.180
That is once it is stopped dead or to create a function.

24
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.260
Okay.

25
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.710
Now we're going to pass in indents over here.

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.230
Then.

27
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.100
They're going to sit states.

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.030
Like I said, they're going to be audited.

29
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080
You are going to see said state.

30
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.960
Let's think.

31
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.270
Conservatives now recognize a page.

32
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.240
This is going to be equal to the.

33
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.110
In this.

34
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.420
I just live there.

35
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.590
Okay.

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.390
Now, this is going to keep track of the current page we are currently in.

37
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.530
There's going to have to.

38
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.730
Okay.

39
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.390
So now to finally see this in action, we announced to save this to.

40
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.570
That's going to work.

41
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.740
Okay.

42
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.070
To finally see this in action.

43
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.840
What you can do as well.

44
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.730
It also has.

45
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.500
The Coloreds index.

46
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.900
That is a current page we are in so we can see page.

47
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.660
Page in this.

48
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.130
So currently we are in the whole page.

49
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.490
Right.

50
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.780
Okay.

51
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.770
Now we can.

52
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.410
Okay.

53
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.120
You can see.

54
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.630
Great.

55
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.170
Okay.

56
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.170
Now, what you're going to do next is we're going to be able to navigate to different pages now for

57
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.890
the now I just going to add this dummy data.

58
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.750
So what I can do.

59
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.360
You can create a variable called pages that we can say is equal to a list.

60
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.960
Okay.

61
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.030
It's going to be fine available, right?

62
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.530
Okay.

63
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.610
So they're going to have the first test, which is going to represent the home for now.

64
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.240
Okay.

65
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.640
So we are going to see home page.

66
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.080
Okay.

67
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.440
I've just got to copy this.

68
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.340
For copyright pieces for what time?

69
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.740
So there's going to be two, then two and four and five.

70
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.980
So it is going to be the search.

71
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.050
Age.

72
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.610
I said customise the third icon above to use user customize icon.

73
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.500
So we're just going to leave DOT.

74
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.910
So this is going to be a message page and the last is going to be the profile.

75
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.130
Page.

76
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.810
Okay.

77
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.270
Sorry.

78
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.230
Okay.

79
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.100
Adios.

80
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.340
Silver.

81
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.500
Colon, or are you okay?

82
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.810
Now, the nurse saying they're going to do is they'll use this page variable.

83
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.210
So to simply do that, you're just going to remove this test widget.

84
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.510
Then we'll call that page pages.

85
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.930
There's a little pass in the page index, which is going to be zero.

86
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.890
Hard to spot.

87
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.960
That is the whole page.

88
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.650
Okay.

89
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.620
Now, when they use control and has to save.

90
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.840
Then go check it out.

91
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.770
You can see my AK Steel reloaded.

92
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.720
Okay.

93
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.780
Now, right now we are in the homepage.

94
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.130
Right.

95
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.910
You can see it over there.

96
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.430
Now you can see it as well.

97
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.340
Change to the search page.

98
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.720
You can see it over there.

99
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.500
The message page as well.

100
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.560
Now, before we had this lecture, please note a variety of ways to do this as well.

101
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.210
I think this is the most easy approach.

102
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.510
First of all.

103
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:32.600
We created a verbal code page in this, which we said, which we said is equal to zero, which should

104
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.340
be the whole page.

105
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.730
Right.

106
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:44.090
And over here we simply use the on top that we passed in the index, which is going to keep track of

107
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.070
the page we are currently in.

108
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.940
We said if it is stopped once we stop or sort did the UI to the.

109
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.600
To the number that is.

110
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.850
So, as you can see, this is zero.

111
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.510
This is why.

112
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.230
This is true.

113
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.980
This is true.

114
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.090
This is for.

115
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.650
So this is a zero.

116
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.750
This is a starting point.

117
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.290
Okay.

118
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.550
So although we also passed in the current index, those is the page index, which is a starting point

119
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.000
of zero.

120
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.160
That is the whole page.

121
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.640
Okay.

122
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.530
So there we are, just using it as a variable.

123
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.510
Then we are passing the page in.

124
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.090
Does so for the first time.

125
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.310
This is going to be zero.

126
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.630
Right.

127
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.900
So it is click again when you click on this he's going to object to.

128
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.280
One.

129
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.510
And so on.

130
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.720
So that was why we used this state as pass in the in this.

131
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.630
But we are so close in this.

132
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:58.540
And as of now, in order to get our code more cleaner, what you can just do is to cut this out of here.

133
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.740
Okay.

134
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.990
Now, we are going to go to the.

135
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.740
Caused.

136
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.860
Okay.

137
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.180
Now what you can do.

138
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.830
You can just do it over here.

139
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.640
Then we can use a comment for us.

140
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.940
So.

141
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.160
So.

142
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.620
Comments because the list includes capitalism for this list of.

143
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.530
Hedges.

144
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.310
We have.

145
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.110
Okay, great.

146
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.910
Now, here's this.

147
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.350
Okay.

148
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.150
Let's think.

149
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.580
Okay.

150
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.340
We just got these controllers to save.

151
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.730
And control NASA unnecessary as well.

152
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.770
Okay.

153
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.850
So whenever it gets a okay.

154
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.200
Okay.

155
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.620
Good.

156
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.200
To walk in now.

157
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.620
We don't.

158
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.750
We're never to have in this record.

159
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.340
Okay.

160
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.570
Okay, guys.

161
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.540
See you in an.
