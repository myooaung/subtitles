00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.590
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.170
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.140
Now, in this lecture, we're going to redesign off screen.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.240
Now, what you can do over here.

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.210
Now we can use Control V to make this smaller.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.160
Now very hot footer.

7
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.120
We can see we can see the hot footer once again.

8
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.020
Just do that.

9
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.610
Two seats over the screen.

10
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.980
We can just create a new Phi and call this Phi probably sign.

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.710
I've just got to give it like this.

12
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.340
Okay.

13
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.910
I want still hot for that typed up here.

14
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.189
So that was the reason I did something like this.

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.980
So now over this odd footer are going to create a new FY and over call this FY sign up.

16
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.930
Dot, dot.

17
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.590
Okay.

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.250
Now, if for any reason this sign off is not the same structure, you can easily just move this to the

19
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.910
odd footer.

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.950
Now we are going to delete this.

21
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.610
Okay.

22
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.090
Good.

23
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.959
Now the sign of the that fi what we can do we can use is tip this widget.

24
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.290
S t l that this widget as well.

25
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.770
Call this sign up.

26
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.710
Okay.

27
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.980
Now, over here are the needs control and that supports the material that that package.

28
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.220
Okay.

29
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.540
Control and Dot.

30
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.630
Okay.

31
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.750
Great.

32
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.580
If we turn in the container, we can reach on the scaffold.

33
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.610
So we have access to lots of properties.

34
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.270
Okay.

35
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.660
So we're going to have lots of lots of questions, right?

36
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.250
Okay.

37
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.340
Now I'm going to say, buddy, okay, this is going to be a container.

38
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.590
Okay.

39
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.340
Container.

40
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.680
Okay, great.

41
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.460
We're going to go to our slogans before they we're going to lose control and ask to save everybody.

42
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.450
Log in screen.

43
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.130
What we can do.

44
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.449
We can see if they click on the register test.

45
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.949
Want to have your time.

46
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.620
I think we have this before.

47
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.590
From that, basically they decided, okay, on top.

48
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.770
Okay.

49
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.850
Great.

50
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.790
Should have this in already.

51
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.160
So now you're going to see Navigator.

52
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.660
Navigator sort of contest the Dutch.

53
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.910
Whoosh.

54
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.370
Okay, now this is going to be my Syria page.

55
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.510
ROBERTS okay.

56
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.060
Great for the DEA.

57
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.800
There is going to be contest.

58
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.210
They were using their function.

59
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.500
Then we can call that sign up page.

60
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.840
You can see the sign up page.

61
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.100
Okay.

62
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.910
Great.

63
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.890
Or trying to save or just to start this.

64
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.510
Okay.

65
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.480
Okay.

66
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.070
Bleak on the surface.

67
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.380
Okay, great.

68
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.550
Okay, now, for the sake of mastery, you're gonna do this from scratch.

69
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.080
So what I can do, first of all, I'm going to give it to the camera.

70
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.310
Okay.

71
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.170
Now we're going to see a child.

72
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.020
The child is going to be a column which says we're going to render all our widgets vertically.

73
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.890
That is from top.

74
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.770
From top to bottom.

75
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.160
Right.

76
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.260
So this is going to be called.

77
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.920
Okay.

78
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.220
Now we are going to have what's it for widget so it has the children property so the first child is

79
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.830
going to be it says field.

80
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.480
Okay.

81
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.680
I said, it's going to look like you got this religious confidence.

82
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.250
Okay.

83
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.840
So now you're going to have the decoration that's going to be the MP.

84
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.339
It's decoration.

85
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.630
Okay.

86
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.399
To contribute to make this way.

87
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.480
Okay.

88
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.630

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.550
Right.

92
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.100
Okay.

93
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.130
I try to cover.

94
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.930
Okay.

95
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.160
Go check it out.

96
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.880
Okay.

97
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.330
Good.

98
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.310
Now we can give it test.

99
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.860
All right.

100
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.630
Which is more like a place order.

101
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.750
You start doing CCS at the Oyster Bar.

102
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.630
Okay.

103
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.290
There's going to be.

104
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.560
Means test of user name first.

105
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.340
Okay.

106
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.840
Go check it out.

107
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.170
Okay.

108
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.860
Now, what we can do over this column we can see made us this eloquent.

109
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.410
With us is I love wines.

110
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.700
The center.

111
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.530
Okay.

112
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.350
Go check it out.

113
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.020
Okay.

114
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.770
Great.

115
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.030
Now you can see.

116
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.660
It's just too straight.

117
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.020
So now what you can do, we can give you whatever security you can give us like this or what they give

118
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.010
you for their videos.

119
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.870
So over here, we're going to see whether videos is going to be to.

120
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.390
Videos that secular of 20 journalists to save.

121
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.260
Okay.

122
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.450
You're trying to cover is true and.

123
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.800
Yes.

124
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.750
Okay, great.

125
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.240
Okay.

126
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.010
Now what you can do.

127
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.740
We can wrap this with the pods over this container.

128
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.870
We can see a pattern.

129
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.780
It's going to be edge insets.

130
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.990
As in said study hall that is for all sides or to give is face of 20.

131
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.200
Okay.

132
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.080
Great.

133
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.800
Now what you can do now?

134
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.840
I think you should have my studies.

135
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.910
I can copy this test field.

136
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.200
Okay.

137
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.420
First of all, you're going to give space to this test shoot at a distance view, and I'm going to give

138
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.410
this physiologically.

139
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.390
So you're going to have a size books.

140
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.340
Of.

141
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.460
Height of sweetie.

142
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.420
Okay.

143
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.480
Attitude, coma.

144
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.810
They're going to face this well before David was able to have a privacy icon.

145
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.190
So I'm going to say peripheries.

146
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.550
Icon is going to be icon widgets.

147
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.800
That is going to be.

148
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.630
I can't start.

149
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.730
Preston.

150
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.480
For us and for us.

151
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.850
Sorry, those two sent for us.

152
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.880
Okay.

153
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.430
Good.

154
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.050
So is it a user name?

155
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.150
It is going to be email.

156
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.450
And also we're going to have the crew freeze icon is going to be icon.

157
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.990
It is going to be icons that email.

158
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.640
Okay.

159
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.720
Great.

160
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.620
Okay.

161
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.470
Go check it out.

162
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.330
Okay.

163
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.430
Now, as for the password.

164
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.870
Right.

165
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.510
So over this test field.

166
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.910
They're going to have a sizable house again.

167
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.270
And that's it.

168
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.070
That's just okay.

169
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.830
It was going to be height of 20 as well.

170
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.060
Okay.

171
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.710
The commodities.

172
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.900
This is going to be.

173
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.390
Password.

174
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.930
Okay.

175
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.810
Now we can we have the icon is going to be icon.

176
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.330
Then there's going to be icons.

177
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.050
Dot lock.

178
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.580
Right.

179
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:11.840
Okay.

180
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.480
Okay.

181
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.020
Great.

182
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.450
Go check it out.

183
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.600
Okay, great.

184
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:31.870
Now, on your whole, what they're going to do is to heart that register protein, and that is to swish

185
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.720
what this that your test is going to a need.

186
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:42.780
So we already have an account that is going to take that user to the login page.

187
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.140
So you get that done yourself.

188
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.930
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
