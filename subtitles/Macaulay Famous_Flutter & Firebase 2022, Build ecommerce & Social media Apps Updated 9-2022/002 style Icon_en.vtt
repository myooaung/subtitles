00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.630
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.860
In this picture, we are going to say this icon to look exactly like this.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.910
Okay, now, if you able to do it, congrats.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.730
Okay.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.320
Now to do this, you're going to need to go back to this.

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.740
You could.

8
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay.

9
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.440
Now, one of the reason we have to use the container was because we want to have access to lots of properties,

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.440
such as the decoration.

11
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.040
And then the box decoration.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.690
Right.

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.170
Okay.

14
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.370
So now we can see color is going to be colors dark, black.

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.590
Okay.

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.300
Is control and is safe and good.

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.960
Check it out.

18
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.180
Okay.

19
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.080
You can see it.

20
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.840
You can see it is not set in the moment.

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.860
So what are you going to need to do is you're going to change this color so you can see color is going

22
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.670
to colors.

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.440
Dot what?

24
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.580
Okay.

25
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.460
Is this a save and go check it out.

26
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.700
Okay, great.

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.030
Now you can make this path around that ship.

28
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.400
So a lot of buzz decoration.

29
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.510
We can see, by the way, this is going to be what our videos.

30
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.400
Thou art secular of that that is our road is going to be.

31
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.410
You can see 2010.

32
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.530
The void is going to go with it.

33
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.110
Okay.

34
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.410
I did.

35
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.230
I did.

36
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.050
You recover and then use control and that's the safe and go take it out.

37
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.560
Okay.

38
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.370
Great.

39
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.010
Now you can give pardon to this container.

40
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.440
So where can dance parties?

41
00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.830
It's going to be at it said that's all that is all four sites you can do it by the end of ten.

42
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.420
Okay.

43
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.990
I tried to save all those, and maybe that's I could try to cover.

44
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.259
So it gets formatted for you.

45
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.200
Okay, great.

46
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.080
And I think this is way too bleak, right?

47
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.950
We can just use it.

48
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.000
Or probably.

49
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.640
Five.

50
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.480
Okay.

51
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.290
Go check it out.

52
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.760
As I keep trying it out to give your taste.

53
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.400
Okay.

54
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.770
I think this viewer is just small, right?

55
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.200
Again, I think there is no space.

56
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.290
Okay, let's go and check off our products.

57
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.980
Okay.

58
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.200
Right.

59
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.600
Okay.

60
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.420
So all we can do is compare it with this.

61
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.450
Okay, so first of all, you're gonna need to give space between this and this.

62
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.190
So to do that.

63
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.410
This is the test we did.

64
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.840
It ends here.

65
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.590
Right.

66
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.300
And this is the other widgets.

67
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.880
Right.

68
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.650
So now we have at least something known as the five bucks.

69
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.770
Right.

70
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.720
Original cover.

71
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.490
Now we're going to be given the space.

72
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.030
We're gonna be given the space.

73
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.340
Horizontally.

74
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100
That is from left to right.

75
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.060
You can see both.

76
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.480
I've been this video recently.

77
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.950
So for that, I'm going to be using words a bit so you can give it a space of ten days as to check.

78
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.250
It does first to see if it works right.

79
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.700
Okay.

80
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.120
Go check it out.

81
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.740
Okay.

82
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.370
Great.

83
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.220
Right.

84
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.220
So now what else can we do to this?

85
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.140
We can then give a side to this test.

86
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.190
Stay.

87
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.170
Okay.

88
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.040
We can't give a font size.

89
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.790
It is what they have created.

90
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.310
It says to probably it's in.

91
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.740
Right.

92
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.360
Then we can as well say find.

93
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.650
Font.

94
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.650
Just see what this does first.

95
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.000
Okay.

96
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.500
Okay.

97
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.940
Great.

98
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.250
Now we can make it both.

99
00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.730
So you're going to see the foreign tweets for.

100
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.540
We.

101
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.880
Don't put.

102
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.770
Okay, there.

103
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.750
This content is safe and go check it out.

104
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.540
Great.

105
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.950
Hopefully is looking just like this and hopefully you can do this now.

106
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.080
If you are not able to.

107
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.360
Right.

108
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.600
Okay.

109
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.990
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
