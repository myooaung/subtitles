00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.890
Workroom.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.150
In this lecture, you're going to need to create the Google sign in method.

4
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
Okay, not to do this, we're going to need to go to our controllers directory.

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.050
Remember, our controllers directory is where we're going to be creating all our logics.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.500
Right.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.890
Okay.

8
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.020
So over this cultural as directory, you're going to create a new PHI, and so we're going to call this

9
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.490
Phi What's.

10
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.180
What's.

11
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.020
On the score.

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.040
Sorry.

13
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.290
Art on the score controller and then the section dot.

14
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.730
Dot.

15
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.340
Okay.

16
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.990
We can use control and beat to make this work.

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.390
Okay.

18
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.730
Now, the first step we're going to take is we're going to create a class and as well we can call this

19
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.680
what's controller?

20
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.420
Okay.

21
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.410
And now we are going to create a function to assign end users using the Google sign in return.

22
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.950
So we're just gonna call this function sign in weeds.

23
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.140
Google.

24
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.000
Okay.

25
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.160
Now, this is going to take some time.

26
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.620
So it's going to take in something known as ASAP.

27
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.510
Okay, great.

28
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.530
Okay then.

29
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.570
And that's a sign in users, we're going to be using the package, which we recently started known as

30
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.440
Firebase Arts.

31
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.850
So if I yeah, we can initialize it so we can create a finite and we can call this ODS, there's going

32
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.470
to be equal to firebase.

33
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.170
Or it's.

34
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.340
Dot is tense.

35
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.750
Okay, great.

36
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.010
Now we can as well specify the type of variable is the type of base heart rate.

37
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.300
Okay, great.

38
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.240
Great.

39
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.160
Okay.

40
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.650
And now we can sign in the user to sign in the user using Google.

41
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.670
All we just have to say is fine and we can store the results in a verbal card.

42
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.780
Google.

43
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.440
User.

44
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.790
And all we just have to say is equal to the Google package we installed.

45
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.780
Google sign in.

46
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.190
Yeah.

47
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.420
Then Dot.

48
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.009
Dodds.

49
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.009
Sign in.

50
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.870
Okay, so by doing this, we're going to sign in the user.

51
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.560
But the only issue is whether we'll have access to the user's detail.

52
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.590
Right.

53
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.980
We're just gonna sign in the user.

54
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.330
But we.

55
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.030
I never know.

56
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.090
We just recently signed in a user since we're not going to have access to the details.

57
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.450
Okay.

58
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.700
Now via we can specify the type of label is a type of Google.

59
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.790
Google sign in account.

60
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.110
Okay.

61
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.260
Over here, we can add this check to say it can be null and as well it's going to take some time so

62
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.330
we can then how we see it.

63
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.860
Okay.

64
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.750
Okay.

65
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.780
So, yeah, this is all we need in order to sign in.

66
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.270
A user using the Google.

67
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.290
Okay, well, the only issue is we're not going to have access to the user details as we cannot save

68
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.360
the user details to our database.

69
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.720
Okay.

70
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.780
So what we're going to do is we're going to need to have access to the user details because as well,

71
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.200
we're going to store the user details in our database.

72
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.470
Right.

73
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.830
Okay.

74
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.670
So now to do that, first of all, we need to check if the user is authenticated.

75
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.040
That is, if the user is either logged in or not.

76
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.430
Okay.

77
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.350
So to do that, we are going to create a variable to store the results.

78
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.850
Google Arts.

79
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.800
Then we can say it quartz.

80
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.190
You remember this is the variable to sign in user, right?

81
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.840
So currently this has access to the sign in user.

82
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.170
Right.

83
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.930
So you can then see Google.

84
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.710
Google user that is available DOT authentication.

85
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.100
Okay.

86
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.550
So you are simply checking if the user is wanted to get it or not.

87
00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.390
Over here we have had this logic and over here it wants us to specify the type of variable.

88
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.250
Okay.

89
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.330
So we can say is a type of Google.

90
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.890
Okay.

91
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.820
This is a type of Google sign in.

92
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.690
Or execution.

93
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.140
Okay.

94
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.899
Okay.

95
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.900
As all we can say.

96
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.040
FINA.

97
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.990
Okay.

98
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.590
Although it is going to take some time so we can therefore have weights.

99
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.360
Okay, great.

100
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.650
So if year.

101
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.410
We signed in the user.

102
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.970
And over here we are checking if the user is authenticated or not.

103
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.480
That is if the user is logged in or not.

104
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.950
Okay.

105
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.400
Okay.

106
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.490
Or if the user was successfully signed in.

107
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.960
Okay.

108
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.210
Okay.

109
00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.270
Now, what we're going to need to do now is to have access to the user conditions because they're going

110
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.360
to store that in our database.

111
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.570
Right.

112
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.930
Okay.

113
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.580
So to do that, all we just have to do is to create a web record credential created, then share.

114
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.530
Okay.

115
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.030
Then it's going to be equal to go.

116
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.610
Go.

117
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.970
Go go provider.

118
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.030
You can get rid of this and dos Cavendish.

119
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.660
Okay.

120
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.550
As well.

121
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.810
We need to say this.

122
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.050
This if I know and where I think we need to hide this.

123
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.410
Okay.

124
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.800
So via this Google provider, this condition has a property known as assess token.

125
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.040
Okay.

126
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.600
And this is going to be the Google Heights thoughts.

127
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.800
As is typical.

128
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.830
Over a year.

129
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.150
We can then.

130
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:06.100
Had this, you not check and it also has the I.D. Tucker and this is gonna be Google or its thoughts

131
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.570
Heidi took her.

132
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.920
And you had this and had your semi-colon.

133
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.030
So comma.

134
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.560
Okay, you can see over here we signed in the user rights and we also signed the results in the rainbow

135
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.860
cards.

136
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.490
We'll go use it.

137
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.030
Then over here you can see we are calling the Google user, right, because this Google user just signed

138
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.810
in the user.

139
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.700
So it's associated with our user.

140
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.930
And over here we are checking the user is either logged in or not.

141
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.770
Right.

142
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.890
Okay.

143
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.390
So we are more like transferring this report to this Google, right?

144
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.720
Right.

145
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.020
Okay.

146
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.370
And over here, the Google Heart also has access to the parents user rights.

147
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.730
Okay.

148
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.760
So over here, we are simply having access to the user details.

149
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.750
Okay.

150
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.960
By saying when they shot this robot we created and Google had provider, the condition and access token

151
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.230
is equal to the this Google heart that US's second and Google heart that I took.

152
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.160
Okay great.

153
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:19.670
Now the final step is to store the user in this quantification tab that is this users tab.

154
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.860
Okay, not to do this, we are going to call that what we just talked about.

155
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.980
This number is installed the fabulous.

156
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.020
All right, so I'm going to use this rainbow.

157
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.760
Okay.

158
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.080
Where it initializing it?

159
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.620
Over here.

160
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.990
As you can see.

161
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.540
And.

162
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.440
Great not to do this.

163
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:47.180
All what you just have to do is say user is a credential.

164
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.940
It's a three day show.

165
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.140
Okay.

166
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.400
We can just go ahead and see.

167
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.700
This is a type of user acquisition and user recommendation.

168
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.810
Okay.

169
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.770
Most times you don't really have to specify the type, but most times it is needed.

170
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.740
You can see over here we did not specify the type.

171
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.070
Okay.

172
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:12.000
And so what we just have to say is to, first of all, says didn't wait.

173
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:22.110
And now we can't say a weight then that we're able to code on the scorecards and darts sign in.

174
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.370
Sign in with credentials.

175
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.750
You can see it automatically pass the arts credential this rebel right.

176
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.630
Because everyone has access towards the property.

177
00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.020
Okay.

178
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.460
Hopefully you understand this, but if you don't is absolutely fine.

179
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.690
I believe as the process goes, you've got to understand everything.

180
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.130
Okay.

181
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.700
So this is basically all we need to do to save the user.

182
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.550
So this is us type, okay?
