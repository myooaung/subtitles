1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.340
The guys work in this lecture.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.350
They're going to display the card item.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.400
So it's a prize.

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay.

5
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.490
Then it has to do this.

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.970
We're going to need to go back to our visa code and then the provider directory and then the card provider

7
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.490
PHI.

8
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.910
Okay.

9
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.420
And now we can then use control and beat in order to make this right.

10
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.780
Okay.

11
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.240
Now we're going to create a function for this.

12
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.390
We can just create this function over here so we have access to the.

13
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.840
Hot.

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.330
Okay, now via.

15
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.650
We can give some space.

16
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.590
Okay.

17
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.910
This is going to be data type of double and we can see it gets.

18
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.560
We're going to call this total.

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.200
So to.

20
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.150
Can you just call this sort?

21
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.770
Amounts.

22
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.530
Okay.

23
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.140
Grids.

24
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.670
Now, first of all.

25
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.800
Look, I think we're.

26
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.590
We already done it.

27
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.570
Okay?

28
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.690
There's a lot of rights.

29
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.640
We have already calculate the total rights.

30
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.480
What?

31
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.590
We are simply doing this.

32
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.920
We created a function called still timeout.

33
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.880
And first of all, we are saying today is equal to zero.

34
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.290
Right.

35
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.020
That's means we don't have any products.

36
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.520
Right.

37
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.880
Okay.

38
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.990
The way we are looking over each item that is over, each product that is this Gucci oversize and this

39
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.150
t shirt, t shirt of our size.

40
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.450
Right.

41
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.500
So we can simply just get rid of this since we already have it.

42
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.860
Okay.

43
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.320
Now we can just use consciousness to see.

44
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.770
Okay.

45
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.990
Now, in order to have access to this.

46
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.450
So timeouts are going to first need to have access to the costs provider.

47
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.320
Class.

48
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.600
Right.

49
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.930
So I'm gonna go back to where we have this.

50
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.370
Okay.

51
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.540
That's going to be the.

52
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.070
Carts Item writes.

53
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.990
I think I tell him, and now we can then use control.

54
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.150
And that's when we decide, okay.

55
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.580
I think we are both in the.

56
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.590
Okay.

57
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.280
Sorry.

58
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.540
There's going to be the cots.

59
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.080
Korean.

60
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.400
That's all we have.

61
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.300
That bottom --.

62
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.830
Okay.

63
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.380
Cuts.

64
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.960
Cut screen.

65
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.390
Okay.

66
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.200
There's the wire.

67
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.910
Okay.

68
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.020
We can then use control and be.

69
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.450
Okay.

70
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.680
I think we other.

71
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.170
Yeah.

72
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.190
Okay.

73
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.120
And.

74
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.410
This is it, right?

75
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.340
So we can get rid of this and use this this in order to assess the variable so they can see it on the

76
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.410
scorecards provider.

77
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.040
Right.

78
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.360
Then there's going to be darts.

79
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.390
Two timeouts.

80
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.810
Okay.

81
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.700
Now use control and s to save.

82
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.160
But you can see now what we can do is we can.

83
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.180
Get rid of this long number, we can say that's still.

84
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.600
String first we can then pass into that as we want to.

85
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.990
None of us.

86
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.410
Only.

87
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.640
Look, you can see if there is and then watch is going to be Syria but now we currently have two you

88
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.060
can see.

89
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.160
Okay, great.

90
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.300
What we can then do is we can add the dollar sign and at least a dollar sign.

91
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.380
We're going to give his back.

92
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.270
Slash and then dollar.

93
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.710
Okay.

94
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.140
Great.

95
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.010
As do I think we need for the subject to write.

96
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.790
It should be at.

97
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.930
It should be the first.

98
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.620
So what we can do and do is we can go to.

99
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.140
Go to.

100
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.650
Okay.

101
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.460
I think we have it via.

102
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.180
Okay.

103
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.580
So.

104
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.800
Okay.

105
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.660
I think we have that within the cards, Ethan.

106
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.420
Okay.

107
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.740
I am sorry.

108
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.920
Which category at the end?

109
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.540
With the card.

110
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.850
Card item.

111
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.600
Okay.

112
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.650
There's a conveyor.

113
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.350
We can.

114
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.320
So to tell.

115
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.810
Okay.

116
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.340
So.

117
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.640
So.

118
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.220
Okay.

119
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.750
I think we had it all.

120
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.140
But for some reasons, I don't have it.

121
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.520
Okay.

122
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.830
It is going to be.

123
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.490
Probably mystically delighted or if you don't have it in your you can know how this is going to be cut.

124
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.700
So.

125
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.380
Okay, cuts triggered dirt.

126
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.740
So I think where they have it is where we saw total.

127
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.260
Okay.

128
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.200
There's a substantive difference.

129
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.030
I don't know.

130
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.750
Four of them mystically delighted.

131
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.540
You can see the case control, Steve.

132
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.760
Okay.

133
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.330
Now we can then have the dollar sign.

134
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.750
Okay.

135
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.510
You can add it all.

136
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.190
There is the backslash.

137
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.730
And then.

138
00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.460
Okay.

139
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.000
Okay.

140
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.200
Now this art.

141
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.840
Okay, you can see you can see everything is going.

142
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.240
Okay.

143
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.140
We can as well.

144
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.970
Well.

145
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.240
And.

146
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.460
The again.

147
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.560
Okay.

148
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.960
Okay, great.

149
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.340
Now, if for any reason you are confused, please do well to let me know.

150
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.300
So I'm going to try my best in order to explain very much for you.

151
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.170
If you have an issue with the code, probably your code is not running as mine.

152
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.820
You can let me know.

153
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.210
Or if you are finding issues with Alicia, probably you amidu is taking, uploading and make sure you

154
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.060
can as well to let me know when to change it immediately.

155
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.480
Okay.

156
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.480
So I think this is basically all for the cards.

157
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.820
Okay.

158
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.450
Right.

159
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.620
Okay.
