00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.350
A guy's walk home in this lecture, we're going to have to divide and test and we are going to have

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.500
them displayed horizontally, that is from left to right.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.010
Okay.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
So in order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our via code.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.030
And you can see via this last container we have is for this over here.

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.370
So we send the column.

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.150
Sorry.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.210
After this container within the column.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.560
Yes, we can just have the channel come out via its control and save.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560
And over here we can then have.

11
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.910
A trailer my there and the first widgets we're going to use is a size box which is similar to that of

12
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.330
the container and we can then have a height of 40.

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.600
Now, like I said, we are going to have three widgets that is to divider and the test is going to be

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.470
at the middle.

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.030
And these three tests are going to be this theory.

16
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.450
Widgets are going to be displayed horizontally, that is from left to right.

17
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.060
So what we have to do is this task box has a property known as child.

18
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.330
And for the child it's going to be a row widget.

19
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.030
And the reason for this row is because we want to be able to display widgets horizontally.

20
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.170
And as we know, the row can take multiple widgets.

21
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:34.030
So it asks this to draw property and the first child is going to be something known as divider.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.580
Diverter.

23
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.480
Or we can just give a size box to this as well.

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.620
That is how long or how wide we want this divider to be so we can give a sized.

25
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.610
Size box.

26
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.490
Then we can say hides.

27
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.920
We want the hides to be 40.

28
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.240
Long and the wheat to be 50 wide.

29
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.770
Okay.

30
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.190
I don't recover and use control and as to save now.

31
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.830
Okay.

32
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.440
And now we can have the child.

33
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.800
The child is going to be something known as divider.

34
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.780
Divider.

35
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.370
The Varda The Divider has a property which is known as colour.

36
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.750
For the colours we can see colours dirt's grey.

37
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.370
And also the Divider has a property known as thickness.

38
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.920
That is the thickness of what we want.

39
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.360
We can then say one and how do trachoma use confer?

40
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.390
And that's to save this and check it out.

41
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.470
You're going to see it over.

42
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.890
Hopefully you can see it or maybe you can't.

43
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.320
Okay.

44
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.210
And.

45
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.160
We can just have it come over.

46
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.440
There is control and save.

47
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.030
And had your trainer coma.

48
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.950
We can then have.

49
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.230
It says widgets, which is going to say account.

50
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.180
In full and for.

51
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.540
And we can add the chain of command and all this type of property to this sty test.

52
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:27.610
Test sty, we can increase the font size to maybe 22 and we can increase the font suite.

53
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:36.880
We can then save font suite's font with W 700, that is, we don't want it to be that bold and we can

54
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.350
change the color to colors the grades and make it look faded.

55
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.750
The key had you to look over.

56
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.080
And I think we're missing one additional parenthesis and additional comma and use control to save.

57
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.970
Okay.

58
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.420
You're going to say it over here.

59
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.890
Okay, great.

60
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.610
Now, how about you?

61
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.430
We can have another divider.

62
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.860
Okay, I'm just going to had a channel cover and size box.

63
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.940
Size works.

64
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.900
And heights is going to be 40.

65
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.600
That is how long and wheat.

66
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.870
He's going to be 50.

67
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.910
And then the child.

68
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.970
It is going to be a divider.

69
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.850
Divider.

70
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.210
And as in all, the divider has the color property, we could say colors that red.

71
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.300
So make it more visible, but we can just go with colors that gray and we can also specify the thickness

72
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.890
we could save five.

73
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.600
This will make it more thicker.

74
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.040
And I think we're missing one additional parenthesis.

75
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.490
Okay, go check it out.

76
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.810
You're going to see the difference between you can see this.

77
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.970
This looks way thicker than this, where we could just go with one as well to have equal thickness.

78
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.620
Okay.

79
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.580
And.

80
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.980
What we can then do is within the row we can then say main axis.

81
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.760
Sorry.

82
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.860
Main axis.

83
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.910
Alignment.

84
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.930
Main.

85
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.060
Main is.

86
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.630
I lament the center.

87
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.580
Use contour and se to save and.

88
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.270
Looking great, right?

89
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.290
Okay, now we can take this a bit to the bottom.

90
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.040
To do that, we have to go to the top.

91
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.740
That is, before this first bar we wrap, we are wrapping the row with this size box.

92
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.310
Probably you can get rid of this to see what happens.

93
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.990
Remove this widget and see if there is really any difference.

94
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.170
Okay.

95
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.370
Not really difference.

96
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.140
I think that's just a dead code.

97
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.070
Okay.

98
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.450
So you could have a size box.

99
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.260
Size works.

100
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.050
And.

101
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.110
We can then see heights.

102
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.610
We are given the space vertically, right?

103
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:14.700
So this is going to be height, maybe heights of 20 and then it's going to go to the bottom with 26.

104
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.570
I think this is looking.

105
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.740
This is looking great.

106
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.100
Or probably we can increase the size of the test to maybe 24.

107
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.000
And see.

108
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.040
Okay.

109
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.230
Look, this is basically all you need to know about divider.

110
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.670
You can see how it works now.

111
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.340
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
