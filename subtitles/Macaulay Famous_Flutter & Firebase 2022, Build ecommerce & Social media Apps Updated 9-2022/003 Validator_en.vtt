00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.580
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.120
In this lecture, we are going to have the validation check to our seller's registration form.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.780
Okay.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.910
Now, in order to do this, we have to head back to our VTS code and then the London seller screen and

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.270
what we can do, we can use control and B to make this wide.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.990
Okay, not to do this the test form field.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.280
Has a property known as validator.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:40.370
So you can see this is the first test form field for the foo name and it has a property known as validator.

10
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.510
Validator and we need a parenthesis over here because it is a callback and within the parentheses it

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.960
needs something known as value value.

12
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.480
And the value is basically referring to whatsoever we're going to type in here.

13
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.860
So f f f so the value is basically referring to this f, f, f if it is a DTD, the value is basically

14
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.660
referring to this dtd.

15
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.070
And over here we need this.

16
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.040
And now we are going to have some check.

17
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780
So via we can create an IFF statement and we can say if value.

18
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.130
If Value Dots is empty.

19
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.430
Okay.

20
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.980
We need a no check over here.

21
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.940
If it is.

22
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.730
If it is empty, then.

23
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.360
We are going to return a test.

24
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.990
Which is going to say please full name.

25
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.110
Full name must not be empty.

26
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.230
Okay.

27
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.050
Else.

28
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.610
We can then retard.

29
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.700
No, that is.

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.640
We do not want to do anything at the moment.

31
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.500
Okay.

32
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.620
Okay.

33
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.250
Great.

34
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.950
Or via the telephone field as the property known as validator.

35
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.230
And you can see we have this parenthesis over here and we pass in the value.

36
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.720
And the value is basically referring to whatsoever the user is going to type in here.

37
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.190
So this is f f, so the value is referring to this F, F, F, and over here we created an F statement

38
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.260
and we are saying if the value is not empty, then only we want to return a test which says Please full

39
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.850
name must not be empty else if it is filled in, we don't we don't want to do anything right.

40
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.110
Okay.

41
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.860
That means we want to go ahead.

42
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.780
Okay.

43
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.500
Now, to make this validator work, we have to create something known as form key to do that over here.

44
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.640
We are going to create a variable and we can just go ahead and specify the type of variable it is a

45
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.310
type of something known as global.

46
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.020
Luba Cheh.

47
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.190
And we can then say from states.

48
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.760
Okay.

49
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.210
And now we can call this variable underscore form key.

50
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.190
And it's going to be equal to.

51
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.700
Sorry, Glauber.

52
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.410
Over key.

53
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.940
Wilbur.

54
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.700
Globe, Iraqi and Dubai.

55
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.950
It is from state.

56
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.490
Okay.

57
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.450
Great.

58
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.010
And now we need to bind this form key to form.

59
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.970
To do that, what we have to do is over this column.

60
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.340
We are going to wrap it.

61
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.940
That is the parent column.

62
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.700
We are going to wrap it with a widget known as form.

63
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.580
So over here we can alight and use control and dot wrap with widgets.

64
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.940
And we're going to wrap this with a widget known as form.

65
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.350
And now this form has a property known as key and we can then call the underscore key.

66
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.260
Remember, we are also on this call form key.

67
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.610
Remember, we are basically making this we made it on this call because we want this variable not to

68
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.510
be assessable outside this London seller screen.

69
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.140
So what we can do, we can use control and s and.

70
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.290
We're going to need to scroll down to where we have this button.

71
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.830
Right.

72
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.330
The sign up button.

73
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.790
And.

74
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.630
Okay.

75
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.360
Okay.

76
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.640
This is it over here.

77
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.310
The sign up and we have to look for.

78
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.940
The button.

79
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.010
Okay.

80
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.750
This is it over here.

81
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.910
You can see the sign up and this is the gesture detector.

82
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.790
And over here, we need an E statement.

83
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.930
You statement again.

84
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.470
And we're going to say on the score from Key Dodd's current state, we are checking the current state

85
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.020
or the current situation of the form.

86
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.740
The current state dot is valid date.

87
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.070
That is if the fields are not empty.

88
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.390
We need a no check over there.

89
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.960
Then we want to print something to ourselves for now.

90
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.770
Which is going to say.

91
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.240
Could.

92
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.500
Good house if it is empty, that is.

93
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.820
If it is not validated.

94
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.390
Right.

95
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.270
Then want to say please?

96
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.360
Okay.

97
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.840
We can just print these.

98
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.970
Fields.

99
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.650
Or you can just say, please do the right.

100
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.510
Ten.

101
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.730
Okay.

102
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.230
And we need a semicolon over here.

103
00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.480
And semicolon and use contrariness to say this is basically all we need to do to set validation for

104
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.950
that first field.

105
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.230
Okay.

106
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.050
Now let's try to click on this.

107
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.470
You can see, please full name must not be empty.

108
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.130
So all we just have to do now is to do it for the rest.

109
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.610
Like I'm going to do it one more time so you understand the process.

110
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.130
Then I'm going to copy the rest of the codes.

111
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.790
Okay.

112
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.790
This is for the full name and this is for the password, and so this is for the email.

113
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.180
And we can basically just use this field.

114
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.550
He's going to walk similar.

115
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.110
Right?

116
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.570
But the reason we are using this test form field is the test field does not have this property known

117
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.450
as known as known as validator.

118
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.280
You can see we do not have that validator property.

119
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.810
So over here, over the customer log screen.

120
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.990
Over the customer log in screen.

121
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.840
You can see we are not using anything like validates or where we are basically using that way to validate

122
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.800
our users.

123
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.700
Right.

124
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.220
So basically you can just get rid of this.

125
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.870
And use the test form field.

126
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.180
So still the same thing.

127
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.590
But we need access to the validator, right?

128
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.930
So that's why we have to use the test form field because there is nothing like that for the test field.

129
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.620
Okay.

130
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.170
Now we have access to the validator.

131
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.970
And over here, we need to pass the value and the values referred to whatsoever.

132
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.140
These are going to type into the text field and value.

133
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.410
Okay.

134
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.790
And now we can have an if statement, a value that is empty.

135
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.160
But you do.

136
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.240
It is empty.

137
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.960
Okay.

138
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.430
We need a check.

139
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.020
Can you use and be okay if it is empty?

140
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.080
Then we.

141
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.030
Want to return.

142
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.840
It says it's going to say place.

143
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.110
Email must not be empty.

144
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.540
OC and else.

145
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.890
We just want to go on with our life.

146
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:13.590
Okay.

147
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.310
This country needs to save.

148
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.250
And.

149
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.060
Now click on this.

150
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.440
Look, you can see the way up.

151
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.500
This email must not be empty.

152
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.630
Hopefully you've mastered this process.

153
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.850
We can just copy this now and.

154
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.990
Basted for the password.

155
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.309
Okay.

156
00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.320
And this is going to be password.

157
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.150
Okay.

158
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.590
Okay.

159
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.490
And use controller.

160
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:52.430
And say, please password must not be between this way and the previous way we did.

161
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:59.200
That is creating a controller controller class and you can see we have this validation.

162
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.860
You can choose which one is more convenient for you and you can use any of them.

163
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.990
It's basically going to work similar.

164
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:15.170
So I think maybe this one we are currently using is a bit more easier to setup validation or anyone

165
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:21.020
you think it's more convenient for you, you can just go with that there of ways to do the same thing,

166
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.590
to achieve the same results and flow to.

167
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.310
So any of the ways you think is very convenient for you, you can go with it.

168
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.070
What could guys say in the next lecture?
