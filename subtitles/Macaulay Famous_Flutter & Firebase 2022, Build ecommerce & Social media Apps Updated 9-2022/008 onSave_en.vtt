00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.910
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.940
In this lecture, we are going to change this on change callback to be the save callback.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.450
Now currently you might not be able to know the difference between the change callback and the unsaved

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.079
callback.

6
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:23.730
But in the future, when we create the search functionality, we are going to use this on change callback

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.480
and by that time you will know the difference between the change callback and the unsaved callback.

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.080
Okay.

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.670
So for now we have to get rid of this or change callback.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.800
And within the test form field it has the property known as unsaved.

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.040
And over here we need a no check.

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.350
Right.

13
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.230
And we also have to change this.

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.820
To.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.570
On Save.

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.360
And over here we have to use the no check.

17
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.630
And why you?

18
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.330
On Save.

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.660
And no check.

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.470
And over where?

21
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.840
Over here.

22
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.470
On Save.

23
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.770
And no check.

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.670
Okay.

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.580
And lastly, what we can also do.

26
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.350
We can make sure the form is saved before sending all these fields to the database.

27
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:39.410
To do that right before this, if images if our image result is empty, we can make sure the form is

28
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.740
saved.

29
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.990
That is, save the form first.

30
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.740
That is, save the form for us locally before submitting all of them, all the fields to the database.

31
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.770
To do that, we have to say underscore from key.

32
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.330
On this call from KY.

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.440
We also do have to get the current situation of the form by saying states and now we have to say dot

34
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.220
save or via.

35
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.970
Great.

36
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:16.860
So basically what we are doing is if all these fields are valid, we want to save the farm locally first.

37
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.940
Right.

38
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.800
And after we want to check if the user has picked images.

39
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.150
If yes, then we want to print just the price and the quantity.

40
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.680
And also we are using the state in order to set the images to know.

41
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.500
Right.

42
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.960
So you can see this empty list as low or just at least with that variable.

43
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.380
Right.

44
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.920
So we are results and it's the more you can see why we created this variable called images and we said

45
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.620
it's not.

46
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.040
And currently we are passing the value that is the images to this variable.

47
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.920
So it is no longer no at this moment.

48
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.990
Right.

49
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.370
And over here, we are setting it back.

50
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.170
We are setting it back to.

51
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.590
No.

52
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.220
Okay.

53
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.740
Hopefully you understand this.

54
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.260
And over here we are saying on the score from key the state that we set.

55
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.920
So basically we set all these fields.

56
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.150
All these fields we have.

57
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.510
Okay.

58
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.680
Now let's try this out.

59
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.250
Basically it's going to work same.

60
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.690
That is why I said in the future, when we create the search functionality, you will fully understand

61
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.850
the difference between the save and the change callback.

62
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.340
Okay.

63
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.350
But for now, you can just see as the same thing.

64
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.420
Okay for the price.

65
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.040
It's going to be under a dollar.

66
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.230
We didn't really need to pass the.

67
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.180
The DOT default is going to have the DOT zero for us.

68
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.380
Okay.

69
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.810
And five.

70
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.430
I'm just going to type something gibberish and something gibberish.

71
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.110
And I'm going to click on.

72
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.080
Applaud.

73
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.470
So upload.

74
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.750
Okay.

75
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.680
You can see now.

76
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.750
What's similar?

77
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.080
I think we did not save what is going to be the same thing.

78
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.770
And go check it out.

79
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.080
Okay.

80
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.360
Now we have this error.

81
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.660
I'm just going to do all three studies again.

82
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.290
Or to be certain.

83
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.870
And we have to try these apps to make sure we have no single harass.

84
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.760
Okay.

85
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.320
And now we have to try this.

86
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.890
First of all, I'm going to pick the product images.

87
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.470
So.

88
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.050
All right.

89
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.160
Pick this.

90
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.530
Pick this sari.

91
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.910
Pick this and pick this.

92
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.140
And select.

93
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.600
Okay.

94
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.160
It's there.

95
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.990
And for the price we can say ten and for the quantity we can say for and for the product name.

96
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.980
I'm just going to say something gibberish.

97
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.930
And for the product description, something gibberish and click on upload.

98
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.330
Okay.

99
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.300
And go check it out.

100
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.570
I think we are printing it out.

101
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.930
You can see the Viet Thanh and you can see it hard that the dots zero for us and you can see two.

102
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.980
Very good.

103
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.310
Okay.

104
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.110
Seems good.

105
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.270
Okay.

106
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.080
Okay, guys.
