00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.720
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.580
Now, in this lecture, we're going to view the bottom navigation bar.

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.230
So we are going to be able to navigate between pages within our hub.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.300
Now, currently we are logged in and we are currently at the home page.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.130
Now that's a quote from that strategy home page.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.690
What you can do is to go to the terminal, then you terminar, then you're going to see the debug console,

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.250
then click on it.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.910
Now you can see currently we are at the home screen.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.620
That is the home page, right?

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.070
Okay.

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.820
Now what we're going to do in this lecture is now going to create the bottom navigation bar.

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.380
And the reason for this is we want to be able to navigate to different pages within our hub.

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.770
Okay?

15
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.440
Now to do this, we're going to go to the home screen.

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.510
So first of all, I'm going to remove this, then I'm going to go to Fry's, then I'm going to go to

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.670
home screen.

18
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.330
Okay?

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.870
Now I want to use Control and V to make this wide.

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.800
Then first of all, I want to remove this set of widgets.

21
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
So this is going to highlight first, then use control and dots.

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.360
Sorry.

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.890
Control and.

24
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.940
Okay.

25
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.700
They're going to click on remove this widget.

26
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.040
Now if I use an and to.

27
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
You can see it's no longer the at the center.

28
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.770
Okay.

29
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.000
Now we also got to do now is sort of the view the bottom navigation bar.

30
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.570
Okay.

31
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.280
So to do this within the scaffold are going to say bottom navigation bar.

32
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.560
We can as say bottom.

33
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.590
Navigational bar.

34
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.350
But I'm going to be using the Covaxin or Saba, which is similar to the bottle shop, but as so as trust

35
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.890
ties.

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.460
So I'm going to see.

37
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.160
No.

38
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.760
Top story top.

39
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.250
But.

40
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.070
What's in the tub.

41
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.670
Okay.

42
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.320
Now as well are going to pass in the items.

43
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.800
Okay.

44
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.440
Now we have a five.

45
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.610
Buzz.

46
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.160
Okay.

47
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.190
So to do that over these items, that is you can see these items is a list, right?

48
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.530
So we're going to have five items.

49
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.660
So we're going to say bottom.

50
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.840
Bottom navigation bar tab.

51
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.420
For the icon, you're going to use the icon widget.

52
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.950
So this is going to be icons dot home.

53
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.730
Okay.

54
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.670
Now also, you're going to make this icon big.

55
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.810
So you're going to pass in the size of probably 30.

56
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.040
Okay.

57
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.410
Now we're going to have a little bit to it.

58
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.720
We can see this is the home.

59
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.330
Screen or the whole page.

60
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.780
Okay.

61
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.040
Now, I would had my credit karma.

62
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.930
Then I'm just going to copy this.

63
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.430
And.

64
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.030
Paste of two five terms, that is four more times.

65
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.700
So this is to see three, four and five.

66
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.210
Okay.

67
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.280
Now for the.

68
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.710
Second icon is going to be such.

69
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.700
So there's a switch screen.

70
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.290
Okay.

71
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.180
So there's going to be a switch.

72
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.880
Okay.

73
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.330
Now, in the future, we're going to customize this trade icon.

74
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.960
So for dinner, I'm just going to leave it with the whole icon.

75
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.750
So for the fourth icon, there's going to be icons dot.

76
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.740
Message.

77
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.420
Okay.

78
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.460
So over here, the labor says can be messages.

79
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.360
Okay.

80
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.520
Now for the future icon.

81
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.560
Icon dot.

82
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.300
Preston.

83
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.220
And we can see the.

84
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.910
Sorry.

85
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.610
You can see this is the profile.

86
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.380
Screen.

87
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.510
Okay, is what gets get rid of this, get shredded comma.

88
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.150
So this should be size.

89
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.180
Yes.

90
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.950
Okay, great.

91
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.240
Now, when I use control and s to save a okay, we should automatically give us a very good format.

92
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.170
Okay.

93
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.330
I'm just had my chair collider.

94
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.800
So.

95
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.550
Yeah.

96
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.260
As well.

97
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.840
Good.

98
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.970
Now.

99
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.930
Check it out.

100
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.010
Okay.

101
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.470
Now what you can do.

102
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.340
You can make this background black as well.

103
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.960
So to do that.

104
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.440
Over years.

105
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.690
I'm just gonna break this down, okay?

106
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.120
You can't say background color.

107
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.770
We can use our background color we have in the closet.

108
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.960
Okay.

109
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.880
Let me check it out.

110
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.620
Okay, great.

111
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.430
Now, you can see this selected item is.

112
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.130
That is the greatest color.

113
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.240
So what you can do, you can see the selected item or this artsy or should this something else.

114
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.100
So to do that.

115
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.800
Over here as well.

116
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.350
He's going to break this down.

117
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.060
You can see at sea of color.

118
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.730
Who wants to color to be close?

119
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.980
Thoughts, Red.

120
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.140
Okay.

121
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.700
But check it out.

122
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.670
Okay.

123
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.810
Now, this is the conference page.

124
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.430
We are.

125
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.990
We are currently in the home screen, so it speaks to the red collar.

126
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.070
So all these are the Nazis icons, right?

127
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.300
So as well.

128
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.090
We can see for the inactive hollow.

129
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.370
That is the page we are not in.

130
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.740
We want to call lots of colors towards white.

131
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.400
Okay.

132
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.930
Go check it out.

133
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.150
Okay.

134
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.780
Great.

135
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.490
Okay.

136
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.750
19 is nature.

137
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.000
They're going to make this all applicable.

138
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.050
But before then I'm going to do some YouTube bits, modification of others, log in screen.

139
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.710
Now we know what we are typing the password.

140
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.920
We don't want it to be visible to anyone.

141
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.630
So what you can do, which in the test should I think have something known as of secured or secured

142
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.080
says.

143
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.430
So you can set it to true.

144
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:06.200
So whenever we are typing the password, the what if nobody is going to see it's also going to go to

145
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.250
the side of.

146
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.480
I think we also have the password there looking for the password as well.

147
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.390
I want to see how secure says to true.

148
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.690
So we want the password to be invisible.

149
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.250
Okay, great.

150
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.680
So then in this lecture, I want to make this clickable.

151
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.770
So they're going to be able to navigate to pages.

152
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.220
Okay.

153
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.980
Okay, guys, see you in in this lecture.
