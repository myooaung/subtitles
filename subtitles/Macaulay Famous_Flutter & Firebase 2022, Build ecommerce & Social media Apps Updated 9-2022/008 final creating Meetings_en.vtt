00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.560
WALKER In the last lecture, we created this class called GSC Controller, and we sent a class.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.860
We created a function called Create Mutant.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.100
Then within the parentheses of the function we passed in this theory, dynamic variables.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.990
That is the room name.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.700
This audio muted.

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.530
Others video muted.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
And one of the reasons for this is because we want our values to be dynamic.

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.530
That is, for example, you can see over here we have this room which is referring to the room name.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.460
We can easily just say the room name should be called.

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.780
My room.

12
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.290
But the problem is, it is not going to be unique.

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.840
That is, every user is going to have a room.

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.250
They called my room and we agreed to this that we don't want this.

15
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.490
Instead, we want our room name to be unique.

16
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.630
Okay, so that was why we have to pass in this dynamic data card room.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.960
Name.

18
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.560
Okay.

19
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.600
So now in this lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to use this function called create method.

20
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.080
Okay.

21
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.700
That's a use this function.

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.670
We're going to need to use control and data like this, Lola.

23
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.840
Then.

24
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.450
Is going to use control s to save this first.

25
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.150
Then they're going to go to our screens, then the meat on the screen.

26
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.270
Then we're going to lose control and we to make this white.

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.400
Okay, that over here.

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.470
They're going to create a function.

29
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.910
Harriet.

30
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.790
We're just going to call this function create.

31
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.060
Medicine or create new medicine.

32
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.840
Okay.

33
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.460
Great.

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.860
Now we are going to use that function card.

35
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.520
Create medicine.

36
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.350
Now, as we know, we have access to this function.

37
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.660
We thought of it as this to the class called GSC Controller.

38
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.110
Okay, first of access to this, how to do that, we can simply just create a V able to store that class.

39
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.500
Okay.

40
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.580
So over here we're going to create a a variable.

41
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.980
And I'm going to call this variable or this core, Jesse.

42
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.890
Controller.

43
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.160
Then he's going to raise in the oldest court because we don't want to I says this verbal aside, this

44
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.520
fight.

45
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.590
Okay so it's going to be equal to the class called get see.

46
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.790
Jet ski controller.

47
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.360
Okay.

48
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.980
Now we can specify the type.

49
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.480
It is a type of.

50
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.430
Jet ski controller.

51
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.340
Okay, now we have access.

52
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.390
We can have access to that.

53
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.560
Create medicine.

54
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.840
Okay, now over here, all we just have to see is all this cool jet ski.

55
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.740
Controller standards create Mitten Lake as is asking for the room name and as well is asking for the

56
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.200
is old you muted right so what is audio muted.

57
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:21.800
Defaults is going to be sets to true that's this once audio as well what is video muted defaults is

58
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.260
as well good to is set to true.

59
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.440
Okay.

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.530
Now we're going to make sure we had our semicolon over there.

61
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.790
Okay.

62
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.110
Now for the room name.

63
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.730
As we all agreed, we don't automatically generate a room name for the user is going to be a no value,

64
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.970
but you are going to convert that number to a string since we specify that it is a type of.

65
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.860
Starting over.

66
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.720
Okay, great.

67
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.130
So we're going to go back to the letter.

68
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.710
Let's go screen so the words, we can't do this.

69
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.680
We can create a variable called random.

70
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.510
Random Day.

71
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.040
We're going to set it to the court to do random.

72
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.110
Library.

73
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.650
Okay, great.

74
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.580
If for any reason it's not available, Ted.

75
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.720
You can use a light that is controlled.

76
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.070
Dot.

77
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.180
Okay.

78
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.220
Great.

79
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.260
Adios.

80
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.860
A record.

81
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.820
Now what I'm going to do, this is going to create a rainbow card room name, right?

82
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.170
This.

83
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.020
Real name.

84
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.150
As we said, we are going to convert it to a test so we can specify it is a type of string that is going

85
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.200
to be equal to.

86
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.710
This.

87
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.180
It's going to be a quarter of this random variable, random variable.

88
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.720
We can just wrap this with a parentheses are the parentheses.

89
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.170
Okay.

90
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.710
So now we're automatically going to generate a number, a number as the room.

91
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.430
Okay.

92
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.010
So this is going to be dots next.

93
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.320
It's okay.

94
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.490
We're going to have one.

95
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.530
Then we're going to have several zeros.

96
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.020
One, two, two, four, five, six, seven.

97
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.010
Okay.

98
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.720
Then we can say plus, then one as well is going to be one, two, two, four, five, six, seven.

99
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.690
Then the next thing we are going to need to do is to convert this to a test, since we have specified

100
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.270
that it is a test of using the string.

101
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.320
Okay.

102
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.340
So although you are going to need to see dots to.

103
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.240
String.

104
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.300
Okay.

105
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.440
I'll just say the colon.

106
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.940
Okay.

107
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.070
Now we're going to make use of this creates new information.

108
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.780
Okay.

109
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.250
So now is it oh, this.

110
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.160
They're going to get rid of all this.

111
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.000
Get rid of this, then they're going to use the creates.

112
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.060
New medicine.

113
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.740
Okay.

114
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.810
Now make sure you get rid of this because this and this is a different thing.

115
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.650
Okay.

116
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.200
Get rid of this audio record.

117
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.720
Then we're just going to we start this.

118
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.030
All three states now using the API 30.

119
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.570
Probably just inmates.

120
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.620
There's no supports.

121
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.540
Might not support.

122
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.210
Or you can just try it at first.

123
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.080
Okay.

124
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.840
Okay.

125
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.440
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to click on this now.

126
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.260
Okay.

127
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.010
Can see.

128
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.230
Okay.

129
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.660
Well, that's great.

130
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.380
So I can see it generated a random number for us as the real name.

131
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.160
And you can see now this is the room name, right?

132
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.870
We said we want it to be unique so we have to use the random.

133
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.960
Okay, that over here you can see we can invite.

134
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.570
We can.

135
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.500
Okay.

136
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.580
It's going to pop out.

137
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:54.630
Okay, great.

138
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.740
You can see we can divide.

139
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.140
We can also.

140
00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.460
You can see.

141
00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.970
We can.

142
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.860
Okay.

143
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.610
Allow.

144
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.230
Okay.

145
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.570
Okay, great.

146
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.660
I'm going to start this then audio as well.

147
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.950
Great.

148
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.300
Over here.

149
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.820
You can see we can as well chat.

150
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.190
Right.

151
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.580
Okay.

152
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.190
You can see how far forward you just see the packages.

153
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.780
Well, I think you can see all this list of this.

154
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.160
So let's sound.

155
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.670
You can select sound to call from speaker.

156
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:41.850
We can as well raise and well, it's currently there's no other user, right.

157
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.490
So nobody's going see the hard rights.

158
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.910
Okay.

159
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:53.930
So we can do basically everything that you can't do with the way you can go to the of shows you can

160
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.550
see stuff screen sharing.

161
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.340
Right.

162
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.990
Okay.

163
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.880
Okay.

164
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.600
You can see.

165
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.170
Looks good, right?

166
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:05.880
Okay.

167
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.230
You can do basically everything you can do with Zoom.

168
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.020
Now, if for any reason you get it, you can car.

169
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.350
There's almost everybody.

170
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.030
It's everybody.

171
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.590
With everyone except yourself, if for any reason you are.

172
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.090
Having an issue, you can do well to let me know.

173
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.240
So I get that.

174
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.540
So for you as well.

175
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.960
Okay.

176
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.450
Okay.

177
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.960
Great.

178
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.350
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
