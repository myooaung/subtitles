00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.430
In this lecture, what we are going to do is we're going to have a WhatsApp icon over here so that users

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.640
can contact the seller of that product.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.450
Not to do this, we are going to be in the package.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.500
So head up to your browser and then pop the dev.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.700
And over here we are going to search for a package known as font or some flutter.

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.520
Okay.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And we have to click on this first link and now we have to copy this code.

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:49.790
And head back to our vice squad and post back the YAML file and you have to hide it in us.

11
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.290
You can see I already have that.

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.620
And now back to the.

13
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.970
The minor screen dietary and then the visit store screen.

14
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.640
And what we can do is we can use control and be to make this wide first.

15
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.320
Okay.

16
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.300
And now, now, now.

17
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.390
How did trying to come over by?

18
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.660
To format this.

19
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.780
And now it's in the scaffold.

20
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.860
It has a property we should send before it is known as Floating Action Button.

21
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.960
And this is going to be as well in action.

22
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.470
But then it is a button and it has this own press as its property.

23
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.450
And the nest property it has is a child which is going to be an icon with that.

24
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.710
And now we're going to use that font awesome package we just installed.

25
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.760
Fonts or some icons.

26
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.870
Then dot up OC.

27
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.850
Cisco.

28
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.260
I did turn the camera and use constraints to save in order to format.

29
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.479
I think we are missing one.

30
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.610
Okay.

31
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.550
Lots to.

32
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.800
This country needs to save.

33
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.060
And you should say it over here.

34
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.510
Okay.

35
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.190
Okay.

36
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.480
Sims.

37
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.880
Cool.

38
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.680
And also because the floating action button has a property known as background colour.

39
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.770
We can maybe say background colours that.

40
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.650
That's green to see it's going to look like.

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.190
Okay.

42
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.660
It's going to have that WhatsApp look.

43
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.950
Okay.

44
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.260
Sims.

45
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.810
Cool.

46
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.690
And for this main icon.

47
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.650
We can give a color to this if it's going to be called as a sign and see how this is going to look.

48
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.180
Okay.

49
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.840
Okay.

50
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.910
Hmm.

51
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.250
Not really visible.

52
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.390
Okay.

53
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.400
We could just use sign for this.

54
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.570
And.

55
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.000
Whites for this.

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.330
Basically once all the colors too much.

57
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.880
Okay.

58
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
To match, Sims could write.

59
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.620
I don't really know if it's cool this way.

60
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700
Or maybe you could just use your own style for this.

61
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.770
Okay.

62
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.590
Sounds good.

63
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.460
And.

64
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.080
Working as expected.

65
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.020
Okay.

66
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.290
Okay.

67
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.100
Okay, guys.
