00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.110
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.080
In this lecture, we are going to be able to navigate to the seller on screen.

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.950
Okay.

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.800
Now, hopefully these views are actually we are going to create a new screen and we're going to call

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.550
this seller on the score home on the score screen and the darts.

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.150
Okay.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.210
And now the seller's home screen is going to be similar to that of the customer home screen.

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.330
So what we can do is we can copy most of the codes.

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.759
In this customer homescreen.

11
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.920
We can highlight and use controller and see to copy and the cell on screen.

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.370
We can then place this array and we have to rename this and to easily do that we have to align it and

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.880
use control.

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.440
And the controller.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.310
And controller and controller and and seller.

16
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.990
On screen.

17
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.250
Okay.

18
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.680
You can see we have this route name called Silver Screen and we have to define that in the and the main,

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.840
the DOT five is contained B and this is going to be silver.

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.470
Silver screen Dot Root's name.

21
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.570
And we have to pass in the context and this and it's going to sell our.

22
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.550
Homescreen.

23
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.500
Okay.

24
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.890
What?

25
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.900
We start this.

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.370
Or we start.

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.580
Okay.

28
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.170
So we have to continue.

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.560
And back to the seller login screen.

30
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.830
We have that in the directory and over the seller login screen.

31
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.840
If the account has been successfully logged in.

32
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.600
Right.

33
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.280
Instead of Prince and Sela, we can use the navigator.

34
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.490
Navigates her.

35
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.140
But.

36
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.230
That's push replacement.

37
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.860
Sorry.

38
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.280
Push.

39
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.960
Name replacement.

40
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.110
Right.

41
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.479
I think we have that.

42
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.290
Push name.

43
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.530
Okay.

44
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.770
So I push replacement name what this wager is.

45
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.460
It will take us to the home screen and we want to be able to go back because definitely we don't want

46
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.960
to be able to go back from the home screen and back to the log in screen.

47
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.360
I think that is a bad design.

48
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.810
So over here we have to say the home screen.

49
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.960
Dot's routes name OC.

50
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.900
Great.

51
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.430
And this is basically it.

52
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.560
And the only differences we need in the phone screen is this.

53
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.290
Okay, back to the cell screen.

54
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.720
Down screen.

55
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.390
And.

56
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.200
We do not need this cut and profi.

57
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.100
So this is going to be maybe upload.

58
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.700
Upload.

59
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.860
All this could just be dashboard.

60
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.250
Dashboard can come first.

61
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.510
Dashboard.

62
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.370
And this is going to be icons.

63
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.520
Icons DOT Dashboard.

64
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.040
Dashboard.

65
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.530
And for this this is going to be icons that upload.

66
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.990
And of course, on the third and this is going to say upload.

67
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.970
Case trying to save.

68
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.410
Okay.

69
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.950
Okay.

70
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.370
Okay.

71
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.080
Okay.

72
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.990
And let's go try this out.

73
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.470
Back to the look.

74
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.520
And this.

75
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.990
And for the email address is going to be.

76
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.960
Test.

77
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.630
To store.

78
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.640
And the g-a-y and.

79
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.590
And click on log in.

80
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.980
Okay.

81
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.720
Sounds good.

82
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.519
We still do have that higher, right?

83
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.450
So what we can do.

84
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.339
I think we did that in the.

85
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.310
And customer.

86
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.680
Okay.

87
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.710
The seller.

88
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.710
That should be in the customer.

89
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.240
Customer.

90
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.930
Log in.

91
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.910
And this.

92
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.650
So we're going to replace it with that.

93
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.030
Return and back to the seller.

94
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.760
Log in.

95
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.460
And we can't get rid of this and use this OC Dot's push name and remove units.

96
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.380
So this is going to be what seller.

97
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.690
Seller.

98
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.050
On screen.

99
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.590
Okay.

100
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.910
Is contract necessary?

101
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.160
Remember, the reason for this error is because we have an Indian ROV.

102
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.270
Click on this.

103
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.380
You can see we are able to go back, which I think it is a bad design.

104
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.590
What we start again and this is definitely going to work.

105
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.430
Okay.

106
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.900
Okay.

107
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.900
Okay.

108
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.990
Okay.

109
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.290
And this.

110
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.950
My test.

111
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.250
Use this test or to OC and DJI may see and click on login.

112
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.330
Okay.

113
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.890
We just have to wait for this.

114
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.300
Okay.

115
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.130
You can see we are not able to log in back.

116
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.340
We still do have this seller on the screen.

117
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.280
I thought we changed the menu.

118
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.210
Already.

119
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.430
Okay.

120
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.250
I'm going to say it.

121
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.680
Okay.

122
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.760
Back to the seller.

123
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.140
We changed the menu.

124
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.350
Okay.

125
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.410
Wait for this and see.

126
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.710
Okay.

127
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.180
I think we logged into a wrong account.

128
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.040
I'm going to restart this.

129
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.830
We logged into the seller.

130
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.830
We logged into the customer account and not the seller.

131
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.140
That is why he's saying does not exist.

132
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.890
Right.

133
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.210
So we have to log into using the seller as a sales form field.

134
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.910
Okay.

135
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.820
Wait for this.

136
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.210
Okay.

137
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.000
And.

138
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.250
Twitter allows accounts.

139
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.440
And Logan.

140
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.920
And.

141
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.350
Test two saw.

142
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.960
And the password is NBC.

143
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.010
Okay.

144
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.700
Wait for this.

145
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.310
Okay.

146
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.890
Seems good.

147
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.830
You can see now we have this dashboard and upload.

148
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.600
And we have to also change this.

149
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.600
Okay.

150
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.970
Back to where we have that over there.

151
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.000
For now, we can just have a center to center the child.

152
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.710
Which is going to be a test and.

153
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.210
We can then say dashboard.

154
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.490
Dashboard.

155
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.580
And.

156
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.330
Center.

157
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.220
Child.

158
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.100
Test.

159
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.810
This is going to be what upload.

160
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.040
Okay.

161
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.260
This is contrary and excessive.

162
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.270
Okay.

163
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.770
Look, we just have to start this.

164
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.900
We have to start this and try again.

165
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.960
But make sure you log in through the test field for the seller.

166
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:29.090
Or maybe you can use other way to make it more easier for users to understand between sellers and customer.
