Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.490
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.300
Now, whenever a user tries to type into this test fields, we're going to have this overflow error.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.340
So in this lecture, we're going to sort this out.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.300
But before then, we as well need to rename this email to password and this is going to be enter your

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.110
password.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.950
Okay.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.290
So over the last test field, we are going to change this to.

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.250
Password.

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.460
Password.

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.900
And there's going to be enter your password and we can reduce this to solitaire.

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.710
He could save.

13
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.280
Now what we want to do is we're going to need to get rid of this overflow area that to do this, we're

14
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.950
going to wrap our color widget with a widget known as single child scroll view.

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.210
So by doing this, it's going to make this page scrollable.

16
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.350
So I'm just going to get rid of this first.

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.910
Okay.

18
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.290
Now, over this column, we're going to need to use country dots and wrap with widgets.

19
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.720
Then we're going to wrap it with a widget.

20
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.830
Load a single child, then scroll.

21
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.600
Single child scroll view OC is controlled to save.

22
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.360
I think it's going to be at the top of that.

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.920
What we can do is we can force it to the middle.

24
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.640
So we tell this sorry over this single task view, we are going to need to highlight and use current

25
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.000
trends and we're going to wrap it with a center with that.

26
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.100
Okay.

27
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.160
Then it's going to go back to it.

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.740
Okay.

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.130
So now you can see this page is now scrollable.

30
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.910
So it made me a user click on any of the fields.

31
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.250
It's going to take it to the top.

32
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.930
So by wrapping this with a single channel, scroll view is going to make this page scroll level or like

33
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.850
before or like before it was just stuck that at one spot.

34
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.190
Okay, great.

35
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.250
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
