00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.540
Hi.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.130
Now, what we can as well do is we can have a button over here so that when a user clicks on it, it

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.680
can then take the user back to the screen.

5
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.610
Okay, that to do this, we're gonna need to go back to our visit code.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.860
Now first of all we're going to get rid of this made us amendment center.

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.760
And the reason for this is we're going to have another widget.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.710
And this might cause an overflow error.

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.100
Right.

10
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.490
Okay.

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.630
And now are going to need to use control and this to safe.

12
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.360
You can see this is going to go back to the top.

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.620
Okay.

14
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.650
Now we can either use a widget for this button or we can create the button from scratch.

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.010
Okay.

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.900
So over here, we're going to need to add a comma and we can have a container.

17
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.270
Okay.

18
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.160
Now, first of all, we're gonna give this boat any height and a weight.

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.020
The weight us to do, it's our weight, but it's going to be the height as to do it.

20
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.790
How long is going to be.

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.190
Now, since we're going to be using a widget that's half a button, we do not actually need that heights.

22
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.600
The height is going to come from the widget whatsoever, going to be use it.

23
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.330
Okay, so we can just give a weight to the bottom.

24
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.660
That is our weight is going to be we can give a weight of 50.

25
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.780
Okay.

26
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.320
We can now decide the child is going to be a raised button.

27
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.410
Okay.

28
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.750
They can seize depreciated, but you can as well just use it or better see you can create boats from

29
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.260
scratch.

30
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.340
You're to know how to do that.

31
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.660
Right?

32
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.030
Okay.

33
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.680
For the oppressed.

34
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.870
Look at this.

35
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.890
And now we can arbitrary the cover, which is going to be a child.

36
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.350
But the child is going to be a test.

37
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.830
Which is.

38
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.910
We should look at the say chop shop now.

39
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.320
Okay.

40
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.590
I do try to cover and use control and assistive.

41
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.180
Okay.

42
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.130
You can see it over here.

43
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.380
Now, you can see the width of the button is way too small.

44
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.890
So what you're going to do is rebel against the weight of the screen.

45
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.280
To do that, you're going to need to get rid of this 50.

46
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.050
Then you're going to see media.

47
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.770
Query.

48
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480
Gets off contest, does size, does tweet.

49
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.300
So by doing this, we're going to get the weight of our screen.

50
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.100
They use control and that's to save.

51
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.490
Okay.

52
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.360
Because he's way too big.

53
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.260
He's way too wide.

54
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.560
Right.

55
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.700
So what we can do is we can say we want to -40.

56
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.700
From its.

57
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.500
Okay.

58
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.010
Great.

59
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.340
Now to this day, we're going to do it as we can.

60
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.550
This was bought in as a property, not as color.

61
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.220
You can see colors, just pink.

62
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.380
Other tinkerers.

63
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.910
Okay.

64
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.020
Now, we can also make this have around this ship, this raise button, as well as a property known

65
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.530
as ship.

66
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.720
Smith is going to be around that.

67
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.660
Rectangle border.

68
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.020
And we can give it whether we use.

69
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.170
There's going to be better videos this cycle or maybe 20.

70
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.700
Okay.

71
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.960
Go check it out.

72
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.440
Okay.

73
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.950
Great.

74
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.690
Now we can give.

75
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.560
Okay.

76
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.960
Now, what you're going to need to do is we can make this test center.

77
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.210
I think it's already set up.

78
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.500
Okay.

79
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.170
Just make sure it's at the center so we can wrap it with the center widget and we can give some side

80
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.740
to this.

81
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.000
Test, I.

82
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.390
First of all, they're just going to change the color.

83
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.550
Two colors, the white.

84
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.980
And that's all we can give it from tweets.

85
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.280
Often its.

86
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.700
That's Davis, isn't it?

87
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.500
We don't want it to be bullets that much.

88
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.860
Okay.

89
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.850
Now.

90
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.560
Go check it out.

91
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.350
Okay.

92
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.950
I think this is way too close to this so we can.

93
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.980
Then give your size books to this size works.

94
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.260
Though I give it the space vertically so there's going to be height.

95
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.100
Hides.

96
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.590
Of ten.

97
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.640
Oh, we can just go with 15 addition cover use culture necessary.

98
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.270
Okay.

99
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.450
Now we can take this a bit to the middle.

100
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.860
Okay.

101
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.640
Not to do that.

102
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.210
That gives a reason to margin.

103
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.940
I know that's our process of the margin.

104
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.060
Regular needs to be content.

105
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.690
Okay.

106
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.830
So what are going to do is we can add lights and use controlled dot then rough which contain that.

107
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.860
So by doing this, we now have access to the part in margin hides and all that.

108
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.270
So we can just have imagine there's going to be a hedge is sets.

109
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.310
That's all.

110
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.030
Sorry.

111
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.280
I just used it only for the top 80.

112
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.840
Okay.

113
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.910
Youth culture and excessive.

114
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.980
Okay.

115
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.990
Great.

116
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.980
Or probably we can just see 90.

117
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.370
Okay.

118
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.830
Great.

119
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.690
I think this is fine.

120
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.170
Right.

121
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.860
Okay, guys, see you in this lecture.
