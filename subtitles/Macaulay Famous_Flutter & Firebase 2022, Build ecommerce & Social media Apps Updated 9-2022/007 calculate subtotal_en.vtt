Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.660
Walker In this lecture, they're going to calculate the sub total.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.650
Okay, then they need to do this.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.820
We're going to need to go back to Our Vinci Code and then.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.760
The card items screen, and now we can then use control and be in the dark to make this white.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.100
Okay.

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.840
I want to go to the top and just going to do this over here.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.230
Okay.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.030
Now we are going to create a double variable and we are going to call this variable sub total.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
Is going to be equal to the on the score cards.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.010
Archibald's Darts Prize ten times.

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.360
Times on the score cards.

13
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.960
Archibald Dodds quantity.

14
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.410
Okay.

15
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.090
So we are simply saying we want two times the price with our many products we want.

16
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.690
Okay, nice control and save.

17
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.100
And then scroll down to.

18
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.210
Okay, where we are able to solve to do.

19
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.740
Okay.

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.680
We're going to get rid of this and use this.

21
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.900
Use this and a dollar sign and then core the subtitle.

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.930
Okay, this control is to save.

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.740
Okay.

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.780
You're going to see it now.

25
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.710
Okay, great.

26
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.160
Okay.

27
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.930
Now, currently we said we want to do what we can as well.

28
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.680
Cee Lo wants just one per ounce, so he's going to calculate how many products we want, right?

29
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.980
Okay.

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.140
Currently we have one.

31
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.360
We have two products.

32
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.660
Right.

33
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.610
So we are simply saying we want to order to Gucci of our size shot.

34
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.970
Okay.

35
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.870
Well, we can say no, we don't really need to, but we just need one.

36
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.200
Okay.

37
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.190
This will give us the price of one because it comprises like $99.99.

38
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.610
Right.

39
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.990
So we times this price by I mean the products we want, we should refer to as the quantity set.

40
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.330
Right.

41
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.650
Okay.

42
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.650
You can see.

43
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.560
Sounds good, right?

44
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.920
Okay.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.270
Okay.

46
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.110
