00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.680
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.840
In this section, we're going to start creating the functionality in order to upload the video.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.260
Okay.

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.370
Not to do this, we're going to need to go to the controller's directory and over here we're going to

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.830
create a new file and we can call this upload on this video, then on this call controller.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.870
And then there's section dot.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.290
Dot.

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.710
Okay.

10
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.890
Now all we need to do first is to create a class and we can then call this class.

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.090
Sorry, not art.

12
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.560
Upload video and controller.

13
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.700
Okay.

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.780
Okay.

15
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.240
Not in step is to create a function in order to be able to upload the picture video.

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.660
Okay.

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.630
So we can call this upload video.

18
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.980
Okay.

19
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.070
Now, we are not just going to upload the video.

20
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.430
Right.

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.700
We are also going to upload the capture of the video and as well the song name of the video.

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.910
So all we can do is we can pass in all those fields.

23
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.690
Okay.

24
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.010
So over here.

25
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.120
Well, there we can.

26
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.080
Okay.

27
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.270
The song name is going to be a test, right?

28
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.800
So we can just go ahead and specify it is a data type of string and we can then say a song name and

29
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.120
as well string.

30
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.600
And.

31
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.690
Cap shunt.

32
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.660
Okay, great.

33
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.570
And all the parts to the video, sir.

34
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.450
So there's going to be a string, and you can also call this video part.

35
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.610
Okay, great.

36
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.250
Okay, great.

37
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.510
Great.

38
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.830
Great.

39
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.520
Great, great.

40
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.270
Okay.

41
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.720
And now we can then use a try and a catch block.

42
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.450
I think you've seen something similar to this.

43
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.090
Right.

44
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.440
Okay.

45
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.580
Okay.

46
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.820
Now, the first and we're going to need to do is we are going to get the current logged in user that

47
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.010
is always uploading the.

48
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.710
What is posted on the video link is to do that.

49
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.280
We can go ahead and say strength and unity is going to be equal to five firebase.

50
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.950
Hopefully we have that somewhere.

51
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.190
Okay.

52
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.600
Fabulous arts dot.

53
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.350
Dirt currencies and we can just get the UID out of this or via this.

54
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.870
It can.

55
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.380
It can't be.

56
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.750
No.

57
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.710
Okay.

58
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.510
So if I doubt that Kevin is going to get rid of this.

59
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.640
Okay.

60
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.980
And although we can dent had this.

61
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.730
Okay.

62
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.840
Okay.

63
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.540
Now, the next step is we are going to get to the user.

64
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.320
Okay.

65
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.320
Now you're going to see why we are doing this later in the course.

66
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.280
Definitely.

67
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.330
You might not understand all the process now, but later in the course you're going to see why we are

68
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.680
doing all this.

69
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.580
So we are going to get the user from the first user from the database that is the user's collection.

70
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.020
Okay.

71
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.890
Not to do this all what we just have to say is we can create a variable called user doc and we can specify

72
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.510
it is a type of what documents snapshot because I guess in each are getting a single document documents

73
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.530
and I'm sure it and.

74
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.880
It's going to be equal to.

75
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.740
I think we have to have these.

76
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.290
For our base.

77
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.400
Hopefully we do.

78
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.240
Fabric storage and dot.

79
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.000
Okay.

80
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.740
I think we have in the course their tree accent.

81
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.240
We call this faster.

82
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.190
Faster.

83
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.560
The is going to check this quickly, I think, in the course.

84
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.360
You see what we called it?

85
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.360
Okay.

86
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.760
Yeah.

87
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.170
We called it faster.

88
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.620
Okay.

89
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.820
Q We can go back to this and.

90
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.970
Okay.

91
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.500
Fire.

92
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.950
Sir.

93
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.430
Okay, collection.

94
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.460
Then you're going to have access to the users collection, right?

95
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.290
And what we can then do is assess historic.

96
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.250
These documents.

97
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.730
Why?

98
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.860
I said the document, not these documents.

99
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.110
Then you are headed by the UID.

100
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.010
That is the current.

101
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.130
Is your idea, right.

102
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.780
Once we want to simply get the comments logged in user.

103
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.230
Okay.

104
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.500
Then we can simply say dot gets.

105
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.070
Okay.

106
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.480
Okay.

107
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.080
Okay.

108
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.160
I think we have this error, so all we need to do is to.

109
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.160
Passing the acyclovir because it takes some time and over a year we needs to wait for it.

110
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.870
You can just use control and B to make this work.

111
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.270
Okay.

112
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.640
Great.

113
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.840
Now the next step is to we are just going to assume we have uploaded the videos.

114
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.280
So we're going to retrieve that video and then we're going to compress it.

115
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.300
Okay, you're going to see this.

116
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.690
Okay.

117
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.140
So what we can do is we can then see all we can do is we can.

118
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.410
They say all dogs create a variable called our dogs.

119
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.660
And it's going to be equal to.

120
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.110
As we'll have these.

121
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.620
Sorry.

122
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.370
Faster.

123
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.270
Darts collection and we can just assume we have video uploaded a video and darts.

124
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.900
Gets the okay.

125
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.040
All dogs.

126
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.600
Okay.

127
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.860
We are going to need to specify.

128
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.170
It is a type of words.

129
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.190
Documents.

130
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.750
Snapshot.

131
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.710
The key.

132
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.980
Documents now.

133
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.690
Okay.

134
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.100
And.

135
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.860
It's very easy to understand.

136
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.870
You're going to see all this very soon.

137
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.350
Okay.

138
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.760
And over here, I think we need to pass this or dogs await their collection.

139
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.300
Okay.

140
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.600
The collection.

141
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.240
Okay.

142
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.340
I think we have some issues.

143
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.870
Okay.

144
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.280
Sorry.

145
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.650
Sorry.

146
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.710
We don't really need this.

147
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.440
We just have to specify.

148
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.020
It is a type of var, so any type of variable or any type.

149
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.370
Okay.

150
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.460
Great.

151
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.940
Okay, great.

152
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.990
Now, the next step to do is to get how many videos we have uploaded so far.

153
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.730
That is the length of how many videos we have in the videos collection.

154
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.150
Okay.

155
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.190
Now, to do this, all you have to say is you can specify it is it is going to be a number, I'd say

156
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.650
is the type of intent lent that is going to be equal to this all dogs.

157
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.040
Or dogs.

158
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.830
Then we can just see darts.

159
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.260
The thing about dogs.

160
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.980
So all dogs than dogs that's is each dog, that is each document.

161
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.230
So okay, we are trying to count how many videos we have uploaded so far.

162
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.710
Right.

163
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.170
So we are checking we are saying all dogs, the dogs that is won't assess each documents.

164
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.810
Then you can see I can see that was I made it because I going to be assessed in each document compared

165
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:23.470
to over a year where we are seeing document snapshots, which means we are just getting a single document.

166
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.310
Okay, to all dogs, dogs, dogs.

167
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.140
Then we can then see that length.

168
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.770
Okay.

169
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.730
And over here are this.

170
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.960
Okay, great.

171
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.250
Now the next step is to upload this video to discourage.

172
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.270
Right.

173
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.650
I think you've seen all this before.

174
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.790
So what we can do is over here, we can just say.

175
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.870
Uploading.

176
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.130
Video.

177
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.000
So age.

178
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.180
So h hopefully I can spell.

179
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.770
Okay.

180
00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.230
Sorry.

181
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.590
The case.

182
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.620
Okay.

183
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.810
Now we are going to create the function.

184
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.780
We can just make this a private function by saying, well, this car.

185
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.240
That's okay, that's me is remember I says is variable outside the fly.

186
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.050
And on this call you can see upload video.

187
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.660
To storage.

188
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.720
So it's okay.

189
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.870
And now we can pass on dynamic fields we need.

190
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.080
So whenever we call this function, Lebanon need to pass the value to it.

191
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.490
Okay.

192
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:39.400
So over here, we can pass the idea of the video string.

193
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.140
I'd hand as well the video parts.

194
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.710
That's what they're going to be uploading, right?

195
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.780
Video parts.

196
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.710
Okay.

197
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.450
And now we can easily upload the video.

198
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.760
By saying, rev, and we can specify the type.

199
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.530
It is a type of reference.

200
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.540
With.

201
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.060
I think.

202
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.710
Okay, this.

203
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:05.770
Okay.

204
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.980
And now we can say is equal to five days.

205
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.930
Fabio Sturridge, then dartboard darts ref rights.

206
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.730
Okay, we can call the name of the fodder we had.

207
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.100
The videos are going to be uploaded.

208
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.090
We can call it videos and then go chide the chide.

209
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.220
Simply make the animal defiant.

210
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.570
It can be the Heidi.

211
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.380
Okay.

212
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.920
This I'd.

213
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:36.340
Okay.

214
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.650
Okay, great.

215
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.210
Now what we can do is we can then we can call that function over here.

216
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.830
Upload what's.

217
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.320
Okay.

218
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.390
You can see it wants us to pass the the I.D. for the value.

219
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.260
What we can see is we can't just see videos, so we.

220
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.940
Videos, then you can use the dollar sign to see Lent.

221
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.350
Okay.

222
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.890
That's.

223
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:03.880
It's going to be.

224
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.580
It's good to arm video we have.

225
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:07.930
Right.

226
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:14.290
So if it is if it is the first video, the idea and the modify of that's video uploaded is going to

227
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.590
be 10456 and so on.

228
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.010
Okay.

229
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.080
And.

230
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.370
As well.

231
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.180
We need this.

232
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:23.930
Okay.

233
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.090
Now you're going to upload the video to uphold it.

234
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.410
You've already seen us before.

235
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.970
We can then say rest.

236
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.050
Thoughts put.

237
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.610
Fine.

238
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.000
Okay.

239
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.280
And simply say, do with your parts.

240
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.360
Okay.

241
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.820
Now, before you go for the.

242
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:49.500
What we need to do is we are going to need to compress that video before uploading it so we don't have

243
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.390
consumption of data.

244
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.250
So we need to first upload.

245
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.590
So Melody's uploading it.

246
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.670
We need to first compressed, compressed video before it gets uploaded.

247
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.120
Okay.

248
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.370
With that, we are going to have used video, but they're going to have just the two sides.

249
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:05.760
Okay.

250
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.300
So that's what I think we're just going to do that in the next lecture.

251
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:16.530
So before and then we can just commit this of so in case you calls this, you can easily just rerun

252
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.250
it later.

253
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:17.640
Okay?

254
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.160
Like we do understand all this is totally fine.

255
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.680
As the process goes, you can understand everything.

256
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.340
Probably.

257
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.280
We're going to come back to all this later, okay?

258
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.680
Okay, guys, see you.

259
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.550
And in this lecture.
