00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.950
Our guys welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.750
We are going to pass our products to our product detail screen.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
Now to do this, we are going to use this which you've seen before.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.950
And over here we are going to create a final variable and we can see it's going to be a type of dynamic.

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.310
So it allows any type of value and we are going to call this variable product.

6
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.160
Least.

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.000
And how do you semi-colon.

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.490
And the next step is to pass it on to the constructor.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.810
To do that, you have to alight in use control and then create constructor for final fields.

10
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.390
And you can see why it's automatically passed and required.

11
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.120
And whenever we call this product detail screen, we have to pass the value to this variable called

12
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.270
product list.

13
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.720
And over here, you can see we are calling the product details screen.

14
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.360
Where?

15
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.610
Okay.

16
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.230
Yeah.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.890
Okay.

18
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.080
So now we have to pass the value to this variable called product.

19
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.350
Her dad's list.

20
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.810
Right.

21
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.370
Okay.

22
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.400
Product list and the value is going to be these products.

23
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.980
OC products and this is basically it.

24
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.460
And currently we have successfully passed our.

25
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.850
Products data from this screen to the product detail screen.

26
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.410
So now we can use that data back to the product data screen.

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:01.410
And as you know, currently this variable called product list has access to a lot of values, such as

28
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:10.259
the the price of the product, the description of the products, the image of the products, the title

29
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.850
of the product and so on.

30
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.450
Right.

31
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.590
So what we have to do is to have access to the image of the product.

32
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.030
Right.

33
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.510
Okay.

34
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.040
So in order to make this cleaner, we can.

35
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.040
Creates another variable within the build over.

36
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.180
Yeah.

37
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.200
We can just go ahead and specify the type of variable.

38
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.870
It's going to be a list of images.

39
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.440
Right.

40
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.450
And we can also make this.

41
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.620
Finer and least and we are expecting strings as the images, right.

42
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.620
So what we can just do instead of saying strings, we can just say dynamic to say it can be string or

43
00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.360
any type of variable and we can then call this variable images, right?

44
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.820
Because a single product can have up to three images.

45
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.480
Right?

46
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.150
And now we're going to say it's equal to this variable called products.

47
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.510
Product list.

48
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.750
And use this.

49
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.950
And we basically just want to assess the product image.

50
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.730
The semicolon.

51
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.580
And we have to get rid of this now.

52
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.960
Okay.

53
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.400
It's ends over here and we have to call the images.

54
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.900
Images and we want to assess this image by they are indents.

55
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.810
And this is of having the static value of it.

56
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.220
We can then get rid of it and call the images and.

57
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.710
Okay.

58
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.780
Images.

59
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.650
That.

60
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.810
The lengths oc OC is concerned to save.

61
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.150
And.

62
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.440
Okay.

63
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.260
Okay.

64
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.190
And we just have to go back and maybe click on this.

65
00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.990
Okay.

66
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.110
We just have to restart.

67
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.560
You can see it's trying to fetch from the network, right?

68
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.230
So we have to restart this.

69
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.790
Okay.

70
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.510
It's going to take some time to.

71
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.570
Well, let's restart.

72
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.520
You just have to try us out.

73
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.580
Och.

74
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.740
Och, it's done.

75
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.600
And we can then try and for the email we have to say a famous.

76
00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:00.720
Store or you can just log into the customer account and this is going to be E, g, c and now log in.

77
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.620
Okay.

78
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.520
Mr..

79
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.170
I think we are missing the E and click on log in.

80
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.830
Okay.

81
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.150
Currently we have this product and click on this.

82
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.640
You can see now.

83
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.300
Okay.

84
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.880
Okay, Cisco.

85
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.930
It's going to take some time.

86
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.370
Okay.

87
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.160
And instead of dots, we can then use the fraction.

88
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.790
Fraction and these constraints save.

89
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.740
And you can see one over here.

90
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:42.000
Look, you can see this is the second image and this is the first and okay we have just to images for

91
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.350
this product and we can check for.

92
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.220
This one.

93
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.060
Okay.

94
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.880
We have to images as well.

95
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.630
And.

96
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.410
What about the women?

97
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.320
Okay.

98
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.880
And this.

99
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.050
And we have.

100
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.490
Two images, I think just two images.

101
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.130
There should be.

102
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.330
Okay.

103
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.890
I think we have to.

104
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.800
Okay.

105
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.660
Just one image over for that product and.

106
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:30.920
We have up to three images for this product as taking some time to load because you can see we are fetching

107
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.570
from the network.

108
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.590
Okay.

109
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.300
Cisco.

110
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.040
Cisco.

111
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.480
Cisco.

112
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.010
Right.

113
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.640
Okay.

114
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.800
Electronics.

115
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.770
Okay.

116
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.610
For iPhone or plasma I think we have just to Siri images.

117
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.420
Okay.

118
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.200
Cool.

119
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.830
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
