00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.280
WALKER In this lecture, Urban also working on digital pitch.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.720
Now we're going to take this.

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.390
We get further and this off screen as the front page you are.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.860
So what I want to do is what is create directory of folder ribbon to create a new folder and they're

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.780
going to call this folder detail.

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.320
Then over is detail.

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.110
You're going to create a new FY and you're going to call this detail on this score.

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.630
Page then?

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.220
Darts.

11
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.710
Darts.

12
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.840
And now we can use control and B, to make this right.

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.200
And then we can go to set this widget as well.

14
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.440
We can call this detail page.

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.840
And over a year you're going to need to alight and then use control and ODS in order to impart the material

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.860
to that package.

17
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.650
Now, since we are going to Fred's page, this is not going to be a container, but it's going to be

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.280
a scaffold.

19
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.459
Now, to give that wide background and also to have access to lots of properties, okay, for the now

20
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:11.400
we can have a body, then a centre that stands out, in which case we're going to use then the child,

21
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.070
then the test we did, then the test is going to say detail page for now.

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.690
Okay, determine how to train the coma and use control this suit.

23
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.810
Now what you're going to do next is when the user clicks on any of these products, they're going to

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.980
be able to navigate to the detail page.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.270
Okay.

26
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.840
To do this, we will need to use control and be in order to make this smaller.

27
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.660
And then they're going to need to go to the product, the single product design and visit over here.

28
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.250
You can just bring this to product I item, right?

29
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.630
Okay.

30
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.160
And now we can use control and B to make this white.

31
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.160
So you can see over here we have the chart, which is the card widget.

32
00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.880
And you can see this card we get as a father and every other widget such as the test, the prize, everything

33
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880
in the image is inside this card, right?

34
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.840
So you can rub this card with a bottle.

35
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.250
So we need to highlight.

36
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.500
Then you've got your own daughter.

37
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.370
And since we don't have this, we get over here.

38
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.900
We can then go with rap, which we did, then double easy gesture detector.

39
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.820
You can also use the equal gesture detector button.

40
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.660
In this gesture, the detector has a property known as on tap.

41
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.260
So we can get great information in over here.

42
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.610
We can do Navigator.

43
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.700
That's of course, contest.

44
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.530
Then that push.

45
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.880
Want to push the dinosaur out?

46
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.760
Okay.

47
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.560
These are the roots.

48
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.580
These are going to be.

49
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.360
We are.

50
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.380
Page roots.

51
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.160
Okay.

52
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.750
Now for the builder.

53
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.980
Get rid of this.

54
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.440
The Apprentice is in the contest.

55
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.120
You can specify the type.

56
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.580
It is a beauty contest, but it is not really necessary.

57
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.890
We can just get rid of that.

58
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.820
And then right after this last apprentice is sorry.

59
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.620
That is for us princesses.

60
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.130
You can then use an eye reflection.

61
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.990
That's once.

62
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.260
No.

63
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.150
Go to the detail page.

64
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.990
Okay.

65
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.560
The semicolon and then use this in order to actually start and save those on, say, twice.

66
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.560
Or you can just put your your vehicle automatic.

67
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.320
What's a savior?

68
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.120
Okay.

69
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.020
Now we can then click on this.

70
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.860
Okay.

71
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.790
You can see it over the detail page.

72
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.530
Now, what it going to do list is you're going to pass the product item.

73
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.910
The little paths of product to the detail page.

74
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.260
Okay.

75
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.460
To do that, we are in digital.

76
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.780
We are in the product item design.

77
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.370
Right.

78
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.680
Okay.

79
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.600
So you have in the past is able via.

80
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.130
Remember, this rainbow is more like a container.

81
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.200
That stores all the clothes we have.

82
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.880
And for the now we just have.

83
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.250
Too close.

84
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.690
So it's a products.

85
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.690
I told you to rename this to product, right?

86
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.019
Because we're not only going to have closed related products, but every type of products.

87
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.410
Okay.

88
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.850
So.

89
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.760
So this is a variable that stores those two products.

90
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.300
Okay.

91
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.540
So that we can pass it on to this detail page.

92
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.850
So we're really say close.

93
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.320
Okay, great.

94
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.880
Then you can see we are this era because we need to accept this variable or this data that is been passed

95
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.620
to this page.

96
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.650
You can use control.

97
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.220
Then we can then go to detail page.

98
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.610
Okay.

99
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.180
Over here.

100
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.270
A little creative, a variable.

101
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.110
Where you're going, like we're just going to go ahead and specify the type it is the type of clothes,

102
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.000
then the rebel clothes.

103
00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.420
Okay.

104
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.650
Now, since we are set in argument.

105
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:12.240
They're going to take a new shift instead of using this of the past to construct something different.

106
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.680
So the use, the constructs, first of all, create a construct that is the tale page.

107
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.300
So all we just have to say is this it's close.

108
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.770
Okay.

109
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.530
And how to use the vehicle of the valet.

110
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.270
We don't really need this since we just want to accept this variable.

111
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.280
If you had that, I think you're going to get an error.

112
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:43.920
Okay, now we have access to those products so we can get rid of this all the way is we can hide the

113
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.640
dollar sign.

114
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.210
Then this is going to be close dot product name.

115
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.930
Okay.

116
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.120
It is going to hold three stages.

117
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.540
Okay.

118
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.410
How to start?

119
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.750
Okay.

120
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.140
Okay.

121
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.560
Okay.

122
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.980
Okay.

123
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.460
Okay.

124
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.780
Okay.

125
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.680
Okay.

126
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.430
Click on this.

127
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.800
Okay.

128
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.550
Go see the size you can see.

129
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.320
You can click on this.

130
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.830
You can see it's been passed.

131
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.800
Okay, there's the pass.

132
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.000
And that's what we can do is we can get rid of this sitter.

133
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.720
And then we can use a column widget.

134
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:36.890
So in order for us to have access to lots of property, then to do it right now we are going to have

135
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:44.480
to stock widgets because on top of that image is going to be on how true to how true that is to go back

136
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.770
to the previous page.

137
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.220
Okay.

138
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.960
I remember we used to place widget in top widget is going to be stuck.

139
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.980
Stark, then children.

140
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.860
Then the first child is going to be a container.

141
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.630
That is a huge container.

142
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.480
For the heart.

143
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.930
That's how long it's going to be.

144
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.120
You're going to see 500.

145
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.350
Okay.

146
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.810
Great.

147
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.340
Now you're going to have the decoration is going to be box decoration.

148
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.650
And now we can have the image is going to be decoration.

149
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.290
The Coalition image rights.

150
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.330
You've seen this before, right?

151
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.750
Okay.

152
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:29.450
Now you can see this arrow, because what it wants is to pass the argument or one important image is

153
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.440
going to be has sets.

154
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.600
Asus.

155
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.730
Image, then decision to close.

156
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.280
Dot MHRA help.

157
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.610
Okay.

158
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.240
We can convert it to strength or use the other way.

159
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.820
I just.

160
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.410
I just showed you this string.

161
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.170
So those two string.

162
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.030
Okay.

163
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.000
How did you come to.

164
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.120
I'm trying this to save.

165
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.620
Okay.

166
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.860
You can see it over here, right?

167
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.250
Okay.

168
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.350
Now what we can do is.

169
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.750
Over after the its image returned to the commercial image.

170
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.370
We can just how they come away.

171
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.960
Not very good from that.

172
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.300
Okay.

173
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.600
Well, you know something?

174
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.350
The last field.

175
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.110
I tried to show you this before, but we didn't see it in action.

176
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.520
I study speculative books.

177
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.200
Books filled.

178
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.360
A field.

179
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.610
Right field.

180
00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:35.950
This controversy.

181
00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:39.940
Okay.

182
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.419
Great.

183
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.240
Now, I think this is way too sharp right over here.

184
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.260
So what you can then do we tend to.

185
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.500
Was decoration.

186
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:57.190
Not the decoration elevation they're going to see, but whether hideous is going to bother is.

187
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.070
That circular.

188
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.660
Oh 25.

189
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.860
Let's see what it does.

190
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.670
Okay.

191
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.960
Okay.

192
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.370
I think this is way too more like a love letter.

193
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.170
Okay.

194
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.530
What I mean what I'm talking about The Last Airbender.

195
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.730
If you push that.

196
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.370
Okay, I'm just going to go with ten.

197
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.370
Okay.

198
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:32.870
Great.

199
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.250
Okay.

200
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.170
I think it's okay.

201
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.890
Right.

202
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.280
Okay.

203
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.450
Now, let's try to go back and click on this.

204
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.050
Okay.

205
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:42.860
Okay.

206
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.070
So.

207
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.370
Well.

208
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.390
Okay, guys.

209
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.860
See you in the next picture.
