00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.660
In this lecture, we are going to create the subcategory screen.

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.710
And in order to make this cleaner, what we can do is within the views directory we are going to create

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.940
a new folder and we are going to call this folder miner on the score screens.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.800
And within the miner on the screens, we are going to create a new file and we are going to call this

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.100
sub on the score category, on the score screen and the dart.

8
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.600
And now we can use Control D and we can just create a stateless widget since we basically not going

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.530
to update the UI stateless widget and sub category screen.

10
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:58.080
And over here we need to allow it and these control dots import the material that that package and now

11
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.750
we can get rid of this constructor.

12
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.650
And.

13
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.660
Over the side.

14
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.430
We can just have.

15
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.840
A color for now and all those that may be read.

16
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.600
Okay.

17
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.520
And what we want to do is whenever a user clicks on any of this, we want to take the user to the subcategory

18
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.180
screen.

19
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440
To do that, we have to head back to the category screen.

20
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.550
And.

21
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.080
Sorry.

22
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.690
Not there, but the man.

23
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.900
That's a good screen.

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.440
And over this column, we're going to wrap it with a button to do that, a light and use control and

25
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.540
not wrap with widgets.

26
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.900
And we're going to wrap this with a gesture detector.

27
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.230
And as well, you can wrap this with an inkwell.

28
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
It has a property known as on tap, same as the inkwell.

29
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.300
And we can then say Navigator.

30
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.170
Navigator Dot.

31
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.890
What?

32
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.530
So we can just go ahead and say push.

33
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.669
You can see it automatically.

34
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.500
Also pass the contest.

35
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.090
And for the roots, this is called Materia.

36
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.420
Paid roots.

37
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.680
And it can take the contest.

38
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.050
And most of the time you do not really need to pass the beauty contest or to specify the type.

39
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.950
And over year.

40
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.260
We can then return the sub category.

41
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.410
Subcategory screen.

42
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.280
Okay.

43
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.640
And I think.

44
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.430
Okay.

45
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.450
I like it.

46
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.430
This contract, it's important.

47
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.110
Okay.

48
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.230
We start.

49
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.580
Okay.

50
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.030
I think we are having.

51
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.600
Okay.

52
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.340
Get rid of this.

53
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.060
Over the.

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.850
And we have to maybe how to start again.

55
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.810
You can see we are having this issue about.

56
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.040
Yeah and it's basically want us to convert this to stateful widgets since all this data are basically

57
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.920
dynamic, we're going to sort out that later.

58
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.580
Okay.

59
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.740
We just have to wait for this and.

60
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.040
And and you can check it out now.

61
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.890
And it's hard to start this up for sure.

62
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.890
Category and the man we can click on this link, you can see and now we can then continue.

63
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.580
Over the subcategory screen.

64
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.210
We can then get rid of this and change this to a scaffold.

65
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.600
Scaffold.

66
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.610
Scaffold.

67
00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.440
And we basically need a high bar, high bar and sushi bar.

68
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.130
And as you know, they have our.

69
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.110
So.

70
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.940
But.

71
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.080
Okay.

72
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.850
This country needs to save.

73
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.860
And is it going to get rid of this color?

74
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.580
Okay, great.

75
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.440
And what we want to do is we want to pass the data that is the name of the category.

76
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.230
Which is the name of the the the name of the category.

77
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.370
And that is the test we have via.

78
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.460
To.

79
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.290
To this place that is as the as the title of the harbor.

80
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.630
To do that, what we have to do is over the sub category.

81
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:58.130
We are going to create a finer variable and we are going to call this sub category.

82
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.030
Name and.

83
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.610
We are splitting the test.

84
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.150
So it's going to be a type of string and now we have to align these contain dots to create constructor

85
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.290
for final fields.

86
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.110
Okay, great.

87
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.990
And now we are going to have this error because we are making this required.

88
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.220
So any time we call this subcategory screen, we have to pass the value to that variable.

89
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.630
Okay.

90
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.470
Over here.

91
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.830
So over here, we need to call the subcategory name, and we're going to pass the main.

92
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.650
And we just have to say the indents of it all to start this again.

93
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.310
Well, we start hopefully understand what we are trying to do.

94
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.800
Okay.

95
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.150
We just have to.

96
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.080
Or should we start this and go check it out?

97
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.590
You know how to start this for sure.

98
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.970
Sorry for delays.

99
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.620
Okay.

100
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.020
And men, click on this.

101
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.000
Okay.

102
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.510
We have to display it over there.

103
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.810
Right.

104
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.470
Okay.

105
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.650
Back to the main.

106
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.840
So the subcategory.

107
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.320
And we need the title.

108
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.480
It is a test and we are going to pass the sub category name.

109
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.920
This country needs to save.

110
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.210
Okay.

111
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.150
Look, you can see and we can take this to the center.

112
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.900
The harbor has a property known as center title.

113
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.330
Okay.

114
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.450
We can just use this arrow to go back.

115
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.170
And t shirts.

116
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.030
You're going to see the t shirt over there.

117
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.430
We could just get rid of this.

118
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.170
Okay.

119
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.190
And what we can also do.

120
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.160
We can be sure of this.

121
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.550
Page.

122
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.000
The screen is the is for the main category.

123
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.270
So what we can do is we send the so it's in the scaffold, we can have the body.

124
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.570
And for the body we can have a sense of with that child.

125
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.010
And what we can also do is we can say finer and we can call this.

126
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.930
You can just go ahead and specify.

127
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.530
We are expecting the test and then category.

128
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.620
Main category.

129
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:42.040
And we have to pass this on to the constructor by saying required and this dot main category.

130
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.100
Okay for.

131
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.410
This is going to be a test and we can then say man category.

132
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.550
Okay.

133
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.010
This would basically tell us the subcategory screen we are currently in.

134
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.770
Okay.

135
00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.240
Yeah.

136
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.940
We need to pass this and then category.

137
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.280
We can then say, man.

138
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.240
Right.

139
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.840
Okay.

140
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.430
And if you create this for if you create because over here you're going to create a new categories.

141
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.670
Right, for the women.

142
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.270
You're also going to specify that it is a women category.

143
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.290
That is the women's category.

144
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:19.910
Sorry.

145
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.410
Okay.

146
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.810
We have to basically how to start this.

147
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.940
And hopefully we have no errors.

148
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:32.720
Okay.

149
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.400
But we start then.

150
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.179
He's going know how to start this.

151
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.550
And this you can see men.

152
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.760
And for the women, we have currently not viewed darts, but definitely we are going to have something

153
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.380
similar to this over here.

154
00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.370
And we can basically just copy all this and create a new screen and that therefore the main category

155
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.810
that is going to be women.

156
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.470
Okay.

157
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.890
And now we're going to sort out this.

158
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.670
What we can just do is.

159
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.890
Within the.

160
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.790
Within the lead territory.

161
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:17.790
We can create a new folder and we can call this Youth SEAL Leach's.

162
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.970
And for this utilities, we can then create a new file.

163
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.270
We can call this category on the score list, then the dot.

164
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.120
And.

165
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.640
Over the main categories.

166
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.810
We can then call this off from the air and definitely we're going to have that error since it is no

167
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.370
longer defined and we have to face this via.

168
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.160
And now we then need to import.

169
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.250
A light and import OC that is all.

170
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.940
And over here you can see we are using the static lens.

171
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.720
Right.

172
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.800
So instead of this, we can get rid of that and say, man, that's.

173
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.880
That lends.

174
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.600
Okay.

175
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:17.470
And this is basically everything you need to know on how to create a category and a sub category.

176
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:24.170
So I think this should be the end of this section, but before then we can just go ahead and try to

177
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.740
see.

178
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.450
Everything is working the same.

179
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:36.590
And currently we want to buy a product from the main category because I'm guy and if you're a woman

180
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.470
you can just go to this your category section and try to do this yourself.

181
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.250
It's going to be similar to that of the man.

182
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.140
You can basically just copy the codes and.

183
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.710
I want to support cheese from this subcategory of this shirt.

184
00:10:53.100 --> 00:11:00.210
And this will basically tell me I'm currently in the men subcategory, right, for the women.

185
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.720
After clicking on the subcategory, it's going to say women to tell the user, Hey, you're currently

186
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.470
in the you're currently in the women subcategory.

187
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.780
So that was why I basically did that.

188
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.250
And you can see we're basically parsing the title.

189
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.460
And lastly, we can just tie this.

190
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.500
Okay.

191
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.640
Back to.

192
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.120
The minor screens.

193
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:24.740
Okay.

194
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:31.480
And we can then set the hub bar, the two colors of white.

195
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.930
And you're not going to see that again, right.

196
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.900
Since it has the color of white.

197
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.560
And now we are setting this to white.

198
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.500
And you can see the test also has a color of white.

199
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:50.230
So for the icon, we can then say icon team and it's going to be icon team data.

200
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.640
So I can't seem.

201
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.190
Data.

202
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.450
And it has a color.

203
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.890
So you can then see colors the black.

204
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:08.250
And for the test, we can then have a style, test, style.

205
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.010
And change the color to colors that block.

206
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.060
Okay.

207
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.260
And we need that news conference is save and everything is going to work fine now.

208
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.760
And we can get rid of that shadow by saying elevation to zero.

209
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.270
The key is control, say.

210
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.850
Okay.

211
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.790
Sounds good.

212
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.010
And codes.

213
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.420
Okay.

214
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.270
Sounds good.

215
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.350
Look, guys.

216
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.240
See you in the next section.
