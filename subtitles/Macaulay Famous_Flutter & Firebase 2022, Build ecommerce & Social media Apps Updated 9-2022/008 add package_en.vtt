12
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.770
Then in order to have this package, we need to copy the code and.

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.670
Back to our vehicle and then locate the prospect of ammo and we to had this right after the Cupertino

And copy.

27
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.060
The Court and.

28
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.630
Paste it over here.

29
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.260

Okay.

39
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.930
I think this is taking longer.

40
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.310
Okay.

41
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.830
Now the next package we need is the cloud faster.

So as well we need to copy the court and.

45
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.250
Paste Okay.

46
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.100
Now we're going to be integrating the Google sign in, right?

47
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.020
So as well, we need the package.

48
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
So to compare the damage and that's to go back to the home screen.

49
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.560
And then we're going to search for Google or sign in.

50
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.850
Okay.

51
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.710
Book signing and click on this.

52
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.840
And then.

53
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.110
Is this okay?

54
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
And now we can use control and s to save enough.

55
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.800

Okay.

59
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.800
This is gonna take some time, and then it's gonna be done, and.

60
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.260
Most of the time it is recommended you restart your vehicle.

61
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.770
Okay.

62
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.380
