00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.990
Hi.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.910
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.050
In this lecture, we are going to store the impact of the user to a variable.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.430
Okay, now to do this, first of all, we need to create a variable and this is going to be for the

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.450
price.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.050
And since we are not giving it a value at this moment, we can say it's going to be a type of lit and

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.160
it's also going to be a type of double, which is a type of decimal or a variable that has the decimal

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.710
point that is the dot and we're going to call this variable price.

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.820
Or we can we can just go with price and it's going to be empty and also.

10
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.290
When we mean double, we are basically referring to numbers like this.

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.060
Ten dots, nine.

12
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.490
Nine.

13
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.140
Right.

14
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.740
Okay.

15
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.980
And now we are going to create a variable to store the value that is the quantity value.

16
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.019
And this is also going to be a late then it's going to be a type of int that is the number which had

17
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.510
the similar maybe hundred and 200, 200 and so on.

18
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.150
Okay.

19
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.200
So it's going to be a type of INT and we're going to call this quantity.

20
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.320
Quantity.

21
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.980
Okay.

22
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.260
And the next variable we have to create is for the product name.

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.460
Okay.

24
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.940
We can say late.

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.540
And it's going to be that type of string because it is a test and we're going to call this product name.

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.360
Product name.

27
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.870
And the last variable we need is for the product description.

28
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.310
And it is also going to be a test and we can then say products.

29
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.690
Description.

30
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.010
Okay, great.

31
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.830
And now we have to use all these variables to do that within the test phone field.

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.070
Okay.

33
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.890
This is for the price within the test home field.

34
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.220
It has a property known as on change, which is a callback.

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.160
And within the parentheses we're going to pass in the value which is referring to whatsoever input.

36
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.750
This is going to type in.

37
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.360
And now what we can say is price is going to be equal to.

38
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.940
Valley.

39
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.000
Okay.

40
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.190
And now you can see we have this error.

41
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.180
And the reason for this error is because the value is expecting.

42
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.260
A string is especially string as a value.

43
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.380
You can see value of type string can't be assigned to a variable of type double.

44
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.670
So you can see basically is is a pattern it test, right?

45
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.600
So what we can do, we can convert this value to a double.

46
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.980
And to do that, we have to say double.

47
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.460
Double dot pos.

48
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.140
Dirt.

49
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.100
Boer.

50
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.520
Dubber Okay, so.

51
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.000
Hopefully I can spare double.

52
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.090
Double dot pass and pass in the value.

53
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.480
Okay.

54
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.290
Simms Good.

55
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.010
And we also need to do that for the quantity.

56
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.070
Quantity and value on change value.

57
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.270
And now we have to say, what quantity?

58
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.580
Quantity is going to be equal to value.

59
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.200
And of course, it is a pattern, a data type of string.

60
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.990
So what we have to do, we have to convert this the string to and he'd like to do that.

61
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.580
We have to say Heinz.

62
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.200
It's.

63
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.940
Hence the -- pass.

64
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.760
And now we have to pass the value.

65
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.900
Okay.

66
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.740
Seems good.

67
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.460
And we also need to do this for the product name.

68
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.000
Product name and change.

69
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.830
Value.

70
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.160
And what we have to say now is product name.

71
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.980
Product name is equal to value and, you know, default, it is a specified string.

72
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.550
So we don't need to do any further configuration.

73
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.720
And lastly.

74
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.340
The OC on change.

75
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.430
Value.

76
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.150
And now you can say product description.

77
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.520
It's going to be equal to value.

78
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.110
Seems good.

79
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.410
And what we can also do, we can just print out the result.

80
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.880
If it is valid, then what we simply want to do is to print out the the prize.

81
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.370
Trains the quantity.

82
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.900
And.

83
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.650
Com.

84
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.490
See?

85
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.050
Quantity OC.

86
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.770
And price.

87
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.340
So print's product name.

88
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.950
Put that name.

89
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.680
And Prince.

90
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.150
Product description.

91
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.270
Okay.

92
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.830
Hopefully I spell to this.

93
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.220
I think I think I spelt it wrong.

94
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.710
And this is going to be quantity.

95
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.470
One key.

96
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.870
What's the dry spell?

97
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.010
Quantity.

98
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.560
I think my spelling is wrong.

99
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.950
This is not the spelling of quantity.

100
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.410
And I'm just going to copy from this.

101
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.120
Okay.

102
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.200
This should be the spelling of quantity.

103
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.470
I think I did seem.

104
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.390
Okay.

105
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.970
Is concerned.

106
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.790
As I say, we're just going to change that later if it is not correct.

107
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.430
Or you can just change yours.

108
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.580
Okay.

109
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.600
And the prize is going to be $10, nine, $9.

110
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.390
The quantity is we have five items of this product and four the product name is going to be goosey.

111
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.460
And for you can just say best selling.

112
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.440
Go see.

113
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.010
Gucci clothes.

114
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.760
And click on upload.

115
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:45.070
You can see the fields are valid so we expect it gets printed over the new terminar.

116
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.170
Newton Manor and OC Hotspots.

117
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.800
Okay.

118
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.620
You can see.

119
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.050
And hopefully now you've mastered everything.

120
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.360
You can see the price.

121
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.400
And we said it's going to be a double.

122
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.380
So it has a decimal point or it is always a special decimal point.

123
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.210
And we said the the quantity is going to be on inch.

124
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:18.290
That is a number without the decimal point or without the dots and the test over here and you can see

125
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.810
the the product name and the product description.

126
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.840
Okay, good guys say in the next lecture.
