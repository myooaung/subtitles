00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.960
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.790
Now, what we can do is over here, we can upgrade test, which is just going to say mute audio.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.200
Then at the right side, we can have a swish so that it can easily choose to turn on audio or a ton

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.610
of audio.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.290
Then over you, you're going to also have it says, which is going to say sound or video.

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.670
Then as well as the right side, you're going to have a switch.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.140
So users can choose to turn off video or turn on video.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.680
Okay, now to do this, I need to go back to our V code now over this video screen.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.820
All we just have to do is to add a trailer comma.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.220
But with my explanation, you just saw that boat widget are got of a similar.

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.540
I just said I need to have the test over here and I need to add the switch then as well.

13
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.470
I'm going to need to have it test again.

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
And over here, we're going to need to have a switch so you can see what I just said is going to be

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.750
similar.

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.250
So what we can do is we can create, just watch, fly and be able to what we use it.

17
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.710
Okay.

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.630
Now to do this, I will need to collapse this.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.430
Then I want to create a new fly over.

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.370
The screens then the widgets over this widget directory or folder create a new hi wish.

21
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.300
We are just going to call meet meeting on this call option.

22
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.940
Then the section wishes to that.

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.450
Now we can use control and v to make it this way and we can just go with this widget since nothing is

24
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.140
going to change.

25
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.010
Okay.

26
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.790
As well we can call this width meeting option.

27
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.120
Right?

28
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.870
Okay.

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.670
Then over here we need to alight and use controlled dot in 1840 material to that package.

30
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.160
Now I just want to go with this container.

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.790
Right.

32
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.660
What?

33
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.790
All we just have to do first is we are going to give the height to this container, the height of 60.

34
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.100
Then we can give a color to this.

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.170
The color is going to be the secondary.

36
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.190
Background.

37
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.729
Colo.

38
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.490
Right.

39
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.200
Okay.

40
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.230
Now with what I just explained.

41
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.650
I said over a year ago to have a chest that over here, you're going to have a switch.

42
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.110
So with what I just said, you should be able to know the next widget you're going to use, which should

43
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.780
be what's a real widget?

44
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.380
Because we want our widgets to be displayed horizontally, that is from left to right.

45
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.280
Okay.

46
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.290
So for the container to have a child on the child, it's going to be a rule.

47
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.560
Widgets and this row widgets can take multiple, which as it allows is to address.

48
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.300
The first charge is going to be test.

49
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.800
And I just said they're going to make this reusable.

50
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.100
Right.

51
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.460
So what we can do is over here, we can create a find our rainbow quartz test as this is the test,

52
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.040
it's going to be a detail type of drink.

53
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.780
And over here you're going to need to had our semicolon in.

54
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.460
Over here we need to highlight and use control and dot not to proceed to the constructor class called

55
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.110
meeting option.

56
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.510
Now we can make this required.

57
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.730
Okay.

58
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.510
Great.

59
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.190
Now, over here.

60
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.560
Just pass in the test.

61
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.910
Right.

62
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.310
Then we're going to use our star to.

63
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.740
This is going to be test star.

64
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.290
Right.

65
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.670
Then we're just going to give you a font size of 16.

66
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.710
Look at the Chile cover and now use control and save the control.

67
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.150
Now to make this smaller.

68
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.810
Then go to the video call screen.

69
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.140
Right.

70
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.490
Then they're going to need to use control and be now after this.

71
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.960
Well, they're going to call the meeting.

72
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.190
Oh, sure.

73
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.540
Okay.

74
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.260
Now you can see it's OneSource to pass and the test the test is just going to say reels audio.

75
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.260
Right.

76
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.040
And you just keep trying to ask to go see what you just did.

77
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.860
Okay, great.

78
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.130
Now you can have another first of all, add it to the cover and face this.

79
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.900
And this is just going to say.

80
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.710
So on.

81
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.800
On.

82
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.600
Son of.

83
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.560
Video.

84
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.830
Right.

85
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.270
Okay.

86
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.950
Great.

87
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.980
Now you're going to sit here and I think there is no space right now to give that space.

88
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.110
They're going to need to use a size box.

89
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.040
Size looks ten.

90
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.210
A bit like a height.

91
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.550
It is a height of ten.

92
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.490
We are giving the highlights because we are giving the space vertically.

93
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.110
Okay.

94
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.550
Now, I think this this is too pushed to the right and to the left side.

95
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.520
So what you can do.

96
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.170
You can give celebrities the space.

97
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.670
Now offer them written in.

98
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.740
Right.

99
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.910
We can give this test a pardon.

100
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.350
So over here, we can use control and dot erupt with pardon.

101
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.410
They're going to be given all sides or ten.

102
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.790
That is the left right bottom at every corner.

103
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.840
He's going to push that aside.

104
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.890
Okay, great.

105
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.460
Now over here, we're going to have what's a switch?

106
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.480
Okay.

107
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.620
So it's in the roll, but they need to add it to cover.

108
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.530
And now we can then of a switch.

109
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.870
Okay.

110
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.690
Switch.

111
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.540
Okay.

112
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.330
They can see it.

113
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.140
Wants this to pass.

114
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:58.080
And the value the value has to do with if the audio is either on or off or the video is either on or

115
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.500
off.

116
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.650
So now, since we're going to make this dynamic, what we can as well do is over here you can create

117
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:12.960
a finer since this is a natural for the value is going to be a detail type of of all of those then the

118
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.600
variable name is going to be called is mute.

119
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.310
Is mute.

120
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.940
Okay.

121
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.950
Now you're going to need to pass it on to the constructor and they're going to require this.

122
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.250
Enough to stop it from being required.

123
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.760
All you have to do is to had a question mark over here.

124
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.740
So with this, you don't really need to use this.

125
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.280
We are going to make as required.

126
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.900
So it is going to be.

127
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.890
This dodge is real.

128
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.870
Okay, great.

129
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.870
Now over here for the value is going to be there is news.

130
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.900
Okay.

131
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.320
Now you can see the one change we once was to pass a function.

132
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.530
And we are going to make this function dynamic, right?

133
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.980
So over here, you can also create a definer, which is going to be a function.

134
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.730
Then it's going to be a type of bull.

135
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.990
This is going to be the actual force that they're just going to call this on change.

136
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.210
Right.

137
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.790
Okay.

138
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:26.670
Now as well, we need to pass it on to the constructor and we're going to need to require this required.

139
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.110
And it is going to be this.

140
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.610
This does not change.

141
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.880
I think we are missing this.

142
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.040
And this as well.

143
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.400
Who's going to check what time this.

144
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.540
Okay.

145
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.110
I think.

146
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.760
Okay.

147
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.590
Recorded on.

148
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.560
Unchanged.

149
00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.250
Okay, great.

150
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.280
Now this control necessary this far.

151
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.260
Now we're going to go to the video call screen.

152
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.690
Like I said, once this opposite.

153
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.340
Now what you can easily just do.

154
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.080
You can use control.

155
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.240
And what you're going to see are required.

156
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.600
Arguments is viewed.

157
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.300
Okay.

158
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.890
What's it look like on this crowd?

159
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.880
Argument is change.

160
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.510
Okay, now, for this release, what we can do is over.

161
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.030
Over here, we can as well create a final agreeable card.

162
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.049
There's going to be a type of.

163
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.080
Then it's going to be is.

164
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:41.970
Or do.

165
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.220
Right.

166
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.850
It's going to be is audio.

167
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.520
Then I just want to set this to true.

168
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:58.210
Do for those who suggest a true as the default value and over where you can see.

169
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.240
So we can't just call this is audio muted.

170
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.220
I'm going to set it to two defaults and bool is.

171
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.760
We do.

172
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.040
Richard, as well.

173
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.300
It's going to be quite a true.

174
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.000
Okay.

175
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:18.830
Great.

176
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.740
Okay.

177
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.340
He's gone.

178
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.710
Okay.

179
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.620
Now for this.

180
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.960
They're going to say this is mute.

181
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.470
This is going to be for the audio rights is going to be is audio.

182
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.620
Is audio muted then for this?

183
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:53.190
We also need to use control and dots are required field required argument and use as well as control

184
00:09:53.190 --> 00:10:03.630
and does require it require documents or change rights over here is going to be is the video.

185
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.930
Is video muted?

186
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.700
Okay, great.

187
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.240
Now you can use control necessary and good check what you just did.

188
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.770
Are you going to sit here a year?

189
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.150
Okay, great.

190
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.920
There is a way.

191
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.880
Therefore the now we can't actually switch, right?

192
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.330
Because you have not created a function.

193
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.030
So now what you can do, we can go back to the meeting option.

194
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.170
Right.

195
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.770
The little notion and over the rule.

196
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.220
We can then say when this alignment with us.

197
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.000
This alignment.

198
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.490
With us this element of space.

199
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.700
Between.

200
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.670
Okay.

201
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.000
This question is to save.

202
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.100
I think, you know, this is going to take this year.

203
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.700
Okay.

204
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.300
Great.

205
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.380
Not in this picture.

206
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.310
They're going to make this.

207
00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.630
Switchable.

208
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.130
Okay.

209
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.360
Okay, guys.

210
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.600
See you in the next lecture.
