00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.630
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.170
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.700
Now, this lecture, I'm going to try to create a log in button over here.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.510
Okay?

5
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.640
So I'm going to go back to our basic code to create this log in bottom from scratch.

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.250
So after this test field, I just going to have a container widget.

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.600
Okay.

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.810
First of all, rather than give that what's in a wheat, okay, now I'm going to get the wheat or the

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.290
screen.

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.050
So now to do that, we have to see a media query, dots of context.

11
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.220
Their dogs size then dealt with.

12
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.290
So this is going to give us the width of the screen.

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.040
They want to see -40 characters to lose control and as say that to get a good format.

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.910
Okay.

15
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.940
Dennison Now going to give is the height of the button.

16
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.180
That's how long is going to be the weight is our weight is going to be okay for the eyes.

17
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.040
We can give a height of 50.

18
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.120
Okay.

19
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.420
Now we are going to give the button a call.

20
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.080
All right.

21
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.110
So what you can do, we can have a decoration over here.

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.020
Then this is going to be box declaration.

23
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.250
Okay.

24
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.800
Now for the collar, this is going to create this collar and the cost.

25
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.610
So that, by the way, I can create another variable.

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.350
I just say this is of a little car, this button.

27
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.270
Hello.

28
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.100
He's going to call us.

29
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.940
That's.

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.820
Rich began.

31
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.310
The harder faudrait.

32
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.360
And that was the reason I used this was able to use this where this record's 400.

33
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.990
Okay, I'm going to go back then.

34
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.530
Over here.

35
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.670
What you can see.

36
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.930
You can see a collar.

37
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200
Then the want on bottom.

38
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.500
Color.

39
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.690
Okay, great.

40
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.440
Now I just want these coach unnecessary.

41
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.560
So check this out.

42
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.210
Q control on this issue.

43
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.830
Okay.

44
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.780
I think we also need to separate this as well.

45
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.520
Okay.

46
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.940
Great.

47
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.610
Now we can give this face.

48
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.340
We turn this.

49
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.020
So over here, we are going to give this face vertically, right?

50
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.570
So there's going to be two items here.

51
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.440
Size box.

52
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.160
So icebergs.

53
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.950
All right.

54
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.350
Oh, probably.

55
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.980
Taxi.

56
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.880
Okay.

57
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.330
I'll try to make this right.

58
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.810
Okay.

59
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.640
Now, let's look at as well, though we can give.

60
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.760
With border radios.

61
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.580
So we can give we can see what areas.

62
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.190
The circle of five.

63
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.720
Right now, you can have a child.

64
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.690
The child is going to be a test widget.

65
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.880
Okay.

66
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.860
Now we can see.

67
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.770
Log in.

68
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.270
Okay.

69
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.920
Look, this is going to look right.

70
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.620
So now we can set our sense out.

71
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.010
That says why over here I use our control and dots to on.

72
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.880
Santa is going to center the test we're trying to save.

73
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.020
Go check it out.

74
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.530
Okay.

75
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.240
Now what you can do, we can give is STI is going to be test.

76
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.240
Sigh.

77
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.600
Okay, we can say font.

78
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.950
Size of probably 20.

79
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.520
Then we can also see.

80
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.350
Font weeds.

81
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.960
Fine.

82
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.440
Sweet.

83
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.660
Good Lord.

84
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.350
Okay.

85
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.820
Okay.

86
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.630
Go check it out.

87
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.130
Okay.

88
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.270
Great.

89
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.960
Now what we can do.

90
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.320
We can make this clickable layer up in this container with a button.

91
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.190
And what is going to be a tab is going to be the equal tab.

92
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.690
So now we are up with widgets so we can see.

93
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.690
Think.

94
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.830
Inkwell.

95
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.350
Okay.

96
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.070
The result of this sweet gesture detector.

97
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.100
What is it they acquire is going to be so cool.

98
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.220
You felt like a splash call or something like that.

99
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.780
Okay, we can just put it on top.

100
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.510
Lucky for that.

101
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.710
It is going to leave this empty.

102
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.550
Okay.

103
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.830
Great.

104
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.380
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
