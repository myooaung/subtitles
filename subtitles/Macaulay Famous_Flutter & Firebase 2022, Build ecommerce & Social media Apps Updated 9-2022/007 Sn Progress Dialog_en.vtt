1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.560
So what we can do is we can show a progress dialog to tell the user that, hey, your order is being

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.630
placed in order to do this, we are going to be using a package and for this purpose we have to go to

3
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.530
our browser and then head up to the dev.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:28.770
And over here we are going to search for a package known as S and Progress Dialog S and Progress Dialog.

5
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.930
Okay.

6
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.020
And click on this first link over here, which says As an underscore progress, underscore dialog.

7
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.420
And now we have to copy this code and head back to your voice code and then you have to go straight

8
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.730
to the pulse back to amplify.

9
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.310
And you can see currently I have already had that.

10
00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.300
So you can just have yours and use control and to save or you can just restart your vehicle after I

11
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.690
done it.

12
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.290
Okay.

13
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.610
Now back to the minus screens folder and then the payments screen.

14
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
What we have to do first is to use control and B, to make this wide.

15
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.200
And the next step is we are going to create a function and we are just going to create this function

16
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.730
over here.

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.110
And we can say void and we're going to call this function, show progress.

18
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.500
Okay.

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.280
And within the function, we are going to create a rainbow.

20
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.010
But before then we can just specify.

21
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.780
It is something known as Progress Dialog and we can call this Rainbow Progress dialog is going to be

22
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.770
equal to.

23
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.870
Progress.

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.250
Progress.

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.150
Dialogue.

26
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.220
You can see it automatically parses the context, but you can see above we have nothing like contest.

27
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.590
And the reason this is different is because we are using the stateful widgets.

28
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.610
So automatically the contest is going to be defined within a state for widgets even without having it

29
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.130
above.

30
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.760
Okay, great.

31
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.039
But if this is a stateless widgets, you won't be able to have access to that contest.

32
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.140
So we are only able to have access to this contest because it is a stateful widget.

33
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.190
And now we can call this rainbow called Progress Dialog.

34
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.430
Requires dialogue.

35
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.230
Then it has.

36
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.480
Something on that show.

37
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.360
Basically, we want to show the progress dialog.

38
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.580
It has a property known as mosque, which is basically referring to the lines on how long we can wait.

39
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.330
We can see on the that is is going to load for one, two, three, four, five, six.

40
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.550
So under it and you can see it's asking for the message.

41
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.390
The message we can say order.

42
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.020
We can just use the capital letter for this order.

43
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.300
Listen.

44
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.960
Or you can just say, please wait, or let's just say please wait.

45
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.590
These.

46
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.450
With OC.

47
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.150
Now youth culture and save.

48
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.390
And lastly, we then have to call this function called progress dialogue.

49
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.090
To do this, we have to scroll down.

50
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.010
Scroll down.

51
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.940
Scroll down.

52
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.850
And you can see we have this function called on press.

53
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.970
And before the up before the follow up, we can then call that function call to progress dialog in order

54
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.050
to start loading.

55
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.210
Okay, great.

56
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.440
And really, there is no need of stopping the progress dialog because basically after we upload that

57
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.100
product is going to play the card and it's then going to take us to the customer screen.

58
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.420
So really we not really need to stop that progress dialog.

59
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.150
And let's try this out.

60
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.120
Okay.

61
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.900
Okay.

62
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.890
Click on pay.

63
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.290
Okay.

64
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.450
I think we have to do this again.

65
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.160
I took hard.

66
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.590
And.

67
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.410
Cash on delivery.

68
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.410
Clapham and P.

69
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.680
Please wait.

70
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.250
Okay.

71
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.530
And what we can also do is we send the.

72
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.560
With ten.

73
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.220
This.

74
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.730
It has a property known as barrier color.

75
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.300
This is going to make it look as if we are in a new screen when we are not.

76
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.430
We can say colours dot sign it's controller and save and let's go try it again.

77
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.730
Okay.

78
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.980
We want this to cut this.

79
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.920
And check out.

80
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.220
Okay.

81
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.690
And we can click on Confirm.

82
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.000
And for now, we are going for the cash on delivery.

83
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.420
And click on confirm again and pay.

84
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.010
You can see it some.

85
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.110
That was the work of the BioWare color.

86
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.990
It made it look as if we are in a new screen.

87
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.530
It also has a property known as background color.

88
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.320
We're going to call her, which is going to be that which is going to change out why it's called.

89
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.580
You just see what's in the background to.

90
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.350
I'm just going to show you again.

91
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.300
As you say, we are going to color see colors.

92
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.950
That red.

93
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.430
Okay.

94
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.080
And.

95
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.090
Let's order.

96
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.230
Okay.

97
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.770
We can order this.

98
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.820
And order this.

99
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.800
Okay.

100
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.130
Cut screen and check out.

101
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.580
Okay.

102
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.320
Think I have some slow network.

103
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.300
Hopefully.

104
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.200
Click on Confirm.

105
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.910
Okay.

106
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.490
Catch on.

107
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.270
Delivery.

108
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.750
Confirm and pay.

109
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.620
You can see it now so we can just change that back.

110
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.570
Okay.

111
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.790
It has a lot of properties you can just over.

112
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:36.140
I think it also has the dismissible, the border radius and so many others.

113
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.360
It has the progress BG collar that round the end user.

114
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.200
Right.

115
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.660
You can just explore more by saying this is okay, we can just try this one more time to make sure everything

116
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.250
is working as expected and as well you can get rid of this barrier color.

117
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.260
Remember, this would make it look as if we are in a new screen when we are not.

118
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.710
Right.

119
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.360
Okay, we can just have this.

120
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.990
These are cards and we can just head for the women category.

121
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.060
Okay.

122
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.470
I think I prefer this women gown and have this.

123
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:21.010
And also I'm going to have this Gucci dance and then touch screen and I'm going to click on Check Out.

124
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.910
Okay.

125
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.530
You can see the name of the customer, the phone number and the address, and you can just click on

126
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.190
Confirm.

127
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.820
Okay.

128
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.440
And cash on delivery.

129
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.750
And this is the total payment.

130
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.620
Okay.

131
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.900
Pay some school.

132
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.850
OC OC order has been placed.
