00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.580
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.110
In this lecture, we are going to use the staggered grid view package in order to display our product

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.390
in a very nice manner.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.570
To do this, you have to head up to pop the depth.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.930
And over here, we are going to search for staggered grid view.

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.140
And okay.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.830
And this obviously I got great view further and click on this.

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:40.670
And what we have to do is to copy this code and back to voice code and then your post back yaml file.

10
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.890
And you can secretly have it installed already.

11
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.180
And after having that, you have to click over there in order to get the package.

12
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.830
Okay.

13
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.860
And now back to the mandatory sorry, the gallery directory.

14
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.090
And then the men.

15
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.220
Now what we can do.

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.300
We can use control and B to make this wide.

17
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.850
And instead of returning a list view what we can do, we can just.

18
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.680
Okay.

19
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.890
Just going to take this a bit to the bottom and over here I'm going to alight and comments.

20
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.720
And over here we're going to return a staggered.

21
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.950
Star.

22
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.480
Staggered.

23
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.470
Greed view and dot counts builder.

24
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.270
Counts be.

25
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.980
You can see the asking for the cross axis counts.

26
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.120
That is how many products we want side by side.

27
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.610
That is why many products we want here and many products we want here.

28
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.230
Okay.

29
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.000
For this, we are going to say two.

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.060
That means 2 to 1 product is going to be here and the other is going to be okay.

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.840
And it's also asking for the item bidder.

32
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.340
For the item bidder.

33
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.440
I think you've seen this before.

34
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.260
It's going to take in it's going to take in contest.

35
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.900
Right.

36
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.120
And in dance.

37
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.970
We could also specify it is a type of ends because it is expecting a number.

38
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.150
And for the contest, we could also specify it is a type of beauty contest.

39
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.410
Okay.

40
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.830
And where?

41
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.420
Break this to the next line.

42
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.330
Okay.

43
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.310
And we can just go ahead and specify how many products we want.

44
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690
So to do that, we'd send we're just going to break this as well.

45
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:52.420
Item counts for the item counts is basically referring to how many products we want to display for the

46
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.200
product is going to be based on how many products we have on the cloud faster database.

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.350
That is how many product products we have uploaded so far.

48
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.680
To do that, we have to say snapshot dot.

49
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.190
Data and docs.

50
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.900
And dot lens.

51
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.270
Okay.

52
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.190
This is going to give us how many products we have in the cloud faster database.

53
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.810
Okay.

54
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.600
And for.

55
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.950
I think we also have this property known as 4D.

56
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.440
Now we can just go ahead.

57
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.300
And we return.

58
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.870
We are going to return maybe a container.

59
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.780
So.

60
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.550
Container.

61
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.560
Okay.

62
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.550
Okay for the container.

63
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.750
We can give this a decoration and box decoration.

64
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.700
We're basically doing this and that's how I've access to some additional property.

65
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.370
And we can say colours that white.

66
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.400
And over here we need this.

67
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.660
And also what we could also do is we can give a border radius to this.

68
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.320
We can say border radius and border radius.

69
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:28.780
I think you already know what all these doors don't say killer of maybe 15 and why we need a true newcomer.

70
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.030
Okay.

71
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:38.180
And outside the box decoration, we can then have maybe a child.

72
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.000
The child is going to be a column in order to have access to a lot of widgets which are going to be

73
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.710
displayed vertically.

74
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.500
That is from top to bottom.

75
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.240
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets.

76
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.200
So it has these children.

77
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.890
Okay.

78
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.210
And for the first child, we can just have a container for this again.

79
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.370
A container.

80
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.400
And we're going to use this which you've not seen before, because basically this first container is

81
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.460
going to be for the image that is to display the product image.

82
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.200
So we're going to use this which you've not seen before.

83
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.450
It is known as cones, strings on strings.

84
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.820
And this is on strings.

85
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.790
Okay.

86
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.650
What we are basically saying is we want to give the image a size that will fill the container.

87
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.160
And both constraints, we can then say mean it's.

88
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.360
That is the product made to product image.

89
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.850
Midnight Mass.

90
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.070
I'm sorry to be.

91
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.480
So sorry.

92
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.250
That must mean we can just say mean I 200 and what we could also do, we can then say mass eyes.

93
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.000
They must eat.

94
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.560
We want should be maybe 50.

95
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.680
And if it is not nice, we can just change that later.

96
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.590
Okay.

97
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.340
And now we can then have.

98
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.080
I have a child, which is going to be an image.

99
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.530
Maybe image that network.

100
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.500
Like he's asking for the source.

101
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.110
For the source, we have to say snapshot.

102
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.010
Snapshot.

103
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.290
Dot.

104
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.920
Dieter.

105
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.260
Dot docs.

106
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.950
Right.

107
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.240
And now we have to assess each product we have by the index.

108
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.850
And we have to say.

109
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.770
Well, I think we.

110
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.120
Sorry.

111
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.300
No.

112
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.190
Anymore, but over here, we're going to pass in the.

113
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.320
I think we caught this once.

114
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.560
We caught this.

115
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.760
Okay.

116
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.670
We called it a product image.

117
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.620
Okay.

118
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.980
Product image.

119
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.510
And now you can see why we have multiple images, right?

120
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:16.620
So definitely we want to be able to display all the images in the home screen at same time.

121
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.310
Right.

122
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.240
You can see basically each products can have multiple images for that specif specific product, right?

123
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:32.760
So what we have to do, we have to then say dot sorry over here, we then have to say zero to get the

124
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.380
first item and over here we need a semi.

125
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.990
Sorry, this over there in our check.

126
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.610
I don't really know what's wrong with me.

127
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.480
Okay.

128
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.310
And now we're going to sort out this.

129
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.030
Okay.

130
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.920
For this.

131
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.970
We have this and it's going to take in something known as contest.

132
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.790
And we can just use the higher function for this.

133
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.400
And now we can say staggered.

134
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.860
Stagger the.

135
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.200
I got Thai and we wanted to feed.

136
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.250
And he's asking for the OC.

137
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.760
He's asking for the cross cell count.

138
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.110
And we're just going to say one.

139
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.460
Okay.

140
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.250
I basically just got all this from the documentation over here.

141
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.250
Everything is out there for you online.

142
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.380
You can see.

143
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:26.080
And most of the time you can just read it over here to see what it does and how to use it.

144
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.440
Then you can see the read me.

145
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.049
We have the installing and versions and basically all it does, you can get it from here.

146
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.669
Okay.

147
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.720
And used controller and has now to save.

148
00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.400
Okay.

149
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.540
We just have to wait for this and hopefully we have no errors.

150
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.210
Okay.

151
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.590
Go check it out.

152
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.220
Okay.

153
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.810
Same guilt, right?

154
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.660
You can see we have just three products, right?

155
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.660
I can see we have just three products over two products.

156
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.080
So we have three main images.

157
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.070
Right.

158
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:17.700
And now what we could also do is after the column.

159
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.740
You can see we have this column.

160
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.810
And the reason for this column is we want all our widgets to be displayed vertically.

161
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.390
That is from top to bottom.

162
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.670
And over here we have this container and we're using these constraints to specify the heights, the

163
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.660
mean heights.

164
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.370
So the reason we are using these constraints is so we have access to the mean height and we are saying

165
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:47.170
it's going to be 100 and also the mass height is going to be 250.

166
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.250
Right.

167
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.060
And you can see basically we are using the image, the network.

168
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:58.900
And remember, the snapshot is basically referring to a variable that has access to all our data as

169
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.250
we have over here.

170
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.890
And we are basically saying the data, the docs to assess each document.

171
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.580
Right.

172
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:13.780
And after assessing each document, we are calling the name of the the name of the field.

173
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:21.190
And we are basically assessing just the first images because you can see why we have multiple images,

174
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.790
right.

175
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:27.880
So we just have to assess just this one and you can see why we have the zero, remember, and then start

176
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.720
from zero.

177
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.600
So this is zero, one, two, three, four and so on.

178
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.570
So I basically assess this first image.

179
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.860
Okay.

180
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.650
Sounds good.

181
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:47.600
And after you container within the column how do you turn a corner and we can have a test we just and

182
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.640
for this we can then say snapshot.

183
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.820
Snapshot.

184
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.480
Look what dot.

185
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.910
This is going to be the data and the docs.

186
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.090
Sorry.

187
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.960
The dogs.

188
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.950
And.

189
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.050
And in dance.

190
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.210
And we basically want to assess the product name.

191
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:13.880
Okay.

192
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.770
Product name and overview.

193
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.670
We need a no check and we need this.

194
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.120
Sorry, this is a column and we'll check it out.

195
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.340
Okay.

196
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.960
And one important thing you should notice, you can see we don't have to go to any screen in order to

197
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.500
go back.

198
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.400
In order to refresh that screen, it is basically displaying real time.
