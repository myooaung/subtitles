00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.050
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome in this lecture.

3
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.150
Robin to start designing the video screen.

4
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.180
Okay, so now what we can do is we can get rid of this center widgets and are going to be using something

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.380
known as page view.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.620
View.

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.430
There are the reason for this is we want to be able to see through each video.

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.900
Okay.

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.820
So over the over here, we're going to be using the page view.

10
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.700
And that's due there.

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.540
Okay.

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.850
You can see this page you to you.

13
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.010
There has a property known as item builder.

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200
We simply miss how our video is going to be displayed.

15
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.620
Okay.

16
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.310
Now this takes in the context.

17
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.280
We can as well specify the type that does it type of feud contest.

18
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.650
Most of the time you don't need to.

19
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.700
And we needed to come our way.

20
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.920
And it does it has this intense.

21
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.250
And as well we can specify the type.

22
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.540
It is a type of ID as well.

23
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.069
Most of the time you don't really need it.

24
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.440
Okay.

25
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.300
Now you can have this and this.

26
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.650
Okay, I'll find this and see what we end up doing.

27
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.760
Okay, I think.

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.110
Okay.

29
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.490
Now, what we can do is we are going to be using this stock widget.

30
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.520
And the reason for this stock widget is we want to be able to place widgets on top widgets.

31
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.840
We are going to be placing the love icon, the share icon and the user profile photo on top of the video.

32
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.230
So that's the reason we're going to need to return.

33
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.080
A iStock.

34
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.890
Widgets stuck.

35
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.860
Best reason to do this for.

36
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.140
What's a prediction?

37
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.350
Okay, stuck.

38
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.440
And I think we need to.

39
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.720
We're just going to see.

40
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.650
What I'm missing, I think.

41
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay.

42
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.260
Okay.

43
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.690
Now we can have a train come over here.

44
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.090
It's going to come over here.

45
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.980
So we know where each event's.

46
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.410
Okay.

47
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.009
And as you know, the stock widget has.

48
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.800
The children.

49
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.500
Now, the first child is going to be the video.

50
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.250
Right.

51
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.880
Okay.

52
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.770
So what we can do, we can just add a comment.

53
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.660
We can see play.

54
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.140
Play video.

55
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.830
Later.

56
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.000
We're going to do this later.

57
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.390
Okay.

58
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.210
So now.

59
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.870
We can then have a column widget.

60
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.040
Colon.

61
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.160
Colon.

62
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.180
Colon, colon.

63
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.410
Okay.

64
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.780
And, you know, this column has the children property and the first chart is going to be on this pundit.

65
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.830
On this funded widget.

66
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.580
So the next we are going to be using to take the available space and for the child is going to be a

67
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.510
rule widget.

68
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.210
You're going to see why we are well why we are doing all this.

69
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.580
We can add the true comb over here is concurrent, excessive erosions, and now we can have the children.

70
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.570
Okay?

71
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.350
The first child of the children is going to be a container.

72
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.600
You're going to see all this shove the okay container, and now we can then have a child again, which

73
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.530
is going to be a column.

74
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.110
Yeah.

75
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.800
It's kind of tricky to do this.

76
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.240
Okay.

77
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.300
And now if we can finally have a test, we get.

78
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.290
Tess.

79
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.830
We just.

80
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.680
And this is gonna be for the user name addition and use control necessary.

81
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.770
And as all we can argue that if you're going to sit here now, all we can do is before this is funded,

82
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.760
get we can have a sized sized.

83
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.250
Sized box and I'll give you the space vertically.

84
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.770
So this is the height of Aldridge.

85
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.270
No one says it.

86
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.420
And over here we need to drill and control and to save.

87
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.400
Are you going to see it somewhere yet?

88
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.180
Okay.

89
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.890
Okay, okay.

90
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.920
Okay.

91
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.200
Now, what we need to do is to take this to the bottom.

92
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.400
Okay.

93
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.680
To do that over this column, we can see main axis alignment.

94
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.410
And.

95
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.920
Name us this alignment dots.

96
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.070
God's hand.

97
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.350
You're going to take it to the hand vertically.

98
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.790
Now.

99
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.410
Let's see.

100
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.500
You're going to see it over here.

101
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.540
Look, you can see and we can make sure the tests are going to start from this hatch.

102
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.880
So all we can do is cross us and cross us almost.

103
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.370
Across us is alarming thoughts.

104
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.040
Darts starts.

105
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.430
Okay.

106
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.080
I was already at the start there, so we didn't see any difference.

107
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.640
And as well, we can't just see as is and mean as is.

108
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.760
Main.

109
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.170
US is the main.

110
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.700
That mean hard work use contract excessive.

111
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.180
Okay.

112
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.440
Now go check it out.

113
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.140
Okay.

114
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.120
Not much different.

115
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.680
Okay.

116
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.940
You can sit over here.

117
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.190
Okay.

118
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.750
And what we can do rationally is.

119
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.200
Over this column.

120
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.430
We're just going to leave it like that for now and stages so we can try and test.

121
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.930
This tie.

122
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.540
Right.

123
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.780
And we can say.

124
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.750
Font size.

125
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.830
To be 21 and.

126
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.050
Fonts.

127
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.730
We can change the color.

128
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.270
Okay.

129
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.210
Is there any way we can make sure his white collar starts?

130
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.380
Whites and.

131
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.800
We can change the font with and we can say font we.

132
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.890
Form with the boat and use control necessary and go check it out.

133
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.250
But now I think it's way to push to the left side.

134
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.870
So what we can do, you can see does the need for the consumer.

135
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.970
So we have access to some additional properties.

136
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.120
So yeah, we can highlight and use control dots and wrap weeds adding.

137
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.330
We can give fans for all sides.

138
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.360
Okay.

139
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.300
Okay.

140
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.610
We can just give 15.

141
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.870
Useful kindness to save.

142
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.940
Okay.

143
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.370
And as well we need for the culture.

144
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.330
So what we can do is we can copy this.

145
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.210
And.

146
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.640
Yes, and he's going to say cop.

147
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.860
Caption And you can reduce this font size, but we don't want it to be that big.

148
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.090
We can just exist in.

149
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.930
And.

150
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.880
Okay.

151
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.670
We can just use the wheat, the goodness we can see.

152
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.900
That's W.

153
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.750
400 case containing excessive.

154
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.500
If you can see it over here below.

155
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.430
Look, you can see.

156
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.140
Okay.

157
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.650
Okay.

158
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.580
That's basically it for now.

159
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.910
I'm just.

160
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.280
I just think you're gonna continue from here and in this picture.

161
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.410
Okay, guys, see you in a sec.
