00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lecture, we are going to solve an issue.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.800
Okay, now click on the sign of button.

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.560
You can simply have this loaded spinner, and these fields are not yet filled in.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.020
Okay, now, before we resolve this error, I'm going to show you the reason for this error.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.510
Head up to the London cell screen and we can use control and beta.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.080
Make this right.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.720
Okay.

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.300
You can see over here we created a function called Sign Up.

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.980
Now what is the function?

12
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.150
A function is simply a block of code that gets executed whenever it is called.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.220
You can see why we have.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.000
The function of sorry.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.820
We are simply calling the function of a so whatsoever we have within.

16
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.620
This block.

17
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.910
This block rights whatsoever we have over here is going to get cold.

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.019
But as you can see, we are adding majors on our East Coast are going to be cold before this is going

19
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.040
to get robbed.

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:14.040
The fields must be valid and before this is going to get drawn, the user must have picked an image.

21
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.490
Right.

22
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.090
Okay.

23
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.840
And over here we are basically saying immediately the user clicks on the sign up is going to set this

24
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.490
loading to true.

25
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.250
Right.

26
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.510
It's going to start loading.

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.740
So what we have to do is if the fields are not valid, you can see why we have this.

28
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.390
If the fields are not valid, then we want to return a snack bar which says our fields must not be empty.

29
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.540
So over here we also do need to set state.

30
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.310
Set states.

31
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.530
Said States.

32
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360
Hopefully I get another prediction.

33
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.590
Said State and it's loading.

34
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.770
It's slow and should remain force.

35
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.340
Right?

36
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.940
Loading.

37
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.630
Should we man force?

38
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.900
Okay.

39
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.560
I'm just going to.

40
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.790
Is Lowden.

41
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.340
Is Snowden okay?

42
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.010
And also, if the field's savvy, if the user refuses to pick an image, we also want to set the stage

43
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.040
so that load is going to stick with that force, the case says states.

44
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.050
And it's loading.

45
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.880
So then should women force?

46
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.430
Okay.

47
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.420
Great.

48
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.190
And now it's is true and save.

49
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.400
I'm going to go back to the screen and come back again.

50
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.180
We just have to wait here.

51
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.820
Okay.

52
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.500
And back to the Create Seller's account.

53
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.780
Now click on this.

54
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.150
Look, you can see you can see we do not have that loaded spinner because what we are basically saying,

55
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.590
remember I said a function is simply a block of code that gets code whenever that gets executed, whenever

56
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.350
it is called.

57
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.900
So all these are a block of code which sorry orders are blocks or blocks of all the sub blocks of code

58
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.960
inside this sign of function.

59
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.500
Right.

60
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.360
And over here we are had integers on how each code is going to get executed.

61
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.050
Right.

62
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.050
This code is going to get, as I said, if all those fields are valid and you can see we are having

63
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.300
another if statement to check if the image was actually picked.

64
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.110
Right.

65
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.770
Okay.

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.800
And basically, whenever a user clicks on this, it's going to is going to start creating, it's going

67
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.630
to start loading.

68
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.430
But over here you can see we have the X, the S not x the spot.

69
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.399
And if the fields are not yet valid, we just want to remain at first.

70
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.970
Okay.

71
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.490
Fully understand this.

72
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.510
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
