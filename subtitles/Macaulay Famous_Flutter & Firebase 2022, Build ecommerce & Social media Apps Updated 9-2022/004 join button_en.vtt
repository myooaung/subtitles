00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.870
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.030
Walker, in this lecture, we're going to create the joint button.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.020
Okay not to do this.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm going to go back to our visa code.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.740
Then we're going to go to a video screen.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.990
Then we're going to need to use control and B, in order to make this wide.

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.830
Now over a year, had it really cooler than.

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.910
We're going to have a size box to separate this last this field and then this widget ribbon.

9
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.310
The hat are going to be given the space vertically that is from top to bottom.

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.980
So there's going to be height of pointy.

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.440
Okay.

12
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.600
Now we can then have the joint bottom.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.300
So it's sort of creating the bottom from scratch.

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.510
We can use an inkwell.

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.640
Not to make this clickable.

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.880
The Inquirer has a property known as On Top.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.510
Okay.

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.710
Great.

19
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.060
Now we can then average height, which is going to be a test widget.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.350
And wish is just going to see joy.

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.790
A guided tour of Elizabeth's Auditorium to always give a very good performance.

22
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.020
Okay.

23
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.370
Now go check what you just did.

24
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.900
Okay, great.

25
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.740
Now what you can do, we can give pardon to all the sides.

26
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.910
So we can.

27
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.230
We can use control.

28
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.770
And that's.

29
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.510
Then we can click on wrap with pardon for the sides.

30
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.890
Yes, we can just go with it.

31
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.120
Okay.

32
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.740
I'm trying this to save.

33
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.970
Then make sure you also I just come over now to get a very good format.

34
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.590
Okay, great.

35
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.570
Now, what else we can do is we can increase the test size.

36
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.040
So to do that, we just have to use a CI is going to be test STI.

37
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.820
He's going to be tested, right?

38
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.990
Okay.

39
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.850
Then we can say font size of 16.

40
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.190
Right.

41
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.550
Okay.

42
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.540
Agitation on.

43
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.910
Then go check what you just did.

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.620
Okay.

45
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.650
Great Lakes is not clickable.

46
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.460
Now, what you can also do lastly is we can just create a new function to.

47
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.240
Well, I.

48
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.790
We can create a functional call to join.

49
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.360
Within.

50
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.080
Okay.

51
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.710
Great.

52
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.140
Now I just want to pass.

53
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.920
That.

54
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.290
So for the on top.

55
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.920
We're going to join medicine.

56
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.060
You can get rid of this.

57
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.270
What you can do is we can make this private.

58
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.920
So we are going to be able to assess dysfunction in order for us.

59
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.510
So what you can do by me to make this private, I just use the underscore.

60
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.560
Then I'm going to click on this to go back to where we use this.

61
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.970
We're going to change it to underscore.

62
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.770
Okay, great.

63
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.390
Now is controlling this to save.

64
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.730
And good check it out because it's not clickable.

65
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.270
Or probably we can also see fonts.

66
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.320
For tweets from tweets.

67
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.970
That vote.

68
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.450
Okay, switch on this AC and go check what you just did.

69
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.710
Okay.

70
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.150
Great.

71
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.000
I think it is okay.

72
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.440
Okay.

73
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.460
Okay, guys.

74
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.160
See you in this lecture.
