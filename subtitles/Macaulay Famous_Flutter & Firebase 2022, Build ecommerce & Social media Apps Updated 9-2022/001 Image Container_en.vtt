00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.820
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.880
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.850
In this lecture, we're going to start building the upload product screen.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.370
Okay.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.950
Now, to do this, the first step is to create a new file.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.060
And we are going to create this new file in the views directory.

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.170
Okay, new file.

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.810
And we're going to call this file upload.

9
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.520
On the score products, on the score screen, and then the station is the dot.

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.670
And what we can do, we can use control and B to make this wide and we are going to go with the stateful

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.330
widget.

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.120
And the reason for the stateful widget is because in the future we are going to be able to update the

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:52.610
UI stateful widgets and as well we can call this upload products, then screen and service screen.

14
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.850
And over here we need to alight and use control and dot in order to impart the material to that package.

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.820
And we could get rid of this.

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.170
And in order to have access to a lot of purposes, instead of returning a container, we're going to

17
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.160
return a scaffold with that scaffold.

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.080
Okay.

19
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.190
And as you know, the scaffold has a property like body and for the body is going to be a container

20
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.000
for now.

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.760
And we're going to give this container a color.

22
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.240
A color of blue.

23
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.970
Okay.

24
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.280
And this contract is safe.

25
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.450
And what we have to do is to head back to the cellar on screen and instead of the center with jets,

26
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.610
we could get rid of this and use the upload.

27
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.150
Her blood products.

28
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.200
Upload a product screen.

29
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.540
And over here we need to hold.

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.800
Once we start this, it's going to take some time to restart.

31
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.160
And since I'm just doing it for some time now.

32
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.110
Okay.

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.030
And let's go check this out.

34
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.150
Get us to halt.

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.460
We start this up and we can go check it out now.

36
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.870
You can see the blue screen and we're going to start building this right away.

37
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.500
And back to the screen.

38
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.010
Now what we are going to do is all our widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

39
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.220
That is from top to bottom.

40
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.560
And because of this, we are going to be using a widget known as column to wrap everything up.

41
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.220
Right.

42
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.750
So instead of returning a container, we can get rid of this and we are going to return.

43
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.430
Sorry, we are going to use a column widget.

44
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.560
Now, that's a display widget, vertically, that is from top to bottom.

45
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.570
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets.

46
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.430
So it has these children.

47
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.900
And now the first chart is going to be a row widget.

48
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.490
And the reason for this rule is over here.

49
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.920
We are going to have a container where all our picked image are going to be displayed.

50
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.820
And over here we are going to have the categories and the subcategories section.

51
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.300
So my explanation, you can see we are going to have two main widgets and they are going to be displayed

52
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.000
what horizontally.

53
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.450
So for this purpose we need a row widget.

54
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.220
And as you know, a row can take multiple widgets.

55
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.090
It has these children and now the first child is going to be a container.

56
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.360
It's a container and we can go ahead and give this container a height.

57
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.720
That is how long it's going to be.

58
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.030
And for the height in order to make this more responsive rather than harden a static figure.

59
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.790
Over here we can get the width of the phone screen.

60
00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:03.510
So to do that, we have to say media, media query, dot of contest, dot size and dot height.

61
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.970
And we want zero sorry, zero Soviet times.

62
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.640
If it's zero, that's three.

63
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.150
That is how long it's going to be.

64
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.400
Okay, we need this.

65
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.740
And I think we're missing one additional.

66
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.019
Okay.

67
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.399
All right.

68
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.990
This is what we are missing and just going to do this.

69
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.570
Sorry.

70
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.710
I don't really know what I'm missing.

71
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.330
Okay.

72
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.810
Media.

73
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.560
Media query of contest.

74
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.450
Dot size.

75
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.650
Dot height.

76
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.360
OC times 0.3.

77
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.810
Okay.

78
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.020
And also the wheat that is all white is going to be.

79
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.540
We could also get the width of our screen with that query, that off contest dot size, then dot width,

80
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.610
and this is going to be zero.

81
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.410
So 0 to 5.

82
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.270
Zero times.

83
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.480
Zero dot.

84
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.990
Five.

85
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.290
Okay.

86
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.170
Hydrogen newcomer.

87
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.790
And I think we're missing this.

88
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.860
Okay.

89
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.920
We needed to get rid of that.

90
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.760
And now we can give a color to this container so we could say color.

91
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.070
So in a child color.

92
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.100
And we can just give this a colour of colours, the blue, blue, grey, and we can give this some little

93
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.520
shade of red in this country and save.

94
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.950
And you're going to see it right over here like you can see.

95
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.430
And what we can do in order to get through it, you can see, is overlapping so we can wrap this column

96
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.550
with something known as a save area.

97
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.030
I'll use contouring dots and rap with save save area.

98
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.570
Like he's trying to save and go check this out.

99
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.090
Look, you can see now grades.

100
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.880
And what we could also do is.

101
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.290
We can how they test over a year to do that.

102
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.950
As you know, the container has a property known as child for the child is going to be a test widget.

103
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.460
And we can then say you.

104
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.830
You have.

105
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.060
And the other thing is we can use this backslash.

106
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.980
On RN and Backslash and RN.

107
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:43.690
Then the other test we are hardiness is going to be hard the next line so we can say you have you have

108
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.320
a K, we can just say you have nots then backslash and backslash n to take the next step.

109
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.660
So the next line you have not picked.

110
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.870
Any.

111
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.570
Images.

112
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.720
Okay.

113
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.860
Houthis and is control and safe.

114
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.990
Then you can sit over there and you can see we are basically using the backslash to break the last line

115
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.120
before the backslash to the next line.

116
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.940
So what we can do now is we can alight and use control and also wrap this with the center to be at the

117
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.830
center of the sorry, the center of the container.

118
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.600
You're going to see the here.

119
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.910
And we could also increase the.

120
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.840
The font size by saying test I.

121
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.550
And font size of maybe a thin.

122
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.890
Okay.

123
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.990
Let's just say all seven tenants are okay.

124
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.270
This contained excessive.

125
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.420
Okay.

126
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.160
I think this is very, very cool.

127
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.840
Okay.

128
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.290
Sounds good.

129
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.860
Hopefully you are understanding how everything works.

130
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.280
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
