Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.610
In this lecture, we are going to solve a problem now in the categories screen, you can see we can

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.960
basically select multiple category name and definitely we do not need this type of functionality.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.340
And in order to solve this, we are going to need to go back to our VTS code and before this state we

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.050
are going to need to look over its category name.

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.950
So over here we can create a for loop and we can then say var.

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.530
Elements in on the score.

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.410
I tend.

10
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.910
On this score.

11
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.750
It's an.

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.830
Then over a year.

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.590
We're going to call this element of it.

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.970
You can see this element as a variable that has access to all the items because we are basically running

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.630
a loop over each category and then we have four elements in on the score item.

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.120
Then we basically want to assess the is selected and we're going to set it to force.

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.500
So what we are basically saying, we are saying the other category names which are not selected should

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.880
remain force.

19
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.650
Okay.

20
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.980
All to start this.

21
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.960
And.

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.210
Hopefully you understand what I'm trying to say or you're going to see this in real time.

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.130
Okay.

24
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.030
And.

25
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.360
Back to the category.

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.810
Okay.

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.150
Back to the category.

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.410
And now click on this.

29
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.330
You can see now it is set to true and click on this.

30
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.050
It's going to change.

31
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.760
It's going to change that.

32
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.980
Back to force over here.

33
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.010
Click on this set to click on this.

34
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.720
Okay.

35
00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.680
Now, most of the time, you would want to memorize the codes because one thing is trying to understand

36
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.220
and the other is memorizing the code.

37
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.120
And most of the time it could take you up to two days, five days, three days to master this code or

38
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.290
to memorize it.

39
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.840
Okay.

40
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.370
Hopefully you understand.

41
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.800
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
