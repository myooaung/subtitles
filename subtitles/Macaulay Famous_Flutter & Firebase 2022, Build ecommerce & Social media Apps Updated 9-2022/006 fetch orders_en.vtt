00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.000
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.689
Walker, in this lecture, we're going to finish the others.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.500
Okay, not to do this, we're gonna need to go back to the code.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.970
Okay.

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.120
Now, the first step we're gonna need to take is we're going to create a Phi and regular created Phi

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.200
in this provider directory.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.640
Okay.

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.010
So over this provider directory, we're going to create a new PHI, and we're going to call this PHI

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.640
order.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.810
You can call this order provider, but since we are already in the provider directory, definitely we

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.150
know this is a provider phi.

12
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.540
Okay.

13
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.120
So we can just go ahead and say Dot, dot.

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.470
Okay.

15
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.080
Now over here, what we are simply doing as we are fetching the products data.

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.440
Right.

17
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.830
Okay.

18
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.600
So now we want to fetch the orders data.

19
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.030
Right.

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
So definitely is going to be similar with this.

21
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.330
So what we can simply do is we can just copy everything we have over here.

22
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.210
We can just copy from here.

23
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.620
Okay.

24
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.080
Is contra and C and then.

25
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.150
Okay.

26
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.810
Order!

27
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.090
Okay.

28
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.630
We need to go to the orders.

29
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.140
The doubt.

30
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.870
And you're going to need to pace this.

31
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.350
Okay.

32
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.420
And definitely we're going to have some errors.

33
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.840
So what we're going to do is instead of this production model, this is going to be the order model,

34
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.410
right?

35
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.460
Order attributes.

36
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.940
Okay.

37
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.570
Okay.

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.730
And we need to import this.

39
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.870
Right.

40
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.960
In parts.

41
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.240
And is it a paradox?

42
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.250
This is going to be ordered, right?

43
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.070
Or whatever you call it, your collection.

44
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.580
Let's call we called orders.

45
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.960
Okay.

46
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.080
Orders.

47
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.600
Okay.

48
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.650
Right.

49
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.310
I think we also need to import this.

50
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.150
Okay.

51
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.620
Now instead of this.

52
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.290
This is just to get rid of this.

53
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.870
Right.

54
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.790
And this is going to be the order.

55
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.080
How true.

56
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.470
But.

57
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.860
Okay.

58
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.509
Great.

59
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.600
And I'll bring this to see what we're missing.

60
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.250
And I think.

61
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.020
Okay.

62
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.700
Over.

63
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.190
Okay.

64
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.580
Great.

65
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.770
Okay.

66
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.920
Now, one more thing, as I think we are also missing this and the paradox.

67
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.770
We are missing this away.

68
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.910
Now, if you've forgotten what this doors you can't is it just go back to the lecture because definitely

69
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.320
you're going to forget that you're going to forget most of the teens, but most of the time you have

70
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.840
to try to go back to me.

71
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.010
It's okay.

72
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.440
So we need to copy this and.

73
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.800
We can just paste this after you.

74
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.780
Okay.

75
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.770
This is going to be the it's going to call.

76
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.490
You can also take it to the Dow.

77
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.040
Any you can take it to the bottom anywhere.

78
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.360
Okay, great.

79
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.850
And we're going to call this.

80
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.330
Orders writes.

81
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.910
And this is going to be others.

82
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.860
No longer products and.

83
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.070
As well over here.

84
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.300
It is going to be harder.

85
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.260
Okay.

86
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.980
Okay.

87
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.580
Okay.

88
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.220
And.

89
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.620
This is going to be short orders.

90
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.960
Now, I know you must have forgotten where you can.

91
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.870
Just go back to the lecture to see why we did all this.

92
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.280
Okay.

93
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.080
And we can call.

94
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.900
This gets order.

95
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.380
Orders.

96
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.730
Okay.

97
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.120
I think we also need two parts.

98
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.620
Okay.

99
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.510
In part, it's from me.

100
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.450
My theory of the death.

101
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.780
Okay, now we're going to fill in all this fields.

102
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.230
So what we can do is we can break it down.

103
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.250
Okay.

104
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.850
This.

105
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.320
This.

106
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.820
Okay.

107
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.990
This.

108
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.610
And this.

109
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.190
This AK and.

110
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.850
This.

111
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.190
Right.

112
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.570
Okay.

113
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.540
Now, over here, we are going to use this which you have seen before, elements.

114
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.580
And they meant that's where it gets their field.

115
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.520
Make sure the field is the same scene as what you have over here as you're going to get what's in bad

116
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.880
states.

117
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.370
So you can easily just copy what I think it is same as what we have over here.

118
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.700
So what we can do is we can essentially just copy this.

119
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.730
And his.

120
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.650
As well we can men's.

121
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.390
The word dart gets.

122
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.040
And.

123
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.930
Her that.

124
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.760
I'd.

125
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.730
And they meant.

126
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.160
Don't get is going to be words.

127
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.480
The tie to.

128
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.560
And.

129
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.000
And man's.

130
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.530
And the man's dirt gets, there's going to be price.

131
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.540
And we can start to string.

132
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.970
We can make sure we are called Watson.

133
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.310
It's a string and no longer a number.

134
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.570
Okay.

135
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.970
And there's going to be elements.

136
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.830
Dirt gets and there's going to be image.

137
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.230
You are real.

138
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.550
And.

139
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.030
Element.

140
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.380
And the man's and the man gets.

141
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.530
And this is going to be worse.

142
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.470
I'm just going to copy this so I don't make any mistakes, so I don't get busted here.

143
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.920
Okay.

144
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.670
And as well.

145
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.590
And they made.

146
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:10.310
And the minute that gets and you can also copy this book because most of the time I will I will see.

147
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.980
Or that the author is sort of or the dates.

148
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.660
Okay.

149
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.260
Well, yeah, we are having that.

150
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.770
Okay.

151
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.340
I think we forgot this as well.

152
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.100
Elements.

153
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.410
That gets so high.

154
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.880
That gets.

155
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.540
This is going to be art or the idea.

156
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.510
And I think we need to create a climate in this country in this.

157
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.820
Okay.

158
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.870
We have an era of like this and see, okay, I think we need an addition.

159
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.150
Okay, great.

160
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.620
So what we are simply doing over here, we are simply running a loop to look over each document we have.

161
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.800
And for now, we just asked Siri documents.

162
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.130
Right.

163
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:04.030
And I told you, each document is deferred to something known as what's documents, not snapshots.

164
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.920
And all the documents put together is refer to something known as what?

165
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.360
Career snapshots.

166
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.950
So you can see that was why we have to specify the type of variable.

167
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.580
So you can say, okay, so I think we also need to, we never do is to order snapshots and.

168
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.110
Or the snub shark.

169
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.530
Okay.

170
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.270
Just control necessary now.

171
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.440
Okay.

172
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:37.980
So all this data, all these documents are referred to as query snapshots, but each document is referred

173
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.980
to as document snapshots.

174
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.110
So since we are running a loop now, we have access towards each document.

175
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.750
So you can see this type of variable where it is words, document, snapshot.

176
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.170
Right.

177
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.590
Okay.

178
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.170
So what I simply saying is all this data, all this document puts, all this document puts together

179
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.690
are known as words, query snapshots.

180
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.040
But each document is known as document snapshots.

181
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:12.000
So if you have just a document is going to be words, document, snapshot.

182
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.120
And if you are fetching all the documents currently, that's what we are doing.

183
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.600
So it's going to be known as word query snapshot.

184
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:26.970
But over here we are simply running to look over a document and then gets the use, the holder I.D.,

185
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.530
the user ID, and so hard.

186
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.600
Now, if you've forgotten what this does, you can easily just go back to the lecture where we did all

187
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.900
this in order for you to re understand, because most of the time you're going to forget everything

188
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.260
I know.

189
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.059
So that's all you have towards this lecture.

190
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:48.510
So times three times to five times, in order for you to grab all the process again and again and enough

191
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.220
for you to be able to code it.

192
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:50.970
Okay.

193
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.510
Okay.

194
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.570
This is all right.

195
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.340
This is it for this lecture.

196
00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.530
So what we simply did was to fetch the orders from the cloud first.

197
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.220
Okay.

198
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.300
Okay, guys.

199
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.550
See you in the next lecture.
