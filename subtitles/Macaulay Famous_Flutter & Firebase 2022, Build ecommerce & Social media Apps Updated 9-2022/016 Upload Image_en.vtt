00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.010
In this lecture, we are going to be able to upload the product images.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.650
Okay.

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.930
Now to do this, we are going to do this right after this statement where we are basically saying if

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:25.500
image this dot is not empty, if image Liz dot is not empty, then we want to upload the product images.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.030
But before then, definitely we might have errors.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.210
So what we have to do is to use a try and a catch block to catch those errors.

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.940
Okay.

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.370
And you can see over here we are going to be able to pick multiple images, right?

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.410
So what we have to do first is to look over each peak image and then upload them to do that.

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.930
Within the try, we have to create a follow and for follow.

13
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:09.470
And we can then say for the image and the image list because all of our uploaded sorry, all of our

14
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.880
picked image is going to be stored in this variable called images.

15
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.560
So we are basically saying for each image in the image list over here, we also need to say it can be

16
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.010
no.

17
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.560
Then we want to upload it to the Firebase Storage.

18
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.030
Right.

19
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.590
Okay.

20
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.810
To do that, we have to import that Firebase Storage and I think we already installed that.

21
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.240
So while we can say finer and it is a type of firebase.

22
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.800
Firebase.

23
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.350
Five is courage and we can call this variable on this score.

24
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.880
Firebase Storage is going to be equal to Firebase.

25
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.440
Firebase Storage instance.

26
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.120
Okay.

27
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.140
And.

28
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.340
And where are you?

29
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.120
And okay, over here.

30
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:15.560
If it is not empty, we basically want to look over images and now we want to call the Firebase Storage

31
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.170
and Dot RAF.

32
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:28.460
And the first step is to is to create a folder where all the pics image so we have all the uploaded

33
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.500
images are going to be stored.

34
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.280
Right.

35
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.260
So we can basically just say RAF then dot child and this first child is basically referring to the name

36
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.720
of the folder and the second child is basically referring to the name of the file.

37
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.770
But what we can just do to make our code more cleaner or more easier to read, we can just get rid of

38
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.370
this.

39
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.680
And within the RAF we can then say Product that's this.

40
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.530
We want all our uploaded images to be stored in a directory called products.

41
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.710
Like you can see this is a bit different from the way we did for uploading the customers profiles,

42
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.070
right?

43
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.940
We basically just said RAF and tried again and I think this is very long and instead of following this

44
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:29.030
long quotes, you can just say dot RAF and we have to specify the name of the directory where all our

45
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.960
images are going to be stored and we can call this product.

46
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.440
And what we basically just have to do is to have a backslash slash.

47
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.570
You can see we are basically avoiding that second child again and added backslash.

48
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.610
And this backslash is basically referring to the name of the file.

49
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.250
And what we can do is we can generate a unique file, a unique file name for every images that are going

50
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.270
to be uploaded.

51
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.450
To do that, we are going to import a package.

52
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.820
Okay.

53
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.350
Over here, we are going to import the parts package.

54
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.269
This will help us generate a unique path for each uploaded image, which is going to serve as the name

55
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.200
of the file.

56
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.910
Okay.

57
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.630
Path.

58
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.040
Hopefully I get that in part.

59
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.960
And pot's okay.

60
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.500
This is.

61
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.820
Okay.

62
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.200
And this is it over here.

63
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.870
And what we can do is we can rename this.

64
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.910
We can see as part.

65
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.590
Okay.

66
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.530
And now that sausage is a available we have to have this and a dollar sign and now we have to say pats

67
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.850
dot base name and get rid of this.

68
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.920
Okay.

69
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.670
And now we can store the results in a variable called ref.

70
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.000
And this is a type of reference.

71
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:09.730
Three fairies are your equal to that and it's going to take some time to upload.

72
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.860
And definitely we have to wait and that's easier.

73
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.300
Wait.

74
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.390
We have to use the async or via.

75
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.140
And now we can then say, how is this review?

76
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.770
Rev.

77
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.540
What does poots?

78
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.790
Dodds puts this is going to be put five.

79
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.510
And.

80
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.160
There's going to be this image, right?

81
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.980
Because we are we're basically saying for each image, you can see this as a variable that has access

82
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.810
to each image which is going to be stored over this list.

83
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.170
Okay.

84
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.580
Hopefully you understand this.

85
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.460
Okay.

86
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.530
And we have to get the part of the image.

87
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.250
Right.

88
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.670
Okay.

89
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.130
That is basically the path to the image.

90
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.690
Okay.

91
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.320
And we have this error that's put.

92
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.870
Five.

93
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.280
Okay.

94
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.910
Sorry.

95
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.440
So for Dad, we have to say five first.

96
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.640
I think you've seen this before.

97
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.320
Five.

98
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.650
Okay.

99
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.590
And image.

100
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.040
Diane Dodds.

101
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.510
What parts?

102
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.410
Okay, you.

103
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.330
Great.

104
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.780
Add your semicolon or we can just go for the we can say dot when complete.

105
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.300
When complete.

106
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.090
What we want to do again is use this link because.

107
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.570
Sorry.

108
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.590
Okay.

109
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.410
And how do your semi-colon.

110
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.630
And Greg this and we are going to have it.

111
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.490
So we have to use the Synclavier.

112
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.400
Okay.

113
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.070
And we have to say our wait and then ref.

114
00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.520
Rev xref ref ref dot gets downloads url to get the uploaded images.

115
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.060
Okay.

116
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:11.020
And now what we also want to do is to store that uploaded images in a variable.

117
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.020
To do that, we have to create a list.

118
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.670
Okay.

119
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.270
And I'm going to create this right where we have that.

120
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.180
Okay.

121
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.950
All screw up.

122
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.170
Okay.

123
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.400
I'm just going to create this right after this.

124
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.070
So we expect in the list of images.

125
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.540
So this is going to be list.

126
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.150
And basically images are strings, right?

127
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:52.100
And we can call this image u our hell list and we can make it easy for now image you URL list and basically

128
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.070
we are not making it no label by having this.

129
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.640
You can see we are not making it more knowledgeable.

130
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.270
Okay.

131
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:09.390
And back to where we have that in Nevada, we can then say dots when.

132
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.740
That's okay.

133
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.410
We can just use the dots.

134
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.200
Dots, then.

135
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.390
But then.

136
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.380
Sorry.

137
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.220
Not other then.

138
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.270
But then.

139
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.710
And the value.

140
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.340
Okay.

141
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:36.909
And now we have to say image this image you are least than God's had and value the values, basically

142
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.640
referring to the uploaded images.

143
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.970
And this is basically all we need.

144
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.630
And for the tribe, we can.

145
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.300
Maybe return a snack bar.

146
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.020
Or we can just for now print he to tell the error.

147
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.420
And I think this is basically it.

148
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.270
Okay.

149
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:07.550
What we are basically doing is we have definitely we might have some errors.

150
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.470
And what we have to do is to use the try and catch block to catch any errors.

151
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.350
And within the try you can see we are able to pick multiple images.

152
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.170
So what we have to do is to look over each image.

153
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:28.340
Each image is is a loop over each images we have in the image list.

154
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.030
Right.

155
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.190
And what we are basically doing is to.

156
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.780
Create a folder where the images is going to be stored.

157
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:44.730
And we created a default code of products and we had the backslash to tell the name of the file.

158
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.860
That is the image name.

159
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.880
Right.

160
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.410
Okay.

161
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:55.290
And over here we are using the await to put the file that is the basically depict image, right.

162
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.960
Because over here we are basically looking over each peak images we have in this image.

163
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.060
Right.

164
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:11.700
And now we are putting the file over here and we are basically saying once this complete, what we want

165
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:20.910
to do is to get the diluted URL and after after getting the download URL, we want to store all the

166
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.800
images.

167
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:29.820
Sorry, we want to store all the images in a variable called image hell list.

168
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.640
And you can see we are basically saying go hard and value so hard all the images.

169
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.260
Okay, hopefully you understand this and you can see this.

170
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.080
Sorry, you can see this is a bit similar to what we have.

171
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.760
Okay.

172
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:49.290
Okay.

173
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.920
You can see this is a bit similar to what we have over over a year.

174
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.070
Over a year.

175
00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.940
Okay.

176
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.860
Yeah, sorry.

177
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.700
Yeah, but over here, we said the child.

178
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:10.850
The child, remember, the first child is basically referring to the name of the father and the second

179
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.490
child is basically referring to the image file.

180
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.830
But instead of doing that, we basically just passed it over and added backslash.

181
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.240
Okay.

182
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:25.160
I think anyone you think is more cleaner, you just have to go with it and anyone you take is more convenient

183
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.880
for you.

184
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.720
You just have to stick with that.

185
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.360
Okay.

186
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.230
And I'll just try this out.

187
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.290
I already have picked some images and.

188
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.670
This is, man.

189
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.010
Okay.

190
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.280
This does not really matter.

191
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.780
For now, we are basically just uploading the images.

192
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.320
And for the price, I can say maybe.

193
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.410
Okay.

194
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.240
I think.

195
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:58.820
You have to wait for five is okay or 50 for the quantity seven.

196
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.580
And I'm just going to type something gibberish over and something gibberish.

197
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.230
Over there.

198
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.860
And click on upload.

199
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.120
Okay.

200
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.890
Please select a subcategory.

201
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.760
You can see and shed click on upload.

202
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.460
Okay.

203
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.380
No errors.

204
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.150
Let's go check out seminar.

205
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.250
Hopefully something is going on there.

206
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.650
And Kay.

207
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.480
Okay.

208
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.860
Something's going on there.

209
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.710
Hopefully I have a network connection.

210
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.880
Okay, I'm just going to open this in a new tab.

211
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:46.330
Okay, wait for this and hopefully we have that new folder called Products.

212
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.230
Waits for this.

213
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.670
Okay.

214
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.800
Okay.

215
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:58.220
Since we have this products and you can see.

216
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.130
There is an issue.

217
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.200
There is an issue.

218
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.300
There is a problem we have.

219
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.340
We're going to solve this now.

220
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:13.980
Okay.

221
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.360
And this is coming from Aiken saying we have just one uploaded image.

222
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.830
Okay.

223
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.620
That should be coming from the pot.

224
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.480
Okay, upload.

225
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.820
Upload.

226
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.890
Get rid of this.

227
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.460
And over here, we said.

228
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:39.860
Okay.

229
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.700
Sorry.

230
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.100
Sorry.

231
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.050
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

232
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:50.260
Just trying to make this slide, and I'm just going to do this again to the spot.

233
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.550
So does a baby's name.

234
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.210
Right.

235
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.020
This name.

236
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.400
I think you just have to.

237
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.750
And we're going to pass the image part.

238
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.520
That part.

239
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.140
Okay, great.

240
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.880
And we said the name of the folder is going to be called.

241
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.340
It's going to be called sorry.

242
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.600
The name of the folder is going to be called Products and the name of the file.

243
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:27.870
We basically want to generate a unique URL and also we want to use the name of the image that is the

244
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.160
part of the image.

245
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:37.490
And also we basically want to concatenate the a unique part and the name of the the parts to the image.

246
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.790
Hopefully you understand this.

247
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.820
This is a bit confusing.

248
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.960
Okay.

249
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.820
Hopefully you understand what I'm trying to say.

250
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.760
And what we can just do is to.

251
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.300
Maybe just upload again.

252
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.220
Okay.

253
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.290
Storage.

254
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.180
Okay.

255
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.480
And see if I can maybe delete.

256
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.120
Okay.

257
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.460
I'm just going to try to see if I can delete this.

258
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.290
Okay.

259
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.860
I don't know where to delete.

260
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.590
Okay.

261
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:21.130
In this case, we have to mark and delete.

262
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.220
Okay.

263
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.640
And now let's try this out again.

264
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.600
We're just going to go back to phys.

265
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.700
Okay.

266
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.010
And we do not have that anymore.

267
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.150
And click on.

268
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.480
Okay, we basically just reset everything again.

269
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:41.450
Okay.

270
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.540
We just have to do that.

271
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.480
Okay.

272
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.130
Take this.

273
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.520
Okay.

274
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.340
So let.

275
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.040
And we have to select.

276
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.770
Okay.

277
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.510
Or can just go with that category.

278
00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.760
And five.

279
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.090
Two.

280
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.950
This does not matter at this point.

281
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.150
And.

282
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.650
Okay.

283
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.500
Upload.

284
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.510
Okay.

285
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:12.930
Go check.

286
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.790
Tell me not to see what is going on there.

287
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.990
Okay.

288
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.650
And we can just head to this and go back.

289
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.380
Okay.

290
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.860
You can see we have this paradox.

291
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:29.570
Okay.

292
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.440
Okay.

293
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.180
Sounds good.

294
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.450
And now we have the parts.

295
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.740
And also we have the image you can see over here.

296
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.600
We have this jpg.

297
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.520
This name is coming from the part.

298
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:46.710
It's coming.

299
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.810
It's coming from the part of the image that is the source on how we uploaded it.

300
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.100
And this overlay is coming from the parts.

301
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:03.150
So this is coming from the image parts and this is coming from that parts package we installed.

302
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.780
So by doing this, all our images are going to be unique.

303
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.190
Else if it is not unique, it will basically just replace them.

304
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.099
Just like you already have a video before.

305
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:21.750
And you are you are putting all that video in that same directory with the same name.

306
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.040
What it will basically do is what it will overwrite it.

307
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:30.450
So that's why we have to create this unique path name for each image.

308
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.930
You can see all the files, have a unique name.
