WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.280
We are going to continue from where we stopped.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:02.920
Okay.

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.100
Now, instead of returning at least view, we can get rid of all this.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.490
It ends over here and we are then going to return a scaffold scaffold.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
And as you know, the scaffold has a property known as Arbor.

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.690
Bah.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.160
And I think we need that already.

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.160
Use control and save.

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.180
Okay.

10
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.720
Okay.

11
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.470
Okay.

12
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.530
And now we can get rid of the elevation by saying elevation zero.

13
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.880
And also, we can change the background color.

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.840
This is going to be close that.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.010
White Oak and.

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.370
We also do have to change the back arrow to color black.

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.780
So we tend to harbor it as a property known as I contain this.

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.620
This is going to be icon team then data.

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.030
Okay.

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.780
And then we can pass the color.

21
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.180
This is going to be colors the black.

22
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.560
Okay.

23
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.760
And also within the harbor.

24
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.590
It has.

25
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.460
It has a property known as Title and.

26
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.110
There's going to be a test widget and it can say customer.

27
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.160
Well there.

28
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.220
Okay.

29
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.080
Oh, the default is going to be white so we can change the color.

30
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.290
Test, I.

31
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.690
Color colors that black.

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.890
Okay.

33
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.340
So.

34
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.130
Okay.

35
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.950
All right.

36
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.230
This is what you're missing.

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.990
Okay.

38
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.600
An additional parenthesis.

39
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.420
Okay.

40
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.540
And also we can set the center title to true.

41
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.620
Okay.

42
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.729
Check this out.

43
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870
You should sit at the center.

44
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.540
Okay.

45
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.570
Or maybe we can just get rid of this.

46
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.290
I think it was okay that way.

47
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.700
And this.

48
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.500
And that's why I'm very cool from it.

49
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.190
Okay.

50
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.300
And now within the scaffold, it has a property known as body.

51
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.470
And the body is going to be list view.

52
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.500
This view.

53
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.820
This sheet of either the computer is always going to take in the contest and the intense.

54
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.660
And now we can return something known as as passion.

55
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.820
As passion.

56
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.150
Hopefully I can spell this as passion.

57
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.440
Ty.

58
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.430
Okay, great.

59
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.750
Now the special tie has a property known as title for the title.

60
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.210
We're just going to use a rope, because basically we want to display our widgets horizontally.

61
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.710
Okay.

62
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.570
Great.

63
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.700
And before the return we can create a variable to store all the data.

64
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.670
We have a way to do this before the return.

65
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.460
We can call this variable order.

66
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.860
It's going to be equal to snapshot.

67
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:39.810
Snapshot your data then do docs and we basically want to assess each by the index and we need a no check

68
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.350
over.

69
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.160
Sims could.

70
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.570
Over this, you see.

71
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.960
What we are missing.

72
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.770
Okay.

73
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.310
Sorry.

74
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.640
This should be our order.

75
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.240
Okay.

76
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.530
And also we need to get how many orders we have in our database.

77
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.590
So to do that, we have to say.

78
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.360
I think counts.

79
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.040
This is going to be snapshot.

80
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.060
The data that docs then the length and the why we need that as well.

81
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.620
OC use control.

82
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.970
And as to save.

83
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.690
And what we can then do is we can display the product, the ordered product's image.

84
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.060
We can then have children.

85
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.250
We can just have the train come out via.

86
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.970
And obey as well and use control necessary.

87
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.500
Okay.

88
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.950
And now we can advertise box because basically we want to give this image a height, any width size

89
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.880
box.

90
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.920
And we can then give this idea of maybe hundred.

91
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.590
And also a tweet, a tweet of Andrade.

92
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.890
I think we need to.

93
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.570
Get rid of this.

94
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.840
Okay, Cisco.

95
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.480
Then within the sandbox, we can then have the child.

96
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.740
The child is going to be image that.

97
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.610
Network.

98
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.340
And it's going to be the order.

99
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.470
So with a court order.

100
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.280
And basically, I think we have a field known as order image.

101
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.770
But the image now really no need of saying we need the first item because basically independent screen.

102
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.100
Independent screen.

103
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.750
In the main screen.

104
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.560
Where do we have that?

105
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.750
You can see over here, we are already seeing the first and it was only the first image that got uploaded.

106
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.910
So you can see it is not a list of images.

107
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.350
Okay.

108
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.560
Now back to the customer or the screen.

109
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.560
And we can then use control and save and Novaya we can also have a semicolon.

110
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.850
And go check this out.

111
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.490
Okay.

112
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.220
Sounds cool.

113
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.910
And also over here, we can display the name of the product.

114
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.290
What I think within the screen, we do not have any field known as product name.

115
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.930
Right?

116
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.350
So what we can just do is before the order image, we can create another field.

117
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.660
And we are going to call this order name, which is basically going to be the product name, and we

118
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.970
can then call the item.

119
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.450
I can then dot products.

120
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.600
I think we have.

121
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.520
The product name.

122
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.750
My pain.

123
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.990
Okay.

124
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.230
We call that name.

125
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.890
Okay.

126
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.010
And we need this, okay?

127
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.340
This country needs to save.

128
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.230
And what we have to do now is to delete this collection, because you can see we do not have that product

129
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.240
name of or the name of the product.

130
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.220
So we have to delete this in order to create a new set of order, which is going to have that product

131
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.700
name.

132
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.870
The lead collection and orders.

133
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.770
They need.

134
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:25.470
Okay.

135
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.640
And now we have to order for a new product.

136
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.550
This.

137
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.860
I took it.

138
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.920
And you can just order one more.

139
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.890
Maybe this.

140
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.840
And maybe.

141
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.020
One more.

142
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.000
From the electronics and this.

143
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.420
And.

144
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.570
Check out.

145
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.280
Okay.

146
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.690
And confirm.

147
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.860
Cash on delivery.

148
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.410
Kofi Annan.

149
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.990
Pay.

150
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.590
Okay.

151
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.650
I think it's done.

152
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.890
We can go to the screen and come back to it.

153
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.310
Others.

154
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.020
And we can go to the profile.

155
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.340
Order.

156
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.650
Okay.

157
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.680
I think we hold that for two products.

158
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.310
I think what we all done for the product, but we have just one.

159
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.200
We can just do this again.

160
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.850
Back and.

161
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.230
Okay.

162
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:39.980
This.

163
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.030
And.

164
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.120
Check out.

165
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.670
Confirm.

166
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.460
Go.

167
00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.980
Okay.

168
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.620
And we can just go on for now.

169
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.890
Okay.

170
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.460
Order.

171
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.130
You can see we have the the other image and now we have the order name.

172
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.910
I think so.

173
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.290
What a name.

174
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.600
You can say the name of the product.

175
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.150
Okay.

176
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.050
Now back to the customer order.

177
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.130
Within the rule we can then have.

178
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.300
A column, because under of this, we want to have the.

179
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.850
The we want to have another test.

180
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.920
Okay, so now we can add the children and test.

181
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.290
This is going to be order.

182
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.140
Further.

183
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.380
Then order name.

184
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.450
Okay.

185
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.650
So.

186
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.400
In this country save.

187
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.590
And you should see the way.

188
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.110
Okay.

189
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.780
And we can start this.

190
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.800
So.

191
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.460
Stay.

192
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.070
Test STI.

193
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.500
Okay.

194
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:09.160
We can give this a font size of maybe a thin.

195
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.360
Okay.

196
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.390
And most of the time you might have a very long product name.

197
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:29.970
So what we can do is we can wrap this column with something known as flexible widget in order for that

198
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:37.470
long test, that long product name, in case you have that to to make it take the available space or

199
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.570
make it responsive.

200
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.580
Okay.

201
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.380
And also within the test, it has a property known as overflow.

202
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.000
Over flow and you can say overflow.

203
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.220
Over.

204
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.910
I think it's called test overflow that.

205
00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.760
What does we do?

206
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.850
If we have a very long product name, it's going to make it go to the next line.

207
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.170
To fully do that, we also do have to set the mass.

208
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.190
The mass I think mass lies.

209
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.830
So maybe to.

210
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.380
Okay.

211
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.350
What we said is now sorry, not what we said, but safe.

212
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.600
Now you won't be able to see this now because we have a very short product name.

213
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.020
Right.

214
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.430
You can see what that was.

215
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.830
One of the reasons we have to use the expansion tab.

216
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.060
So when we click on this, we are then going to see the full.

217
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.750
Details of that.

218
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.400
Products.

219
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.980
Okay.

220
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.620
Sounds good.

221
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.510
Working as expected.

222
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:43.560
Okay.

223
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.130
For right now.

224
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.180
I think we are good to go.

225
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.130
Okay, guys, say it in this lecture.
