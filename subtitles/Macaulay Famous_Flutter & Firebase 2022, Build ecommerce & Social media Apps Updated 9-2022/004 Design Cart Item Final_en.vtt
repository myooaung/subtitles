00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.840
In this lecture, we are going to continue from where we start.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.440
Okay?

5
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.220
Now what we are going to be doing in this lecture is over here.

6
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.300
We are going to have the price of the product and over here we are going to have the decrement icon.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.250
And over here that is in the middle, we are going to have the quantity and over here we are then going

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.170
to have the increment icon.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.730
Okay.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.080
Now to do this, we turn the colon right over here.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.100
Now with what I just explained, you can see this widgets are going to be displayed horizontally, that

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.380
is from left to right.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.700
So for this purpose, we are going to be using a row, widgets row with that.

14
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.890
And a rule can take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed what's horizontally?

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.060
And the first side of the row is going to be a test widget.

16
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.710
And this is going to be called.

17
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.760
Provider.

18
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.480
Card provider and dot get items and we want to assess each item by the index that is 012, three, four,

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.750
five.

20
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.940
And this is going to be.

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.530
Dots what dot dot price?

22
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.180
And since it is a double, we have to convert this to string and think we need a comma there.

23
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.770
Use control needs to save.

24
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.510
And go check this out.

25
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.270
Okay.

26
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
You can see the view and within the column which at.

27
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.540
We can then say cross assist alignment.

28
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.060
Remember the cross axis alignment is going to work opposite for the column.

29
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.530
Right?

30
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.350
So this is going to be cross axis alignment dot, dot, dot stuff.

31
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.070
Okay.

32
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.220
Back to where it was before.

33
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.730
And what we can also do is the column has a property known as main access alignment.

34
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.090
I think you've seen this before.

35
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.700
This is going to be main assess alignment.

36
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.590
And remember, this is going to work opposite for the raw widgets, main assets alignment or what we

37
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.630
can say maybe space able to have equal space.

38
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.050
And let's go check it out.

39
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.720
Okay.

40
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.130
I think this is okay.

41
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.880
And over here we can then tie this.

42
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.460
Style.

43
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.830
Sorry.

44
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.950
Add your comment and style.

45
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.710
This is going to be test style.

46
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.160
What we can do is we can change the color.

47
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.510
If we call a stop sign or any color you are using.

48
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.430
And I think we're missing one.

49
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.450
And how hard you train these trainers to save.

50
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.850
We could also increase the font size, font size to maybe 17.

51
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.510
How you how the train and use control to save and maybe tweets.

52
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.850
Fun tweets.

53
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.410
That would be great.

54
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.760
And go check this out.

55
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.590
Okay.

56
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.550
And what we can also do, we can have an extra zero via.

57
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:42.150
So to do that we are going to say not to string us fist and we have to pass a minute zero once we can

58
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.490
see three or we're just going to go with two.

59
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.860
Okay.

60
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.170
And check this out.

61
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.830
You should see that.

62
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.700
Okay, cool.

63
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.340
Now.

64
00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.810
We want to have the icon button, the the command icon button, the quantity, and then the increment

65
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.650
icon button.

66
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.900
To do that, first of all.

67
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.340
Within the right, we are going to have a container.

68
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.170
Container, and we can give this container a height of maybe 35.

69
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.870
And also, we can give this container a color to be colors that maybe gray.

70
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.440
And we could also give this a shade or maybe 200 and use container and also save.

71
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.480
And in order for us to have access to a lot of properties this container have, we are then going to

72
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.150
have the decoration and this is going to be the box decoration class.

73
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.960
And what we can then do is we can give this maybe a border radius.

74
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.390
This is going to be border radius.

75
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.770
Border radius.

76
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.140
The circular of the B 15.

77
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.070
And now we have to cut out the scholar from here, because when using the boss declaration of class,

78
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.540
it expects the color to be inside that.

79
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.190
So we have to paste it over a.

80
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:18.880
The chain of command and control inside and outside this we can then have a child and the child is going

81
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.670
to be a role jet because we are going to have the minus icon, which is going to serve as the documents

82
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.360
icon.

83
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.540
We are going to have the test which is going to serve as the quantity and we are going to have the icon

84
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.480
again, which is the plus icon, which is going to serve as the increment icon.

85
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.560
And first of all, we can have an icon button.

86
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.840
And it's going to take in the press.

87
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.990
I think you've seen this before and this is going to be the icon.

88
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.900
I widget and we can use that package we had earlier installed font awesome icons.

89
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.790
This is going to be minus.

90
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.890
Minus Argentina.

91
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.910
How did you come out?

92
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.340
How did you lose control?

93
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.040
Necessary.

94
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.090
Okay.

95
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:14.970
And you should see it's over here and you can see this container and it has a height of 35, 35, and

96
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.990
it has a color of what colors those gray and some little shade of red.

97
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.320
Okay.

98
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.810
And after this icon button, we can then have a test with that.

99
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.810
For now, it's just going to say one.

100
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.700
Okay.

101
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.840
And what we can just do is we can copy this and.

102
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.380
After this test, we are going to have another icon.

103
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.600
Well, this is going to say a pause.

104
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.650
Not plug.

105
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.020
Okay.

106
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.940
And go check this out.

107
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.540
Okay.

108
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.060
Okay.

109
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.620
Some school, right?

110
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.210
Okay.

111
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:09.460
And finally, what we can then do is we turn the row where we have this prize.

112
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.510
We have the.

113
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.030
We have the.

114
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.680
Minus.

115
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.840
We have the test.

116
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.500
We have the plus.

117
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.820
What we can then do.

118
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.460
We can say main assess element.

119
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.790
Remember?

120
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.180
Like what?

121
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.230
What I said the main assess alignment is going to work oppositely for the row and for the column.

122
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.500
Right for the row.

123
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:38.410
The main axis element is going to make it go horizontal.

124
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.920
Right.

125
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.080
So you can see me as this element of space.

126
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.820
What's between?

127
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.970
What for?

128
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.980
The column is going to make it go vertical, right?

129
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.430
Okay.

130
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.470
Okay.

131
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.130
Seems cool.

132
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.140
You can see it, right?

133
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.940
Okay.

134
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.890
And we can add one more product.

135
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.630
Two cards had another.

136
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.590
How to cut and.

137
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.110
Cut screen.

138
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.670
Okay.

139
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.010
Now, what we also want to do is.

140
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.890
When we click on this, we want to go to the car screen.

141
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.190
Right.

142
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.980
To do that, we have to go to the product detail.

143
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.390
Products of product detail.

144
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.620
Where are you?

145
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.220
Okay.

146
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.140
This is where.

147
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.250
And.

148
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.030
We have.

149
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.880
The.

150
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.460
Both some --.

151
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.270
Okay.

152
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.740
This should be it over.

153
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.539
Hopefully.

154
00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.150
Yeah.

155
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.780
Now we can say Navigator.

156
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.420
To the world.

157
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.700
Dot push.

158
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.690
Okay.

159
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.840
And this is going to be my Syria.

160
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.470
Page roots.

161
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.220
Okay, I'll try and be.

162
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.430
And the beta will always take into context.

163
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.740
And we can.

164
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.520
Okay.

165
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.570
We can then return the cards.

166
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.210
I think we call this cards.

167
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.680
Touch screen.

168
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.320
Okay.

169
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.590
This is basically it.

170
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.640
And lastly, in the customer home screen.

171
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.260
Customer on screen.

172
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.090
Customer on screen.

173
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.500
Customer on screen.

174
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:31.860
Okay.

175
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:38.460
This is the way you can see we still have this center widget which is just saying shop screen.

176
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.170
Right.

177
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.320
We only changed it for the cell screen.

178
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:51.750
So in the customer home screen, we have to change it to the store screen.

179
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.960
We have created already store screen.

180
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.530
Okay.

181
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.120
And I'll give this a thought.

182
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.050
We start.

183
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.340
Okay.

184
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.640
I think this took.

185
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.560
A lot of energy.

186
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:11.480
Okay.

187
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.030
All three starting and.

188
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.700
Hopefully we are not going to have any issues for sure.

189
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.840
Okay.

190
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.280
Now let's go try this out.

191
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.380
It has to restart this.

192
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.050
And.

193
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.470
Okay.

194
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.250
Log in.

195
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.090
You can just create an account if you don't have any.

196
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.240
But just make sure you are logging in.

197
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.690
You're going to log in to the right account.

198
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.090
That is the customer account and add me.

199
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.870
The NSC.

200
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.310
Okay.

201
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.090
Great.

202
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.230
And.

203
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.470
And.

204
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.590
And click on shop.

205
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.270
Okay, great.

206
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.240
Or maybe we could just rename this store.

207
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.770
We have that way.

208
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.710
Okay.

209
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.470
This is going to be store.

210
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.150
Okay.

211
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.270
Maybe we have to.

212
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:12.620
Okay.

213
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.200
Sorry.

214
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.890
Okay.

215
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.440
Working as expected.

216
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.670
Sounds cool.

217
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.430
Okay.

218
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.180
And.

219
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.380
Click on this.

220
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:28.870
Since.

221
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.410
Right.

222
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.250
And this.

223
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.670
Okay.

224
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.510
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
