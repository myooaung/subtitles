00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.850
Worker In this lecture, we're going to have a test under each icon.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.890
Okay, then let's do this.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.290
We're gonna need to go back to Our Vinci Code, and then there is a go icon file.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.770
Okay.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.370
And now we can then use country and B in order to make this white.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.790
Okay.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.780
Then you can see over here we are simply returning a container and a container which it can basically

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.310
take just a and which is just the icon that we have.

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.450
Right.

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.870
Okay.

12
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.050
Now, in order to have it sense widgets under each icon, we are going to be using the widget known

13
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.980
as column.

14
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.710
And the reason for the column is a column widget.

15
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.550
Will F.C will help you display your widgets vertically.

16
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.310
That's from top to bottom.

17
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.730
Okay.

18
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.200
So now all we can do is we can get rid of this container for now.

19
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.430
Okay.

20
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.010
Use, contribute and see to copy it.

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.150
And now we can then have the column widget.

22
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.269
And as you know, the column can't take multiple widgets.

23
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.430
So it's as this children are the first child is not going to be the container.

24
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.900
Okay.

25
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.540
Now, since there's no longer hands here, we're going to need to get rid of this and had it turn a

26
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.930
corner.

27
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.980
And over here, we are going to need to have a semicolon.

28
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.550
Okay.

29
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.930
Grids.

30
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.040
Okay.

31
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.130
This is the first chart of the container.

32
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.580
So this is the first chart of the column, which is what?

33
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.360
A container.

34
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.290
Okay.

35
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.540
And now we can have the second child, which is going to be a test.

36
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.330
Right now is where we can make this dynamic.

37
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.960
So what we can do is over here, we are going to create a final variable and we can just call this test.

38
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.900
And that's why we can specify the type.

39
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.720
It is a type.

40
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.730
It is a type of what string?

41
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.990
And over here, we can pass it on to the constructor.

42
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.280
This does.

43
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.570
This test.

44
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.940
And are.

45
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.290
Yeah.

46
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.680
We can make it through quite.

47
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.710
Okay.

48
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.669
And.

49
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.830
Over there.

50
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.440
We can then see tests.

51
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.140
Okay.

52
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.010
Is country.

53
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.880
And that's the save.

54
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.240
And now you can see we have this error because it wants us to pass.

55
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.070
It's like for the test.

56
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.520
Already have it the way it the first is going to be.

57
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.140
What's new mid-game.

58
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.890
Okay.

59
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.060
New.

60
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.040
Within.

61
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.860
And as well test okay is going to be what.

62
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.880
Meeting and the icon is at the boss rounded.

63
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.230
Okay.

64
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.680
Join.

65
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.530
Meet him.

66
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.630
The icons are going to be icons.

67
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.130
That's.

68
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.670
Had.

69
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.810
On the score.

70
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.910
Books rounded.

71
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.280
Okay as well.

72
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.180
Here.

73
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.330
Test and.

74
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.900
That's going to scare you because this.

75
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.160
And.

76
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.320
So.

77
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.360
And --.

78
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.090
I think I forgot to copy this.

79
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.350
Okay.

80
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.800
And that is going to be calendar today.

81
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.210
Okay, Collender.

82
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.590
Callender.

83
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.740
The score.

84
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.760
Okay.

85
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.820
Coriander.

86
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.470
On this court today.

87
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.220
Okay.

88
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.230
Our digital cover and wire test.

89
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.400
And this is going to say share screen.

90
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.250
Now, we basically don't need all this.

91
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.570
We just need that to.

92
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.150
We just need to join the chain and the screen does or muted icon does or.

93
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.460
And this will be what?

94
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.100
I roll upward.

95
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.610
I grew.

96
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.360
On the score of port.

97
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.329
Okay.

98
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.650
I tried this.

99
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.450
Okay.

100
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.330
Okay, okay.

101
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.130
And check.

102
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.850
Okay.

103
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.390
You can see.

104
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.410
Okay.

105
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.840
Now, what we can also do is.

106
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.630
Over here.

107
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.810
Reasonable action.

108
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.000
We can give society this.

109
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.350
We can see this time as you know, the test widget of the property known as Die.

110
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.340
And what we can do is we can just bring this to the next line signal on the descent fan just to have

111
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.980
a much more clean record and test.

112
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.220
Ty We can then see color and colors that what we can just see gray.

113
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.540
Okay.

114
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.160
Okay.

115
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.700
Okay.

116
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.310
Okay.

117
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.460
Not check.

118
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.650
Now, I think this is way too close to this.

119
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.400
Now, all we can do is we can give some virgin space between this icon and this.

120
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.750
Okay.

121
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.770
So to do that, this is the first which we have which is the container, which is the icon widgets.

122
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.580
Right.

123
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.180
Remember, we are basically using the container in a that's a give a height.

124
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.020
Right.

125
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.170
Height and weight with us to do it.

126
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.170
How wide we want this blue colour to be and height as well as to do it.

127
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.150
How long.

128
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.320
So we can use just as well.

129
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.680
60, 60, 60.

130
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.050
I think if you can see now, I think this is much more better.

131
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.250
Okay.

132
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.810
So with absolute allied in how it has to do it along.

133
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.530
So this is the this is always of the concern that, you know, that's all of us as to heights and weeds

134
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.020
and also to give the Icahn.

135
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.240
A caller, ID background caller.

136
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.720
Right.

137
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.080
Okay.

138
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:16.210
So now over here, we can give you space using something, a size box and working with the space vertically

139
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.590
that is from top to bottom.

140
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.650
So this is going to be height and we can just see ten.

141
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.400
Okay.

142
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.500
Contract SASE and go check it out.

143
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.370
Okay.

144
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.940
You can see.

145
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.320
Great.

146
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.040
Looking great.

147
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.410
Right?

148
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.810
Okay.

149
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.330
You can add some more styling.

150
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.180
Well, I can see font size of.

151
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.850
It's in or ten or 15 and check it out.

152
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.310
Okay.

153
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.870
Okay.

154
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.980
Okay.

155
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.040
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
