00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.870
In this lecture, we're going to have a circle avatar over here and over here, we're going to have

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.130
to icon button.

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.780
Okay.

6
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.079
Now, in order to do this, we need to go back to our second hand aside this row within the column.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.540
First of all, we can just have the comma via.

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.820
And within the column we can have another row widget.

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.690
And as you know, the rule can take multiple widgets so it as this children the first child is going

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.500
to be a widget known as Circle Circle Avatar.

11
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.130
And they're going to give it a radius that is our route is going to be a radius of 60.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.770
The watch as well.

13
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.220
Has the property known as background colour for the background colour.

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.640
We can say colours, dots can.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.900
OC is true and see and go check it out.

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.150
You're going to see the value.

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.820
Great.

18
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.260
Now, the next thing we're going to need to do is over here and here we want to have two icons.

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.340
Button How?

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.840
With my explanation, you can see these two icons are going to be displayed vertically.

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.270
That is from top to bottom.

22
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.990
Right.

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.880
So we send the column because so now it's in the column within the row and of course within the column

24
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.040
because we're basically making everything displayed for display vertically.

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.520
Sorry.

26
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.310
Yeah, vertically.

27
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.580
Right.

28
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.010
Okay.

29
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.220
That is from top to bottom.

30
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.020
Okay.

31
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.440
Like I said.

32
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.210
Over here.

33
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.530
We want to have two icon buttons.

34
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.920
Right.

35
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.530
And these two icons, button, are going to be displayed.

36
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.280
Vertically.

37
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.660
That is from top to bottom.

38
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.360
So what we can do is within the row jets, outside the circle avatar, we can just had a true cover.

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.280
Within the royal widgets.

40
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.870
We can have another column.

41
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.800
Under the collar.

42
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.800
And as they know, the column can take multiple kids as these children.

43
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.789
And the first child is going to be a container with just a container.

44
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.620
And in order to have access to lots of property, the container has.

45
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.360
So for that, they're going to be using the property known as declaration and box declaration.

46
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.620
Okay.

47
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.820
And now we can say the color is going to be color as dots can.

48
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.060
Okay.

49
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.100
And we can give this a border radius to tell how route is going to be.

50
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.190
We can say what our radius border.

51
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.700
Or we can just say we have better ideas.

52
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.220
Dot holy.

53
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.830
That's this.

54
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.100
We don't want all the sides to be around.

55
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.030
We want to specify the sides we wish to be round.

56
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.450
We can say we only want the top.

57
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.230
Left to have a radius so you can say videos.

58
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.850
Videos.

59
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.450
With the secular of 15.

60
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.250
And our digital cover and top right to have videos.

61
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.060
The circle of 15 as well.

62
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.410
And now we can have the newcomer in this country, and that's to save.

63
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.260
Okay.

64
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.610
Okay.

65
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.250
We can't see anything because we have not gave it a height or a width, right?

66
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.830
So what we can do is within this container, the container has a property known as child.

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.710
So within the container we can say child.

68
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.710
The child is going to be an icon.

69
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.850
But in icon.

70
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.630
But it.

71
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.820
Okay.

72
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.380
As you know, it's going to take the press, which is the function.

73
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.450
And for the icon, it's going to be icons.

74
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.800
Sorry, icon.

75
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.870
So this is going to be.

76
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.630
Icons.

77
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.450
Dirt camera.

78
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.970
Camera on the score heart.

79
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.520
Okay.

80
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.510
How do you recover?

81
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.590
How did you recover?

82
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.140
How did you cover this country and save?

83
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.019
I think we are missing.

84
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.209
One.

85
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.880
Okay.

86
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.730
Okay.

87
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.150
Get rid of this case.

88
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.330
Control and save.

89
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.470
And see if you can see to where we can just change this to pop or maybe or we can just go with this

90
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.130
for now.

91
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.780
Okay.

92
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.840
So what we can simply do is over this container, we can just copy this.

93
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.090
Copy.

94
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.090
First of all, how did you recover and then paste?

95
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.590
We are still within the column.

96
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.510
And it's going to be a top story.

97
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.040
It's going to be bottom left.

98
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.710
But some.

99
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.490
Left.

100
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.950
So.

101
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.050
And.

102
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.170
There's going to be short term.

103
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.450
Right.

104
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.160
So.

105
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.250
Okay, what time?

106
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.940
Right.

107
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.700
And.

108
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.700
Okay.

109
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.800
So remove the dirt.

110
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.360
This should be radius.

111
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.900
Radius, the circular.

112
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.830
And get rid of this.

113
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.220
Sorry for that.

114
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.480
Okay.

115
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.330
Now check it out.

116
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.860
Okay.

117
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.970
Now we can give space between bots.

118
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.040
So we're going to use this, which you've said before, this is the first icon.

119
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.380
This is the first icon.

120
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.830
Right.

121
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.640
And it LCA.

122
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.180
Right.

123
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.450
And this is the second.

124
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:10.040
So all we can do is we can have a size, a size pause and we are giving the space that give it the space.

125
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.940
Vertically.

126
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.210
Right.

127
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.560
So this is going to be height.

128
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.160
So we can say height of ten.

129
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.620
Okay.

130
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.100
You can try and save.

131
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.080
Okay.

132
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.660
Now what we can as well do, we can give space between these two icon and this.

133
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.590
So what we have to do is to go to.

134
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.540
The column.

135
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.590
This is it over here.

136
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.610
So this is the first side of the row.

137
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.110
The sequitur.

138
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.240
And this is the second chart of the row.

139
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.620
That is the column.

140
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.340
So what we can do, we can give a size plus or value.

141
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.910
Size bursts and we give it the space horizontally.

142
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.180
Right.

143
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.890
So this is going to be width of ten.

144
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.230
And how did you cover this?

145
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.490
Concerns to save.

146
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.440
Okay.

147
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.280
Great.

148
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.850
So now what we can simply do, we can change this icon.

149
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.730
So there's going to be icons, dots.

150
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.570
It's going to be I think we have the icon of.

151
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.480
For two.

152
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.150
Just going to check this out first.

153
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.320
I think we have for two here for two.

154
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.060
Okay.

155
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:41.810
And what we can as well do is we can increase the size of this test over to maybe 25 to make it sorry,

156
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.490
about 15, 25.

157
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.550
Okay.

158
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.010
And we can get rid of this additional as.

159
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.050
Okay.

160
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.820
Now, lastly, to make our code cleaner what we can do or to make it more cleaner, all we can do is

161
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.080
within the variety.

162
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.850
We can create a new folder and we're going to call this for the Hot.

163
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:09.830
Part.

164
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.390
Right.

165
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.200
And.

166
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.430
We can, basically.

167
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:22.730
Use control and a to a light and its see to copy this or we can just call it this.

168
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.090
And then we can delete this file.

169
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.530
Deletes deletes can't move to trash.

170
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.980
And over this art, you can basically just move it there.

171
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.650
But for some reason I just prefer it in this way.

172
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:45.300
So what we can do now is we can create a new file over this art, and we call it London.

173
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.870
I'll just call customer.

174
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.330
On the score screen.

175
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.890
Then the section is dot dot and we can just place this here.

176
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.340
Okay.

177
00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.380
And now over.

178
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.690
Yeah.

179
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.420
We can alight in this country and do what's important and we can then get rid of this.

180
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.720
Because it is not longer found.

181
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.510
Okay as well.

182
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.930
Okay.

183
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.520
So I think this is more cleaner.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:30.670
to be stored, such as the London customer screen, the seller customer screen, the logout and so forth.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.580
So I think this will be more cleaner.

187
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.560
Okay guys, see you in the next lecture.
