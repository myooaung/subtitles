00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.660
Hi.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.390
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.710
In this lecture, we are going to make our code more simpler.

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.730
Now you can see the model directory then in your products.

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
That's why we already have all this fields over here.

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.790
So there is no need of passing it over the fields products.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
So what you're going to do is you're going to get rid of all this.

8
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.460
Right.

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.010
And now we can use control in this.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.160
And the next thing to do is to go to the full screen.

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.970
Right.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.390
Okay.

13
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.430
As well are going to need to get rid of all this.

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.520
We don't really need it.

15
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.400
Okay, great.

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.160
Now what you're going to do is you're going to copy this.

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.030
Cofidis is control and C and use control and B to with the smaller they are going to go to the fields

18
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.620
to products.

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.660
And now we can use culture and be okay.

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.000
Now what we're going to do is we're going to pass this within the context.

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.830
Then is it of these products is going to be the products model.

22
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.610
Okay.

23
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.990
Now we can use Control and dot in there that supports the fly.

24
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.580
Okay.

25
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.870
It's going to take a while.

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.710
Okay.

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.690
Control and Dutch.

28
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.020
Or I'm just going to go to the other fights.

29
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.420
Okay.

30
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.820
That's where you come true and be okay.

31
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.840
Now, instead of product provider, regular call, this product's okay.

32
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.300
We'll look back on this and then let's go to the hair.

33
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.410
Okay.

34
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.160
There's going to be products that's immeasurable.

35
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.020
That is the products coming from the models.

36
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.710
Okay.

37
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.840
As or click on this.

38
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.990
It's going to be.

39
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.250
Products.

40
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.310
That's tied to the three countries as well.

41
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.870
Okay.

42
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.250
Is going to be.

43
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.370
Products at price.

44
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.270
Okay.

45
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.190
Now use control and to.

46
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.040
Okay.

47
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.300
You can see the areas that we can use the hall to start in order to save those on save twice.

48
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.640
Okay.

49
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.580
Okay.

50
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.770
Now go check it out.

51
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.280
Okay.

52
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.760
They are going to need to go back to the screen.

53
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.180
Now, you can see we have all these eras.

54
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.760
Not all these eras are going to need to go back to the fifth screen.

55
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.970
Okay.

56
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.560
Field screen.

57
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.440
Then there.

58
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.870
What is food products?

59
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.070
First of all, obviously it's control and B to make this wide.

60
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.060
Then.

61
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.340
Yeah the needs control and that's they were going to go to Europe with widgets they're going to use

62
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.270
to change.

63
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.450
Not the fire.

64
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.620
That's if I provide good value.

65
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.040
Okay.

66
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.400
We can break this down.

67
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000
The value is going to be the per products.

68
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.900
Least.

69
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.340
And now we can pass any intense.

70
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.420
Okay.

71
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.830
Now, the reason for this error is because we also need a new product model.

72
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.650
We also need to have to deal with change notifier.

73
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.040
Okay.

74
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.860
Now what it going to do if you have this error?

75
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.220
I just have to do is to use through and be like, hey, we're going to go to the products model.

76
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.980
So he.

77
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.770
Products model.

78
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.700
Okay.

79
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.150
I think you might have that in your radio.

80
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.730
Probably.

81
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.720
I deleted my.

82
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.600
So we're going to need to see with change.

83
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.800
Not a fire.

84
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.180
So what this will simply do is is going to list in for updates we are making.

85
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.740
You can see there is God.

86
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.190
Okay.

87
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.649
Now we can use the whole to start now to save those on saved face.

88
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.580
Okay.

89
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.500
The key.

90
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.870
Now let's go back to the fields.

91
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.310
Okay.

92
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.950
They can see our code is now simpler.

93
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.110
We are no longer personally teacher of other fields projects.

94
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.200
Right over here, we are simply using data that is coming from the model.

95
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.580
You can see over the model dietary in this file called products.

96
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:08.100
We have defined all the fields we need right then in the provider folder, the Novartis products, you

97
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.020
can see we are using all those.

98
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.730
Where he's in all those fields.

99
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.780
Right.

100
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.220
Okay.

101
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.280
You can see there's a production model.

102
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.750
There are signage fields that we are sending values to it.

103
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.880
Okay, then over this field.

104
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.180
Projects.

105
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.220
What we simply did was to make what is food products.

106
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.720
What you simply did was to create the available products in order to store the value of that product

107
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.190
model.

108
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.520
So we have access to all those all those value, all those fields, all I.

109
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.760
Or those fields.

110
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.960
Or via NORAD, cots provider or by the provider.

111
00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.110
What you are simply doing is we are sending orders values to those fields, right?

112
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.420
So you can see it as equals to over oversize.

113
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.360
The same thing as here.

114
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.090
This is the ID.

115
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.540
So assigning all this value to the ID, the tie two to the ID description to the ID and so on.

116
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.940
Right.

117
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.320
Okay.

118
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.150
So I think our code is more simpler.

119
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.560
Right.

120
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.910
Okay.

121
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.710
You cannot just add this to make sure of it in this walk in.

122
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.630
Okay.

123
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.590
You can do the same thing for the you are of as well.

124
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.210
Okay.

125
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.460
We're going to do the letter before they know it is going to continue with the field screen.

126
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.910
Okay.

127
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.370
Okay.

128
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.040
Sounds good.

129
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.950
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
