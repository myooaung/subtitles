00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.660
In this lecture, we are going to start our dropdown.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.390
Okay, now what we can do.

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.330
First of all, we can give some breathing space between these edges over the column.

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.700
We can say cross axis alignment.

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.730
Cross axis alignment.

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.060
Dot center to take it to the center horizontally.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.980
Okay.

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.620
And.

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.330
And.

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.650
Okay.

13
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.300
Not really much.

14
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.940
What we can also do is we can wrap this with a pad in a light and use control, controlling dot wrap

15
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.920
with padding.

16
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.660
And we're going to say five.

17
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.080
I think five is okay.

18
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.750
And go check this out.

19
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.540
You're going to see a little space over here.

20
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.940
Okay.

21
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.680
Seems good.

22
00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.200
And now what we can do is the drop down button has a property known as border radius for the border

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.750
radius.

24
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.629
We can say border radius.

25
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.770
Even though it's secular.

26
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.490
Of maybe 50.

27
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.570
Okay.

28
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.670
And save.

29
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.280
And go check it out.

30
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.490
Okay.

31
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.300
And.

32
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.910
And click on this book, you can see and now we can change the color of the test to do that within the

33
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.520
dropdown, within the dropdown button.

34
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.470
It has a property known as STI.

35
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.440
And we can then say test STI.

36
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.530
We could change the colour of the test to say colours, the sign, colours the sign and hostel.

37
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.130
We can say font suite.

38
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.100
Font.

39
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.820
Sweet.

40
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.950
From tweets that both OC and we need this is control necessary now.

41
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.970
Okay.

42
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.539
Okay.

43
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.730
Click on this link, you can see some skirt or maybe you could just get rid of this color.

44
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.210
Okay.

45
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.700
And now, instead of this default color we have for the floating action button within the floating Asian

46
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.990
button, it has a property known as background color and we can then say colors the sign.

47
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660
And train camera.

48
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.260
And over a year.

49
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.710
For the order.

50
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.040
I think we have to and for the order background color colors that sign.

51
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.670
Okay.

52
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.500
Just control and save.

53
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.340
Okay.

54
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.350
And.

55
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.510
And I think it's taken.

56
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.760
Look I think they it it took the colour of white since we are isn't the star and we can't longer see

57
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.360
that.

58
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.880
Look, we're just going to use maybe black.

59
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.850
Over year.

60
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.800
Where?

61
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.720
Okay.

62
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.540
This notice we can.

63
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.600
Is black.

64
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.150
Colour colours the black.

65
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.800
Is control necessary?

66
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.690
You can click on this.

67
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.310
And I think it's taking longer these days.

68
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.590
Okay.

69
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.410
Simms Good.

70
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.180
You can just do this.

71
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.590
You can just hard for the older men and.

72
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.620
It is.

73
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.400
Okay.

74
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.430
And lastly, we are going to solve an issue.

75
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.110
Now click on this category and you can see we have this error.

76
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:11.510
And the reason for this is because we recently updated our category list with an extra value.

77
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.300
That is the subcategory value.

78
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.870
And because of that, the index is going to be mismatched.

79
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.630
So what we can do to update that, we have to go to the categories directory and hopefully you have

80
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.510
a list of categories and you can see for now I have just the main category created what you can just

81
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.910
create for the order, like the women shoes, kids and others.

82
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.130
And now what we have to do is you can see we have this a.

83
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:52.650
The men don't lens, which has to do with how many high temps we are going to have over here.

84
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.790
Right.

85
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.750
For this.

86
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.590
We know that to solve that error, we can minus one from it.

87
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.100
So it's not going to start content from the.

88
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.240
The first item we have over that is the.

89
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.010
The SOB.

90
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.390
That is the subcategory we have over here.

91
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.110
Right.

92
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.680
Okay.

93
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.840
And back to that.

94
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.000
So.

95
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.250
Okay.

96
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.220
It's controller and that's the save.

97
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.680
Sorry.

98
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.510
Not there.

99
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.900
Main category.

100
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.100
Okay.

101
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.350
Also, we have to increase the you can see we have this test, which is which is a subcategory value,

102
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.130
we have to say, plus one to increase it plus one.

103
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.590
So over here we are decreasing the length and for the subcategory name we are increasing by one.

104
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.740
And lastly, over here, we also have to say plus one.

105
00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.040
Okay, I know you want to understand this, but most of the time you just have to go back to where we

106
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.720
created this categories directory and this main category because definitely you will forget most of

107
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.640
the things we are doing, but most of the time just have to go back to recheck again and that to understand.

108
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.580
Okay, you can see currently I have just this main category, but hopefully you have created the rest

109
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.020
categories yourself.

110
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.040
That is for the women and others.

111
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.720
You can see now.

112
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.800
It is now back.

113
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.950
Shared is shared.

114
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.260
T shirt is t shirt.

115
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.820
Jacket is jacket.

116
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.200
Suits is okay.

117
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.250
This is not suits.

118
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.090
I think that was a mistake we made before when creating this.

119
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.170
Okay.

120
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.110
And hopefully you've created for the women you've created for.

121
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.530
These shoes.

122
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:56.360
And if you've done that, all you just have to do is to change it the same way I just did.

123
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.320
But if you have not stock, the major thing is you understand what we are trying to do.

124
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.440
But I know definitely you must have forgotten what I just did, but most of the time you would want

125
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.690
to go back to the previous lecture.

126
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.420
You know, that's again, more understanding.

127
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.100
Right.

128
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.800
Okay.
