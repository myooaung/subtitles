00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.540
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.320
In this lecture, Robin creates the video models.

4
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.590
Okay, now, what is model Zaatari?

5
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.700
We are going to create a new PHI, and we're going to call this video darts.

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.530
That's okay.

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.780
Now, the first thing to do is to create a class, and we're going to call this class of video.

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.950
Okay?

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.240
And now we are going to create the fields we need for the video.

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.630
Okay.

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.950
You can say finer.

12
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:37.980
And streaming and the user name uploading the video and as well fina the UID of the user uploaded the

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.440
video and it's going to be a detail type of string, right?

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.990
Okay.

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.520
And that's all fine on the I.D..

16
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.410
Okay, then shrink.

17
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.990
Okay.

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.020
As all finer and stringy we can see the likes of his our menu lacks the video currently has and as well

19
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.590
we can.

20
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.400
So fine a string.

21
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.260
We can say comments.

22
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.890
Counts.

23
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.020
How many comments.

24
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.670
The video has.

25
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.030
FINA and.

26
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.150
Strange because as all share counts.

27
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.940
Okay.

28
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.080
This is going to be in.

29
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.390
Right.

30
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.920
The share count is going to be you can just see it.

31
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.660
Okay.

32
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.310
And as well string.

33
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.650
And this is going to be.

34
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.230
The we can't just say song name.

35
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.910
Okay.

36
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.770
Right.

37
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.380
And.

38
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.500
As well.

39
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.550
We can make this.

40
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.670
Find out.

41
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.680
Okay.

42
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.690
And what did I feel?

43
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.670
The way they'd find us trying to capture.

44
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.620
Capture and.

45
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.940
Find a string as well.

46
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.310
The video.

47
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.580
You are real, right?

48
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.250
We need that.

49
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.360
And find a string.

50
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.050
The thumbnail.

51
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.960
We got Tom.

52
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.730
No, we got from the video.

53
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.330
Or the video image.

54
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.800
Okay.

55
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.990
Finer and.

56
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.390
The profile for two.

57
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.940
Okay.

58
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.500
And what we need to do is to pass it on to the constructor.

59
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.160
Before then.

60
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.670
I'm just going to make sure we are not missing in the field.

61
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.940
Okay?

62
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.000
We need to use a name.

63
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.990
We need the.

64
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.110
We need to hide the likes.

65
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.740
The comments counts, the share counts.

66
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.590
His song name to capture the video URL, the Tom Neal and the profile photo.

67
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.010
Right.

68
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.350
Okay.

69
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.850
As well we can specify it is a type of string.

70
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.130
Shrink and now we need to eye light and use control and dots creates constructive or a fields.

71
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.300
I'm trying to be.

72
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.970
Okay.

73
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.260
Running this.

74
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.400
Okay.

75
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.920
Now, all we need to do is to have this collar brackets.

76
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.300
And.

77
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.970
Over years of law and then require for this.

78
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.230
But it required.

79
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.000
Okay.

80
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.770
Required.

81
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.600
Okay.

82
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.090
Required.

83
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.010
Okay.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.980
Required.

85
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.040
As well required.

86
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.670
Okay.

87
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.080
Okay.

88
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.890
Required.

89
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.800
Okay.

90
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.820
Required.

91
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.270
Okay.

92
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.829
We still have some more required and required.

93
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.800
And.

94
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.839

95
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.800
Okay.

96
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.140
I think we listen for the end.

97
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.930
We can just say fine as well for now.

98
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.500
Okay.

99
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.940
And we need to pass it.

100
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.260
Okay.

101
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.040
After the comet counts, we can just say this.

102
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.890
That.

103
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.400
The.

104
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.150
This dearth.

105
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.730
What's so Cher can't.

106
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.370
And as well, we can require this.

107
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.780
Okay.

108
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.800
Okay.

109
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.910
Now contra and say, okay, now this all this feels we need for each video.

110
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.870
That is the user name, the user ID, Heidi.

111
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.240
The that is the idea of the video.

112
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.970
This is going to be the idea of the user and the likes of many likes.

113
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.800
The video has the comments counts on many convert.

114
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.870
It has many shares.

115
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:24.880

117
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.610
Okay, so this is basically all the fields we need for the uploaded video, right?

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.060
Okay, guys, see you in the next picture.
