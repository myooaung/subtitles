00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lecture, we're going to continue for real stops.

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.029
So we're going to have the hot Scots of Watson.

5
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:08.460
Okay.

6
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.300
Not to do that, I will need to go back to our visa code and then the detailed directory and then the

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.110
detail page.

8
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.500
Okay.

9
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.350
And now we can use control and B to make this way.

10
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.740
Okay.

11
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.820
Now the last lecture we have the rural right and the reason is that we want to have our widget displayed

12
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.670
horizontally, that is from left to right.

13
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690
And the first child of the row is a column widget, right?

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.330
Because we want to add it says court price and it put up price and we want both widgets to be displayed

15
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.740
vertically.

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.470
That's from top to bottom.

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.800
Right.

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.130
Okay.

19
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.680
So we are going to come out from this column widget.

20
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
You know, that's one of the hotspots over here, right?

21
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.980
Okay.

22
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.140
So attaching a comma first and level of comfort from this column widget.

23
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.410
Okay.

24
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.190
Okay.

25
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.730
Now we're going to be using the blockchain known as the elevated.

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.710
Bottom.

27
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.250
Okay.

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.690
Is going to take the oppressed so we can make them function empty for now.

29
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.170
Okay.

30
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.670
Now the child is going to be a role.

31
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.110
You're going to see why it's going to be a role.

32
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.390
It's going to be a role which adds.

33
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.630
And as you know, the rule can take multiple widgets or it has to do it.

34
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.380
Okay, now use country and that's to save for us and go check it out.

35
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.340
You didn't see over here.

36
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.270
Okay, now what we can do is we can wrap this elevator box in an expanded which at sea take the available

37
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.910
space.

38
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.260
Okay.

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.510
Control and guts.

40
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.400
Okay.

41
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440
Now, since we don't have the widget list that year, we're going to go for the wrap widgets from the

42
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.200
wrap, this week's elevated elevated said.

43
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.650
Okay.

44
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.050
So he.

45
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.600
Not elevated, but as Pandit responded.

46
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.500
Okay.

47
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.320
So is going to make this bottom take the available space.

48
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.340
Can I go check it out?

49
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.670
Okay.

50
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.180
You can see now what we can then do is.

51
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.480
Well, what is what's and we can't wrap it with the container and give it a height.

52
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.170
So is control and that's wrapped with container.

53
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.490
Okay.

54
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.930
We're going to give the bus to the heights.

55
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.660
So.

56
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.490
Sorry.

57
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.330
Sorry, sorry.

58
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.730
Okay.

59
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.160
Of higher heights.

60
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.510
Of 60.

61
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.850
Okay.

62
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.720
Now.

63
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.420
So for that East culture and that's safe and good.

64
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.990
Check it out.

65
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.210
Okay.

66
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.490
Now you're going to see the need for this rule widgets.

67
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.790
Okay.

68
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.550
So the next thing we are going to do is over here.

69
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.750
We'll have a test and lawyers are going to have an icon.

70
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.510
Widgets.

71
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.850
Okay, so that was why we knew we needed to use this rule.

72
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.570
So although you're the first child.

73
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.930
It's going to be a test which is just going to say hard to cut.

74
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.550
Right.

75
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.410
It's kind of true and excessive.

76
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.420
We can as well as just check it out first.

77
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.880
You can see the way it became.

78
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.660
I was tiring.

79
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.080
There's no tests, I.

80
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.740
And again can give me font size of 20.

81
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.630
Original cover and go check it out.

82
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.530
Okay.

83
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.670
And.

84
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.590
This is the first with jets.

85
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.420
The second jets.

86
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.930
It's going to be an icon.

87
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.570
Widgets.

88
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.290
It's going to be.

89
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.600
It's going to be high class.

90
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.190
Dutch champion.

91
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.470
On this score that's in reality, on the scorecards, on the score line.

92
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.550
Okay.

93
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.330
Ed Coma.

94
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.070
Ed Coma and use control and save.

95
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.700
Okay.

96
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.900
You can see the value that we can give so space between this advocates this and this I combatives relative

97
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.000
to the civil rights.

98
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.100
Okay so we can now excise books.

99
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.710
Sized with the size books, we are giving the space horizontally.

100
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.570
So it is going to be weights of probably ten to see how they're going to look like first.

101
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.230
Yes.

102
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.940
I have to keep checking it out to.

103
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.210
Once you have your test.

104
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.490
Okay, they're going to need to give some space between this and this.

105
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.970
Okay.

106
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.530
So.

107
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.470
Just pondered.

108
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.280
Okay.

109
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.430
So that we can then harvest books as well.

110
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.980
Says works.

111
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.590
Of.

112
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.420
So it is going to be weeks of 15 year touring and youth culture and a.

113
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.400
Okay.

114
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.000
Great.

115
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.560
Now, we can't give sauce tie to this.

116
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.970
Okay.

117
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.200
Now, why this elevator button, this elevated bottom, has a property known as Ty.

118
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.010
Okay.

119
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.560
We can then see elevated.

120
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.580
Elevated boats in the sky.

121
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.560
From.

122
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.990
Okay.

123
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.620
Now, the first thing we can do is we can have some rounded ship so we can't see a ship is going to

124
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.080
be rounded.

125
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.750
Rounded rectangle border.

126
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.500
Okay.

127
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.450
You can then give them whatever videos it is.

128
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.920
This is going to be what?

129
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.730
Our videos.

130
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.880
What are videos?

131
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.520
The sick or 15?

132
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.710
They're just looking to see who's going to look like, okay, you're in a coma and hold your true coma

133
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.840
and use control and save.

134
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.800
Okay.

135
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.410
Great.

136
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.150
And what we can also do is.

137
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.350
Over here.

138
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.880
We can't move the elevation.

139
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.360
We can see elevation, the elevated.

140
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.540
So we've seen the star from think it has a property known as elevation.

141
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.530
You can see zero.

142
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.320
Okay.

143
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.330
Not much difference.

144
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.400
We can observe how the trail como layer.

145
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.580
Okay.

146
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.650
Now, what we can do is we can change the colour of this button.

147
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.030
Okay.

148
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.920
Now, this property as well, that is this Thai elevated button, those type from has a property known

149
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.570
as primary.

150
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.110
Okay.

151
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.820
You can see color starts.

152
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.680
BLOCK okay.

153
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.820
Okay.

154
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.390
Great.

155
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.500
And once again, as well as we can take this to the media.

156
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.010
Okay.

157
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.830
So what is wrong with Jets?

158
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.790
You can't say.

159
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.490
I mean, as I said, I mean, us is.

160
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.140
Alignments.

161
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.610
The center.

162
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.090
Okay.

163
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.530
Okay.

164
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.940
Great.

165
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.480
Now, you don't need to worry too much about this.

166
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:45.540
The shot description writes In your future and I have this shot, this is going to be very long.

167
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.470
And what you can then do is we can make this space scrollable.

168
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.860
Right?

169
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.510
So in future, we're going to do that.

170
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:58.520
We're going to make the space scrollable because we're going to be having a very long, productive discussion.

171
00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:58.770
Okay.

172
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.370
So for now, we can just go with this.

173
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:01.620
Okay.

174
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.020
We can check this out.

175
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.380
Okay.

176
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.190
Check for this.

177
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.990
Okay, great.

178
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.520
So that's good.

179
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.700
Right now, if we do understand, you can let me know.

180
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.380
So I try my best to then try my best to explain the for you.

181
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:16.800
Okay.

182
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:18.520
Okay.

183
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.050
We can see we can just increase the price.

184
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.120
Fonts.

185
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.800
