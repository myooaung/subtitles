00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.650
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.700
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.150
In this lecture, we are going to create the bottom sheds.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.770
Okay, now, outside the single square view and within the scaffold, we are going to say bottom shed.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.430
And what we want to do is over year, we are going to have three buttons.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.150
One is going to be for the store icon, the other is going to be for the shopping carts.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.240
And the third is going to be for the hard to cut button.

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.770
Okay.

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.760
Now, with what I just explained, you can see this theory.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.880
Buttons are going to be displayed horizontally.

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.240
That is from left to right.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.780
Right.

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.410
So for this purpose, we are going to be using a row widget.

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.130
And as you know, a row can take multiple widgets which are going to be displayed horizontally.

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.290
So it has these children.

16
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.370
And the first chart is going to be an icon button because as well the icon is going to be clickable.

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.130
Okay, this is a function and for the icon, it's going to take in the icon widget.

18
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.780
And this is going to be icons.

19
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.010
Icons dot store.

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.610
Okay store.

21
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.570
Okay.

22
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.080
Are you trying to hide your chain of command and use control and has to save and go check it out?

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.660
You're going to see the wire.

24
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.860
Okay, Cisco.

25
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.830
And now we can just copy this.

26
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.510
And so.

27
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.910
Copy this.

28
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.060
Hold your cucumber and paste.

29
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.710
This is going to be icons.

30
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.140
Dot shopping.

31
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.280
Chopin on the score cards.

32
00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.750
Okay.

33
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.200
How did your newcomer and use control and has the save and go check it out.

34
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.840
Okay.

35
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.050
Okay.

36
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.979
Since Q and for the heart to cut.

37
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.850
But then what we can do we can go to the cut screen.

38
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.370
And you can see we have this button for the checkout.

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.050
So what we can just do is you can copy this.

40
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.650
It ends over here.

41
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.720
Use concurrency to copy and head back to the product detail screen and.

42
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.340
I'm just going to use Contra and B and how hard you're trying to cover and then paste.

43
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.330
Then it's it'll check out.

44
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.580
This is going to say hard.

45
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.840
To.

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.410
Class.

47
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.480
Okay to cut.

48
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.670
Okay.

49
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.990
Sorry.

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.900
Okay.

51
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.210
Okay.

52
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.510
Just control and save now and check it out.

53
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.960
Okay.

54
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.100
You gonna sit over here?

55
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.370
Okay.

56
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.430
And what we can do instead of block, we can use maybe close the sign.

57
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.080
Each country needs to save.

58
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.940
And go check it out.

59
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.310
Okay.

60
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.280
I think his way to round it.

61
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.090
We can just make this f 15 comma.

62
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.510
And we check it out.

63
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.510
Okay.

64
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.620
This is okay.

65
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:48.550
And now what we can do is within the rule, we can then say Assess alignment, main, assess alignment.

66
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.160
The space between.

67
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.700
Okay.

68
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.220
It's going to be coming out.

69
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.970
And you can see we have no space.

70
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.320
So what we can then do is we can wrap this rule with a pardon.

71
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.320
Pardon?

72
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.630
Of maybe ten years control to save.

73
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.340
And go check it out.

74
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.600
Okay.

75
00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.550
Cisco.

76
00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.570
I think ten is way too much.

77
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.010
We can just go with AIDS.

78
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.140
Okay.

79
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.850
Same.

80
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.730
Cool.

81
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.240
Right.

82
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.690
Okay.

83
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.030
To cut and.

84
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.280
You're just going to use a capital letter for this?

85
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.340
Okay.

86
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.690
Okay.

87
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.500
Sounds cool.

88
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.610
Looking very, very nice.

89
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.630
And you can just check this out for another product and maybe from the women's category.

90
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.210
Okay.

91
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.560
This.

92
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.640
Cisco.

93
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.150
Okay, guys.
