00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.980
In this lecture, we will create the search field, and we're going to create the search field in the

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.820
home screen.

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.230
So what we can do is within the screens.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.670
Sorry, views.

7
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.250
We are going to create a new fight and we're going to call this fight home on the score screen.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.200
And dot, dot.

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.410
And now we can use control and be.

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.870
And for now, we can use this stateless widget and home screen.

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.860
And over here, we need to alight and use control dots in order to import the material to that package.

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.280
And then that will have access to lots more property.

13
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.810
We can then return a scaffold it scaffold widgets.

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.440
Okay, now use control and save.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.870
And over the customer on screen.

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.180
We are going to need to get rid of this.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.990
And we're going to call the home.

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.129
Home screen.

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.810
How did you recover?

20
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.520
Okay, great.

21
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.250
And so now we are going to create the surge, the surge field.

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.540
Now back to the customer.

23
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.590
But sorry.

24
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.400
Back to the home screen and.

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.110
Over discovered.

26
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.360
What we need to do is.

27
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.800
We are going to have a harbour.

28
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.150
Harbour.

29
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.240
And Harbour.

30
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.670
Okay.

31
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.590
Now is control.

32
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.500
Next save.

33
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.990
And you're going to see this up over here.

34
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.280
In the home.

35
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.740
We need to how to start this.

36
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.990
And you're going to see the harbour.

37
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.910
Over.

38
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.260
We just have to wait a bit for this to start.

39
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.680
And you should see the harbor.

40
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.370
Hawaii.

41
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.720
Okay.

42
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.620
This is the harbour.

43
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.680
Right.

44
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.090
Okay.

45
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.030
Now the harbour has a property known as background colour.

46
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.780
We can say background colour is going to be colours.

47
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.090
Colours dot white.

48
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.550
Close the blinds.

49
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.230
We can use control lights to save.

50
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.260
And you're going to see why now.

51
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.870
Okay.

52
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.250
And we can sell the vision.

53
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.960
We want it to be zero.

54
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.740
Okay.

55
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.600
That's going to make it match with the scaffold background.

56
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.980
Okay, great.

57
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.850
And now all we have to do is the hub bar has a property known as title.

58
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.950
And for the title, it can be any widget such as the container.

59
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.080
And for the container we can then have.

60
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:06.210
He decoration and box decoration in order to have access to loss of containers property and one of the.

61
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.000
Assess we need is the colour so we can say colours.

62
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.650
Dirt can.

63
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.250
And we can give this a border to make it all around.

64
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.900
So we can say border.

65
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.090
Border dots hall.

66
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.020
Then once you give this order a week, that is all take is going to be a width of two and a color is

67
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.460
going to be colors that.

68
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.300
Cyril.

69
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.020
So we need to get rid.

70
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.800
We don't want a collar over the background.

71
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.060
Okay.

72
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.760
You're going to see this now.

73
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.480
Via.

74
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.150
Okay.

75
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.770
And what we can do.

76
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.920
We send the container.

77
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.580
The container has a property known as height.

78
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.350
We can say 40.

79
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.120
In cities snow.

80
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.800
Okay.

81
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:07.670
Now we can make this round that we can have the trainer come over here first and we send the box decoration.

82
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.620
The box decoration has a property known as border radius.

83
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.630
And we can say border radius.

84
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.910
Though circular of 25 that is our round is going to be okay.

85
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.020
Check it out now.

86
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.820
Okay.

87
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.910
I think this is way too take so we can just say 1.6.

88
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.880
Okay.

89
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:49.540
And over here we can have an icon it it says which is going to search for products and a search button

90
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.530
or via okay we can just use constraint B to make this wide and within the container we can just add

91
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.070
the train, come over there to know where it ends and within the container we can then have a child.

92
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.180
The child is going to be a row with that because we basically want those three widgets to be displayed

93
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.680
horizontally.

94
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.720
That is from left to right.

95
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.160
Okay.

96
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.340
Now the first.

97
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.670
You can, as you know, the rule can take multiple children or it can take multiple widgets, which

98
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.480
as the student as property and the first child is going to be icon icon widgets.

99
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.700
And there's going to be icons start.

100
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.810
That said.

101
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.530
The search is control and safe.

102
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.890
And you're going to see the icon of a.

103
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.700
I think therefore it is set to white so over yet the icon property, the icon widget has a property

104
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.760
known as colour and we can say colours that.

105
00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.890
Great.

106
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.390
Now you're going to see it.

107
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.710
You can see it over there.

108
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.400
And the next widget we want is.

109
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.510
It says with jets.

110
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.880
Probably this might just say, Lords, are you?

111
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.630
Looking.

112
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.330
Can.

113
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.770
Looking.

114
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.980
For you try and save and you're going to see the value in now.

115
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.330
Okay.

116
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.800
Default, I think it is set to white as well and we can have a STI.

117
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.160
This is going to be tests i.

118
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.950
Then the caller is going to be callers that.

119
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.550
Gray.

120
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.640
And we can increase the font size to 18.

121
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.640
We need this idea to use control and save.

122
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.850
And you're going to see it via.

123
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.480
Okay.

124
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.130
Great.

125
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.990
And now, finally, what we can do is over here.

126
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.350
We can then have.

127
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.390
We can then have the bottom or something that's going to serve as a button.

128
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.580
Okay.

129
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.950
How do we tell the role we can then have another container.

130
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.050
Another container?

131
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.180
We can just go ahead and give this container a a height.

132
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.520
That is how long is going to be a height of 33 and a width of.

133
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.780
The weeds of.

134
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.960
Of 75.

135
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.970
That is our it is going to be the height is how long it's going to be and the height is how wide it's

136
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.630
going to be.

137
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.900
Okay.

138
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.180
Now I know that you have access to some additional property.

139
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.680
The container has.

140
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.930
We need the declaration.

141
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.180
And then the box decoration.

142
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.990
The box decoration.

143
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.730
And we can then say, caller, there's going to be callers that can.

144
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.020
I did turn the corner and use control and that's the save.

145
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.130
You're going to see it over here.

146
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.070
You can see it over there and we can just go ahead and make this a bit rounded.

147
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.440
So we can then say border radius and there's going to be border.

148
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.470
Radius.

149
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.630
Radius the circle of 25 as well.

150
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.340
Use control and save.

151
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:46.880
Okay.

152
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.630
Great.

153
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.690
And we can just have the trill come over here.

154
00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:00.430
And within the container we can then have a child, which is going to be a test widget and the test

155
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.660
is going to say search.

156
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:08.170
Okay and as well we can have some started to this is going to be test.

157
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:16.590
Says tie and color is going to be colors that gray, colors the gray.

158
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.470
And we can increase the font size so we can just see why it's not gray.

159
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.840
Cause those whites.

160
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.530
Okay.

161
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.720
And it's going to be font size of its own.

162
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.070
Okay.

163
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.470
You can try and save.

164
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.770
I think we are missing one additional parenthesis on case control and that's the save now.

165
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.050
And you're going to see the via.

166
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.060
Okay.

167
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.420
Now we can make sure this test is at the middle of this container.

168
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:52.690
So over this over this test we get, we can highlight and use control dots and wrap it with the sensor.

169
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:59.780
Widgets and we can also reduce the font size to maybe 15.

170
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.610
Okay.

171
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.960
15 is okay.

172
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.450
Okay.

173
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.780
I think that is okay.

174
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:17.890
And within the rule, the rule has a property known as main assets element and we can say main assets

175
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.730
elements.

176
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:25.100
Main axis alignment the space between and save.

177
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.160
You know what this does.

178
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.830
So this is going to be.

179
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.670
Yeah, it gives equal space like.

180
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:41.830
And I think we can increase the size of the icon like this is the icon, the icon with the property

181
