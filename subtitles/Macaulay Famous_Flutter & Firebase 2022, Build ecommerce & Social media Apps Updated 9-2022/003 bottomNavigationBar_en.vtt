00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.660
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.260
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.570
Now this lecture, we are going to create the bottom navigation bar so that users are going to be able

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.030
to easily navigate with ten pages.

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.870
Okay.

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.400
Now let's do this.

7
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.120
Okay.

8
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.090
First of all, I will go back to our visa code.

9
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.040
Then I'm going to go to the bottom nav bar.

10
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.570
Fine.

11
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.300
This is it.

12
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.250
Okay, first of all, I'm going to get rid of this buddy for now.

13
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.810
Okay.

14
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.990
Noble, creative.

15
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.860
What's it about?

16
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.220
Right.

17
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.080
So in Flutter there is something known as bottom navigation bar.

18
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.010
So that's a capital letter.

19
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.620
Okay, as well.

20
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.310
You're going to say bottom which capital B now but.

21
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.380
But, um.

22
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.850
Navigation bar.

23
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.910
Okay.

24
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.060
See, we have this red.

25
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.410
Now it is because it wants us to pass those items.

26
00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.980
Okay.

27
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.310
Now, for the items, you're going to say we want what is known as bottom.

28
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.050
Navigation bar, I-10.

29
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.450
Okay.

30
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.910
Now for the icons and for the pages, we need already have some icons here.

31
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.790
So I don't forget.

32
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.350
Forget.

33
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
Now, the first page we need is the whole page.

34
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.090
Right.

35
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.170
Okay.

36
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.640
So this is going to be.

37
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.180
I called.

38
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.690
We did.

39
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.920
I called.

40
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.460
We did.

41
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.720
Right.

42
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.820
So this is going to be I cause dot home, right?

43
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.340
Okay.

44
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.930
Now you can give a comma, then you can give it size to the icon or the techy.

45
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.130
Or if he's too big, you can reduce it or it will have more to it.

46
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.150
Okay.

47
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.160
Now as well, they're going to add in the test sets.

48
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.640
And so we just need to add a comma.

49
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.230
So we're going to see a.

50
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.670
Home.

51
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.270
Right.

52
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.710
Okay.

53
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.330
Make sure you don't see it for now because this is it.

54
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.960
So it is at least a little bit more than one.

55
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.300
But pages is that.

56
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.090
It is bit than one, but by by.

57
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.850
So if you're going to save now, you're going to get an error.

58
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.950
Like I said, I'm going to do it again.

59
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.210
But.

60
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.510
Navigation bar.

61
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.920
Item.

62
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.450
I think we need to have a truly committed.

63
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.140
Okay, great.

64
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.250
Now for the next icon, it's going to be for the fields.

65
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.480
Okay.

66
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.160
So this is going to be I call the widgets.

67
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.710
And it's going to be a cause.

68
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.920
I cause the words that are as it's okay.

69
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.470
Great.

70
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.090
Now, I was going to give this size to this icon of public.

71
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.970
Like I said, you don't really need to follow exactly what I'm doing because it will give your own style.

72
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.450
Right.

73
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.070
So you can give a call to that icon if you like.

74
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.030
Same color.

75
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.630
Okay.

76
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.410
Now we're going to give a little bit.

77
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.360
So this is the icon.

78
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.710
I call Wichita State.

79
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.130
And here they're going to say, comma, it's going to be live there.

80
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.810
Then they're going to use.

81
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.030
Right.

82
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.510
Okay.

83
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.630
I'll get you in a coma.

84
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.740
Okay.

85
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.900
But I'm just gonna do this one last time.

86
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.320
That a little.

87
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.010
The rest.

88
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.830
I'm doing this again for the sake of restraint.

89
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.810
If I can just show the copies of the icon we did, I.

90
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.690
Cause I think I just have to check over in this case, which is going to cause dosage.

91
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.230
As well.

92
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.250
They're going to give this size.

93
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.500
20.

94
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.030
Right?

95
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.630
I think.

96
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.270
We need this.

97
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.170
Yes.

98
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.960
I need this.

99
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.550
Okay, then they're going to give you a liver.

100
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.330
Of search.

101
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.490
Right.

102
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.940
Okay.

103
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.140
Now I can simply copy this, I think, over the needing five page.

104
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.360
Though, you're going to see this in action very soon.

105
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.850
Okay.

106
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.800
So let's think this is one, 2 to 4.

107
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.730
I need another and another.

108
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.390
Okay.

109
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.810
Now you're going to change this after the search.

110
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.540
The next icon really, really needs to.

111
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.530
Shopping bag.

112
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.040
I closed the shopping bag.

113
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.880
Okay.

114
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.700
I think that is the Carter Page.

115
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.200
Okay.

116
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.120
So there's going to be a cause that champagne.

117
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.380
Champagne.

118
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.280
Champagne.

119
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.870
Okay.

120
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.440
So this is going to be the cuts page that cuts.

121
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.320
Can I just describe what?

122
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.580
It's a little shiatsu.

123
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.040
That's just okay.

124
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.200
Now for the.

125
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.320
I think this is going to be the last pages, the upload.

126
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.320
Upload stage.

127
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.580
Because that's okay.

128
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.060
So.

129
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.470
Okay.

130
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.680
Yes, it should be.

131
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.270
I think the person the property should be the last page to.

132
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.640
This should be a.

133
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.760
I cause that upload.

134
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.940
If we have any icons that go to.

135
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.370
Okay.

136
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.920
Upload.

137
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.450
Okay, great.

138
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.140
Now for this is going to be icons that the person.

139
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.690
Right.

140
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.210
Okay.

141
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.620
So this is going to be.

142
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.540
Upload.

143
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.860
So.

144
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.380
Jesus, I think I just have this.

145
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.550
You're serious?

146
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.020
Okay, look.

147
00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.910
Upload.

148
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.120
Then the last is going to be.

149
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.380
Person, right?

150
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.940
And yes, he is evidently Duchess of Windsor.

151
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.860
She outsiders.

152
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.550
You can try this to save.

153
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.610
I take the kids.

154
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.890
You can see this head of all.

155
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.650
Probably because it is why I tried what you can do.

156
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.370
We can give a call to this or we're just going to break this down.

157
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.520
Then you're going to see background color.

158
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.410
Background color.

159
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.270
That is the black.

160
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.990
Hopefully we can see this now.

161
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.170
Okay.

162
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.730
I think it is not.

163
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.940
You should be here.

164
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.570
That is the what's on the vacation item.

165
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.800
Okay.

166
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.370
Which is good.

167
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.330
Check it out now.

168
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.440
Okay, great.

169
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.690
Looking beautiful.

170
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.480
So the bottom navigation bar.

171
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:23.890
So it is and this but some of it's not this important I guess I just say we want to change the background

172
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.180
of all the item.

173
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.220
So now we're going to get rid of.

174
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.110
This.

175
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.780
So don't give us so much code that does not.

176
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.180
Okay.

177
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.860
So it is basically it's.

178
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.000
Right.

179
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.310
Okay.

180
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.520
So this is the upload.

181
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.950
This is the profile.

182
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.290
The.

183
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.110
Right.

184
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.550
Okay.

185
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.900
Okay, guys.

186
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.890
See you in the next.
