00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:01.940
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.430
Welcome.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.400
Now when a user is trying to create an account, of course, you know, there might be a bit delay and

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.520
these days they're going to know if their account is being created or not.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.980
So what we can do is we can create a loden screen over here.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.170
So embedded is a timestamps on register.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.370
It's going to start loading.

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
So this is going to know that the account is being created.

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.150
Okay.

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.590
Not to do this.

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.360
What we just have to do is look at the top.

12
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.770
Okay.

13
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.740
That's why we're going to create a variable which is a true and a force variable.

14
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.330
So we can.

15
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.740
So we can call this variable over this call is loaded.

16
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.010
They're going to set it to false for now.

17
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.090
Okay.

18
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.430
Then it sees it.

19
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.410
Type of bool.

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.920
Okay.

21
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.730
Great.

22
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.580
Now, what they can do next is.

23
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.709
Over a year we can sit states.

24
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.100
Then we can sit on the score is loaded.

25
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770
Is equal to.

26
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.370
So true.

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.260
So if we start loading.

28
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.230
Then after it finishes creating the accounts that is after here.

29
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.190
Before the earth.

30
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.110
Okay.

31
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.140
We can then set dates again.

32
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.030
They were going to sit on the score is loaded is equal to force.

33
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.420
Okay.

34
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.620
Great.

35
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.330
Now.

36
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.260
Okay, so we need to had a semicolon.

37
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.130
Okay.

38
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.610
Now what you're going to do over the register test.

39
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.490
I'm just going to look for that.

40
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.210
Okay.

41
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.200
This is a divided.

42
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.610
Now you're going to check it on the score is.

43
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.450
Loaded.

44
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.680
That is if it is loaded.

45
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.250
Then.

46
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.910
Okay, then.

47
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.850
We want to use a central widget.

48
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.680
Sorry.

49
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.120
Okay.

50
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.780
They're going to have a child.

51
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.210
Then there's a circular.

52
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.240
Circular circle of circle.

53
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.710
La.

54
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.110
Can't we just feel good progress and the kids are okay.

55
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.250
Grades.

56
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.630
Great.

57
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.630
Zimbabwe is the center, not the center of the second indicator.

58
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.920
We can just give a call or two.

59
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.130
It's.

60
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.480
You can't give a color of colours.

61
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.340
That's why.

62
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.190
Okay, great.

63
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:56.240
So if it is if it is true, then once we return to secular progressive, the kids are dead or house.

64
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.840
So we're going to use this nuts, which means house.

65
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.350
Right.

66
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.080
Once we turn that.

67
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.390
If you're just going to check.

68
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.220
What's going on?

69
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.430
Okay.

70
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.000
I think we need one additional parenthesis.

71
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.230
Okay.

72
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.170
Now we're going to use Contra and S to save.

73
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.220
Okay.

74
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.650
Now, what we simply did is we created a variable card based on this called loaded.

75
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.060
Then defaults, we set it to force.

76
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.440
The reason for this is so it will start loaded immediately.

77
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.470
We are in the register page.

78
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.610
So that was I will set it to force default then.

79
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.810
Also it is a type of bool that is supposedly true or false.

80
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.880
Value it over your first.

81
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.850
We said states where it is function is triggered.

82
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.110
Then we start loaded.

83
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.050
Then right then we are sitting at the chew.

84
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.290
So we start loading and after creating the accounts you can see it is in here.

85
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.260
After creating an account there wants to set it to force.

86
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.940
That is, want to stop loading?

87
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.250
It's okay.

88
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.370
Now I'm going to try this out.

89
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.610
Okay.

90
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.610
First of all, I'm going to pick an image from.

91
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.740
My gallery.

92
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.250
We can call this we can call this one name.

93
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.730
You're going to call this lot the.

94
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.460
Floods are okay.

95
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.750
They are just the way floods are.

96
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.070
She will dot come.

97
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.010
Then the password can be the.

98
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.820
Why is he okay?

99
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.610
They're going to click on the register.

100
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.900
Okay.

101
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.440
Great.

102
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.220
Great.

103
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.360
Now maybe it starts creating really crazy accounts.

104
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.470
This is going to start.

105
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.420
Okay, now I'm just going to check my time with this is what is going on there as well.

106
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.290
Okay.

107
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.040
Okay.

108
00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.800
Okay, okay.

109
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.960
I was in a very serious network issue, but I can see a network error and network issue.

110
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.550
And network issue.

111
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.480
Of course.

112
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.140
Right.

113
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.500
So you can see I'm loving a very loving network issue.

114
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.180
So let's see what else is going to work.

115
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.370
If you have a good network.

116
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.910
Okay, I'm going to try to do this again.

117
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.610
Okay.

118
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.130
Oh, I'm just going to leave this for you.

119
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.540
Okay,

120
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.890
great.

121
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.350
Great.

122
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.450
So I believe you understand the process bit by bit.

123
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.440
Probably.

124
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.530
I think we've got another error in the check, like a block or so if it's actually got created.

125
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.070
Okay.

126
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.020
You can see it was not created probably.

127
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.690
It's also popped out the network issue error.

128
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.380
Okay.

129
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.240
Okay, guys, see you.
