00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.050
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.440
In this lecture, we are going to build the category section over here.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.400
Okay, now, instead of this test, we can get rid of this and use a column widget in order to have

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.010
access to a lot of widgets.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.720
And now we can then use the children.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.870
Okay.

8
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.950
And the first chart of the column is going to be a test widget, which is going to say select.

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.220
Main category.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.160
I'm just going to use a small lighter.

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200
Or you can just go with a big litter.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.560
And over here, we need a comma.

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.150
Okay.

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.940
Use control and save and go check it out.

15
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.550
You can see select main category.

16
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.880
And now we are going to use this which you've not seen before.

17
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.730
It is known as dropdown.

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.830
Drop down.

19
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.489
Both in OC, you can see the dropdown button basically has two properties.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.250
That is the items and the change.

21
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
The items is basically referring to how many drop down item we want.

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.760
So instead of this, we can use a list of here.

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.300
Is a list and we can just break this to the next line and also break this to the next line.

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.870
And over here we can then say drop.

25
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.070
Drop down.

26
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.400
Dropdown menu item and you can see it has a property known as child, which is referring to the main

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.330
category name.

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.720
And for this it's going to be a test widget.

29
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.470
And we can then call this man.

30
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.120
It also has a property known as value, which is referring to the selected item.

31
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.600
And also we are going to call this man.

32
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.250
Okay.

33
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.490
And now what we can do is we can copy this.

34
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.350
And --.

35
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.520
It's maybe two more times.

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.600
Okay.

37
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.400
How did you come up with how to train a comer and how to turn a coma?

38
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.950
And we're going to change this to say women and for the value, it's going to be women and over year.

39
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.550
This is going to say shoes and.

40
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.180
She's okay.

41
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.530
And now you can see it also has the drop down button.

42
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.150
Hospital has a property known as On Change, which is a callback.

43
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.880
And I think you see something similar to this within the purchases we are going to pass in something

44
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:53.110
known as value, which is basically referring to the selected item and it is a function now use control

45
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.910
and has to save.

46
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.330
Okay.

47
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.680
And go check this out.

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.900
Look, you can see to it now click on this.

49
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.170
You can see we have the we have Siri drop down item.

50
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.810
We have the men, the women and the shoes.

51
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.240
Okay.

52
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.390
Now, what we also want to do is when we click on men, we want to be able to display it over here,

53
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.680
not to do this.

54
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.100
The drop down button has a property known as value.

55
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.060
And for this, what we can do is we can create a variable.

56
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.870
Over a year.

57
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.540
I'm just going to create this here.

58
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.660
And we are basically expecting a test.

59
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.370
So it's going to be a type of string and we're going to call this variable main category, main car

60
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.570
t go ri okay.

61
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.770
It's going to be equal to a default value of main.

62
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.690
Please note the default value must be within this.

63
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.160
High tech mobile rights must be within this item must be be the value one of these values.

64
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.830
Okay.

65
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.340
And now we are saying the default value is going to be this man over there.

66
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.720
Okay.

67
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.020
And men.

68
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.150
And the fire we need is semicolon.

69
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.329
Now click on this and for the value we're going to pass in the main category.

70
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.519
Okay.

71
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.829
Main category.

72
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.900
Okay.

73
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Use control and has to save now.

74
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.490
And you're going to see men over there.

75
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.390
You can see the default value is men.

76
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.540
And now what we want to do is when we click on women, we want to be able to set a switch from this

77
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.570
man to that women not to do that.

78
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.540
Remember, the drop down button has a property known as own change.

79
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.490
Right.

80
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.780
So what we have to do is we need to update the UI, right?

81
00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.310
Because we are basically changing the default value, which is men to another thing that is the selected

82
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.970
item.

83
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.210
To do that, we have to set state.

84
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.430
Said State.

85
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.030
And now we can say men category.

86
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.140
There's going to be the value by the value is basically referring to whatsoever the user is going to

87
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:27.880
select okay and now is basically asking us to specify the type of data we are expecting.

88
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.120
Most of the time you do not really need to specify the type of data you are expecting, but in this

89
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.750
case it's also specify the type of data we are expecting and you can see why this is a test.

90
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.740
So over here we can specify the type of value.

91
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.830
We can say it is a type of string.

92
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.660
And over here we could also say it can be no.

93
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.540
And over here, we need this check over here.

94
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.450
Okay.

95
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.000
Now we start this.

96
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.510
What is thing?

97
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.080
Or three.

98
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.310
Or.

99
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.060
We stepped in and now it's going to hold.

100
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.920
We start this screen or where we start and click on this.

101
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.490
Click on man.

102
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.820
And I can choose two women.

103
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.470
You can see women gets displayed over here.

104
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.720
And lastly, what we can also do.

105
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.990
You can see we can't see that test anymore.

106
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.190
Right.

107
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.740
And in order to solve this error, we can just have an if statement over.

108
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.700
Over.

109
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.350
Yeah.

110
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.430
So what we could do for now, we are going to call this off a light first and use concurrency to copy

111
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.480
to your clipboard.

112
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.520
And we are going to have a check.

113
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:56.260
The check is going to be there so we can say if image list dot is not empty.

114
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.670
If it is not empty.

115
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.840
While we need to check if it is not empty, then we want to do this.

116
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.320
Right.

117
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.150
Else if it is empty.

118
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.750
Then we want to return.

119
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.270
We turn.

120
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.920
What a center with that.

121
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.640
Okay.

122
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.050
We want to return this.

123
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.510
Okay.

124
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.110
Copy.

125
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.980
Click on this.

126
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:28.310
We can just use the centre widget jets first and as you know, the center with JET as a property known

127
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.210
as child.

128
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.130
And we can then piece this.

129
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.130
Hopefully no errors.

130
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.000
I think we have to get rid of one and use this most of the time.

131
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.980
You just have to hover in this to see what you're missing and you can see expected to find that.

132
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.690
So we have to have this.

133
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.290
Okay.

134
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.570
It's comprehensive now.

135
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.610
Look, you can see the difference since we have not picked any image, it's going to say you have not

136
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.250
picked any images yet.

137
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.890
And now we can click on this to see peak images.

138
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.490
Right.

139
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.770
And I think that is.

140
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.400
Or.

141
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.200
Okay.

142
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.210
You can see we have this images and click on it.

143
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.100
It's going to delete it.

144
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.790
Okay.

145
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.760
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
