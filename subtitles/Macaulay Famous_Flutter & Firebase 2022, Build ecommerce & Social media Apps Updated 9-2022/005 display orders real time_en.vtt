Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.160
Now, what we're going to do in this lecture is whenever a user orders of products, we are automatically

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.730
going to display that product in the order screen without having to refresh.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.330
Okay.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.810
Now, to do this ribbon around this this view that beta with something known as a future beta.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.870
So we that we, we are automatically going to call it that fetch orders over over the screen.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.290
Okay.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.360
So now to do this, what we can do is we can get rid of this for now.

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.670
Okay.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.500
It is over here, right?

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.690
Then we can use control and see to copy and then delete.

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.120
Okay.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.350
Now I'm going to wrap this with what a future view there.

Okay.

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.460
Now, the future bidder has a property known as future.

19
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.730
The future is going to be this variable order.

20
00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.290
Provider and then we're going to need to assess the French borders.

21
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.910
So we as well calling it yet.

22
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.810
Okay.

23
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.210
Now, this future border also has a property known as border.

24
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.750
Okay.

25
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.120
