00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.810
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.350
Welcome.

3
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.850
Now, only last lecture.

4
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.300
We created a function which we called peak image.

5
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.110
Also, we made a dynamic of our year.

6
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.600
We passed in source, the source of the maze on how we are going to take this image either from gallery

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.470
of a camera, which is also a type of image source.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.100
Then we created a variable called image or that's called image picker, which is equal to the image

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.360
of your car widget.

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.920
Okay.

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.040
Then after we said it is a type of image figure, right?

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.960
Then in another slide, we created a verbal code on this go in and I just saw the results before that.

13
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.150
Now we are making it dynamic, right?

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.710
So we have not passed in the location and that is how we are going to pick that image.

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.210
That is either from a camera or either from the gallery.

16
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.720
Okay.

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.280
Now, over here, we are checking if the user actually picked the image or not.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.430
We said if the user picked the image, then we want to be told how it's what is qualified.

19
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.510
Or tweet us about health that says the uses that does that being the image or refuses to take an image.

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.850
Then once a print the.

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.990
No message, no image selected.

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.330
Right.

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.890
Okay, now, for now, we are just pretending to ourselves.

24
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
Probably in the future we are going to present it to the user and not ourselves because we are not the

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.190
one making that error.

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.950
Okay, so now in this lecture, what we're going to do is we are going to call this.

27
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.590
Function.

28
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.040
Okay, now to do this, I'm going to go to our.

29
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.150
Or try to make you swallow it.

30
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.920
We're going to go to our side of screen.

31
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.360
Right.

32
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.880
Okay.

33
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.280
Keep control and B, to make this wider now.

34
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.760
Okay.

35
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.810
Now, this is the icon.

36
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.800
Okay.

37
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.890
This is the icon widget, right?

38
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.800
So what I'm going to do is one click on this.

39
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.980
It's going to trigger that function.

40
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.250
So what we're going to do is we are going to make this clickable.

41
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.260
So we're going to use control and dots.

42
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.940
We can rob this with a widget since the widget is not over.

43
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.550
This pop out a little click on Rupert's widgets, then I will wrap it with the widget node as well,

44
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.160
which is going to make the icons clickable.

45
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.680
Think.

46
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.390
Ink.

47
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.460
Well, okay, great.

48
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.490
Okay.

49
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.300
Just going to break this.

50
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.010
So the next night, they were going to have the they're going to have the.

51
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.870
On.

52
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.680
Top.

53
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.530
Okay.

54
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.020
Now, what you're gonna do is we're just going to create a function.

55
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.620
Over a year.

56
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.870
And you can call this function.

57
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.120
Okay.

58
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.400
We're just going to get rid of that.

59
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.050
You can call this function, select public here.

60
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.780
Okay, select image.

61
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.320
Okay.

62
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.460
So just copy this and they just want to create this.

63
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.310
The talk.

64
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.330
Okay.

65
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.720
Going doesn't create this.

66
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.270
Okay.

67
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.850
Okay.

68
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.660
Okay.

69
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.460
So is this.

70
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.130
Okay.

71
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.500
Now we are going to use the R word.

72
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.580
So first of all, over the past is saying, okay, now in order to have access to this.

73
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.950
That's how I was this big image.

74
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.680
We need to first have access to the class, which we call the control controller.

75
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.670
So.

76
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.600
Or via regular arts.

77
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.480
So what's.

78
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.260
But Controller, we need to call it a dot.

79
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.900
Peak image I can I can see is asking for the source because we made it dynamic.

80
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.280
So this is going to be.

81
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.940
Image.

82
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.709
Source then the gallery for now.

83
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.820
Okay, great.

84
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.640
Now what we can do is we can store the results.

85
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.360
That is the perfect image in a variable.

86
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.450
We can just call this the river card.

87
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.700
I am okay.

88
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.500
Which is the short form of image.

89
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.860
Right.

90
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.030
As well.

91
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.770
Now with this.

92
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.210
They can easily read more about async and how it's actually okay.

93
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.390
Now you're going to see the type of.

94
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.110
You.

95
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.280
You ain't.

96
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.870
It's.

97
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.730
So it's, I think.

98
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.500
You.

99
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.250
You.

100
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.950
It's okay.

101
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.340
It's okay.

102
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.050
I'm just going to do it for you.

103
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.250
So you going to see.

104
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.460
Okay.

105
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.930
Can't you?

106
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.250
Okay.

107
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.410
You can say to you, it's okay.

108
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.340
You okay?

109
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.030
Great.

110
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.940
Okay.

111
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:26.340
So okay, now what they're going to do is, first of all, they're going to set state.

112
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.660
Okay.

113
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.950
No, I don't think you can set stats because you're using less widgets.

114
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.380
So we kind of did the UI.

115
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.140
So what you're going to do covered this state for widget so that these are like for us, this country

116
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.890
red dots you're going to click on convert to state for widgets.

117
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.480
Okay, great.

118
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.700
Okay.

119
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.310
Now we can use the set states.

120
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.430
Okay, great.

121
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.110
Now, the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a global variable, and that variable

122
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.900
is going to store the current peeked image because the display is over.

123
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.430
Over you.

124
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.170
Okay.

125
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.420
So what we can do is we can just create.

126
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.320
It's here.

127
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.780
You know, just going to give some space.

128
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.950
Okay.

129
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.710
So we can call this on this call.

130
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.320
Image.

131
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:31.990
Okay, then we can see the type of you, ain't you, which is also a type of guy like you.

132
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.640
It's.

133
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.100
So is.

134
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.810
It's less.

135
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.180
So this is a type of I think we can just it can be.

136
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.570
No.

137
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.710
Okay.

138
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.840
Then how do you semi-colon.

139
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.620
Okay.

140
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.510
Now, over here.

141
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.630
We can call this global variable, which we call it, or the score.

142
00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:02.330
Image that we're going to see is equal to this variable which is holding the current image.

143
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.650
So this.

144
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.610
Okay.

145
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.410
So this is basically it.

146
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.910
I know I talked too much.

147
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.330
So that was I feel it is a very big deal, but really it's not really a big deal.

148
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.770
You can see that is just this line is just this line of code.

149
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:24.440
Then this line of code for the analyst is going to be very, very long because I talk too much and I'm

150
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.540
sorry for that.

151
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.490
Okay.

152
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.570
So now what you're going to do next is I'm going to try to display that image, that picked image.

153
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.490
Okay.

154
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.700
First of all, I didn't know how to start this first.

155
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.140
Just know about the status.

156
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.830
Okay.

157
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.220
Okay.

158
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.550
Okay.

159
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:43.920
Okay.

160
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.000
I think this is very chicken salad time.

161
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.020
Okay.

162
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.400
Just going to wait some bits.

163
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.720
Okay.

164
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.990
Okay.

165
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.490
Okay.

166
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:53.970
Okay.

167
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.340
Okay.

168
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.770
I think they should take us back to the log in first.

169
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.690
You're going to go to the sign up.

170
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.100
Okay.

171
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.700
Now.

172
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.110
Little click on this.

173
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.240
Okay.

174
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.780
Great.

175
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.420
Now it opens up our gallery.

176
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.300
So I gather you're just going to look now?

177
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:19.140
You can see currently we have no images on our emulator.

178
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.220
Okay.

179
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.560
Now what we can do is we can paste images over here so we can go to our files.

180
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.100
You can go to our files, search for that, I think.

181
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.300
Okay.

182
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.530
You can go to Dallas.

183
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:40.870
Then we can just copy this and use all of it on top.

184
00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.150
In to.

185
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.040
Okay.

186
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.510
We'll probably.

187
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.370
So we're going to do this again, I think.

188
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.310
Okay, there's no cost to this.

189
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.860
So we're going to use auto tab the.

190
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.140
Okay.

191
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.820
A little girl that we were going to paste this year.

192
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.780
Okay.

193
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.250
Great.

194
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.770
Mark is going to go check.

195
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:10.860
Okay.

196
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.170
Go back to it again.

197
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.370
Okay is now available.

198
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.420
They were able to click on it.

199
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.590
Okay, great.

200
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.350
So now what I'm going to do is display that pict image.

201
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:33.620
Okay, so to do this, first of all, in this circle of to what we can see is that the variable which

202
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.550
we call it is called.

203
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.400
Image.

204
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.700
I want to see if it's equal to.

205
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.050
No.

206
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.830
Who is equal to.

207
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.800
Let's think.

208
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.450
Okay.

209
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.520
If it is equal to now, then we want everyone to get treated.

210
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.860
First of all, we're just going to copy this.

211
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.860
Right.

212
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.460
So we're going to do the hair spots.

213
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.830
They're going to paste this.

214
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.060
Okay.

215
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.700
So now we are saying if the image is equal to.

216
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.230
So we can just see if it is not equal to that.

217
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.760
To this we have an image then instead of using the network.

218
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.410
The network.

219
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.320
It's obvious in a network image we're going to use the memory.

220
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.980
Memory image okay there little that global variable created, which we call this core image.

221
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.800
Okay.

222
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.190
They had our exclamation mark to say, we know that if we don't.

223
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.190
So what I simply say is if we have an image that is if image is not equal to non, which means we have

224
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.710
an image, then we want to display its health.

225
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.400
If we don't have an image, we just want to continue loading that into its image.

226
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.290
Okay, so now we're going to try to guess or to start this.

227
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.120
I think I talk too much.

228
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.020
Right.

229
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.740
Okay.

230
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.720
But just for you to try to get everything.

231
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.310
So that's why I'm talking so much.

232
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.820
Okay, so now I will click on this accord.

233
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.060
You see?

234
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.540
You can see currently we don't have the we don't have any picked image.

235
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.030
So it's when does this part of that?

236
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.650
Is the house okay.

237
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.060
So now what they're going to do is they're going to try to pick the image.

238
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.200
So we're going to pick this.

239
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.830
Okay, great.

240
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.710
Now you can see if a works so fine.

241
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.880
Right.

242
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.050
Okay.

243
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.080
Now, really, here is the most line of code for this.

244
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:55.710
Right.

245
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.040
There is really no more sense of could I just talk to much?

246
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.060
Okay.

247
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.180
Great.

248
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.680
So this is basically it.

249
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.190
So from the next lecture, I got to know that I saved this image to our.

250
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.730
Stories.

251
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:19.630
First, they're going to upload that picture to our Firebase database faster database.

252
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.040
Okay.

253
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.600
Okay, guys.

254
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.010
So in this lecture.
