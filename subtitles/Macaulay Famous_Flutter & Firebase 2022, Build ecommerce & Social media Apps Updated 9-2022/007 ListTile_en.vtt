00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.189
In this lecture, we're going to talk about lifestyle, but before then, after using constraints to

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.160
save, you're not going to see that box anymore.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:18.120
And the reason for this is because we are having this type of idea and it expect us to pass widgets

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.370
to this to children property.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.300
Okay.

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.940
And then also have the box back.

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.530
We have to then specify a width to this container default without having a child property is going to

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.870
take the width of this screen and that was why you were able to see that box.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.420
And since we then have a child, we then have to specify the width.

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.720
So for the width we can then say double.

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.680
Double dots infinity.

14
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.190
What this would do is it would take the entire width of our screen.

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.260
Now use control and save.

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.920
And it's going to take the entire width of our screen.

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.150
You can see.

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.220
The reason for this space is because we are basically wrapping everything up with a padding and for

19
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.210
all the sides, we made it ten picks.

20
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.960
Right.

21
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.970
So since we are going to be having children, what we can do is we can get rid of the sweet.

22
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.250
And then within this column, remember, the column can take multiple kids.

23
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.060
Right.

24
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.090
We are going to be using this widgets, which you've not seen before.

25
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.460
It is known as LIST.

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.190
It's high.

27
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.730
The list has a property known as title for the title.

28
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.010
It can be any type of widget.

29
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.450
It can even be a row widget.

30
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.930
But we are just going to use a test widget which is just going to say email.

31
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.130
Address.

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:05.950
Address and hide your true newcomer and use control and se to save and then go check it out.

33
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
You can see now the container is back because we are not having widgets.

34
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.260
Right.

35
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.810
Okay.

36
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.690
The site is going to be at the middle and the last time has a property known as subtitle, which is

37
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.500
going to be at the bottom of this title for the subtitle is going to be the user name address.

38
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.640
So we could then say my colleague, famous email.

39
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.010
Dot com.

40
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.090
Country.

41
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.110
Try to save.

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.860
You can see it below this.

43
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.510
Okay.

44
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.640
And then we can have an email icon over there.

45
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.270
To do that, the list has a property known as leading.

46
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.220
This is going to be an icon we get.

47
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.560
We can then say icons, dot, email.

48
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.940
And how did you newcomer use controller as the save and you're going to sit via okay so lithium is going

49
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:22.010
to be at the left side is going to be the center and subtitle is going to be at the bottom of the title.

50
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.270
The list time also to have a property known as trailing, which is going to be at the right side for

51
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.800
the trailer.

52
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.520
We can just say test, I'm just going to show you this, but we are not going to be using this.

53
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.540
Okay.

54
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.220
Maybe I'm just going to type something gibberish over here.

55
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.150
You're going to see it at the right side.

56
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.050
Okay.

57
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.930
So trailing is at the right.

58
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:53.750
Leading is are the left titles are the middle and the email address and the subtitle is the bottom of

59
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.320
the title.

60
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.130
Right.

61
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.220
Hopefully understand this.

62
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.840
Okay.

63
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.850
Is control necessary?

64
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.520
And now we're going to have another for the phone number and address.

65
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.980
So what we can do is we can have a divider or via.

66
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.840
Divider.

67
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.029
And the caller is going to be callers that send or sign any pro licenses and the thickness is going

68
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.870
to be one.

69
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.120
And how did you come here?

70
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.760
And then we could then copy this and paste this over here.

71
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.160
Okay.

72
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.600
Just gonna try next to save.

73
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.970
And go check it out.

74
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.830
You can see now and you can drop this iPad in.

75
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.020
So we know that container light and use control nodes, we can wrap this with a pardon.

76
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.020
Okay, maybe here it is.

77
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.380
Okay.

78
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.190
We can just check this out first.

79
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.910
To see.

80
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.410
Okay, I think this is okay.

81
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.530
And we have to rename this to.

82
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.700
To.

83
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.170
Phone and.

84
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.260
And.

85
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:15.540
My phone number is this 2348149 ten 6125.

86
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.330
Definitely you're going to hard close to this.

87
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.570
Okay.

88
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.770
Plus two, three, four.

89
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.880
I think this is my WhatsApp number and this country and save.

90
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.920
And you're going to see it via the OC.

91
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.970
And lastly, we could just copy everything over here.

92
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.290
That is both the pardon.

93
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.750
That is both divider and this.

94
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.300
And we're going to pay this over here year.

95
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.750
Okay.

96
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.590
This country needs to save and we have to rename this to.

97
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.550
High gas.

98
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.740
Address.

99
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.130
Okay.

100
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.900
And.

101
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.740
We're just going to say number one, my.

102
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.150
McIvor Street.

103
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.860
OC is a true newcomer Surrey country and is a safe.

104
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.610
And go check it out.

105
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.950
Okay.

106
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.840
You can see we do not have.

107
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.050
Page four.

108
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.800
So what we can do is we can just increase the.

109
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:26.060
The the heights may be too itchy and that to have.

110
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.470
Some additional space.

111
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.020
Okay.

112
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.670
Great.

113
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.840
Looking great, right?

114
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.950
Hopefully.

115
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.220
Okay.

116
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.430
So we have to change the icon.

117
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.590
So this is for email and.

118
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.080
This is for me, right?

119
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.020
And this is going to save phone.

120
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.520
Phone.

121
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.480
And.

122
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.590
For this address.

123
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.120
This is going to be.

124
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.790
Location.

125
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.990
On this score.

126
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.700
Okay.

127
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.740
Additional comment and you can try and save.

128
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.750
You can also change the color if you want.

129
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.630
You could just change the color.

130
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.980
Close the sea on.

131
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.800
Or sign.

132
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.930
And.

133
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.310
Color.

134
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.820
Cause the kind.

135
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.860
Or maybe yours could be pink or whatever.

136
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.530
And.

137
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.390
Okay.

138
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.750
Maybe that is okay.

139
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.690
These controls to save.

140
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.090
Okay.

141
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.640
I think we should do it for that as well.

142
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.330
Okay.

143
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.620
Scholar Studs.

144
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.950
See.

145
00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:00.710
And lastly, what we can do is we can change this color, the active color to be designed.

146
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.840
Like you to do that, we have to go to where the customer screened, hopefully.

147
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:07.870
Okay.

148
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:15.990
For the on selected color, it's not going to be black, but the sign and for the selected item, you're

149
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.300
going to make this black.

150
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:24.300
Okay, so every selected item is going to take the color of black, then the default on selected item

151
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.470
is going to be signed.

152
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.840
Like you can see now.

153
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.890
Sounds good, right?

154
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.500
Okay.

155
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.549
We are not yet able to scroll.

156
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.360
Okay.

157
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.330
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
