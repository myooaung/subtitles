00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.290
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.900
Walk on in this lecture.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.120
We are going to have budgets to our products not to do this.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:18.120
Head up to your browser and then pop dot dev and over here we are going to search for badges.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.260
Badges.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.830
Okay.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.270
And.

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.480
Okay.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.340
So a little bit delay.

10
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.900
Okay.

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.080
And now we have to click on this first link of that is the badges.

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:41.990
And the next step is to copy this code and head back to your voice code and the post back that your

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.260
modify and you have to paste this over here and use controller and you saved and you can see currently

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.130
I already had this in mind.

15
00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.800
Okay, now back to what we simply want to do is we want to have badges on top of each of our products.

16
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.580
To do this, we have to go to the design for each product.

17
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.540
And I think we have that file in the widgets, dietary the widgets.

18
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.420
Widgets, widgets and then products on the score model.

19
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.550
And what we can do first is to use control and B to make this wide.

20
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.450
Okay.

21
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.530
Now, over here, we are basically having a pardon in order to give spaces in all the hedges that is

22
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.820
top left right and bottom right.

23
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.460
Okay.

24
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.320
And within the pattern, we have this child, which is a container, and the container has the column.

25
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.920
And basically, this is for this container is basically to display the the product's image and as well

26
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.930
the products, the product's name.

27
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.620
Right.

28
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.120
So what we can then do, we can place the batch on top of this product that is over here.

29
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.300
And that's a place widget on top widget.

30
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.370
We are going to be using the widget known as Stack.

31
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.950
Basically, everything floater is referred to as a widget, right?

32
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.500
Like I said, in order to place widgets on 12 widgets, we are going to be using what is stock widgets.

33
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.110
Okay.

34
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.290
Sylvia we can alight.

35
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.390
This container is contained dots.

36
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.710
And since we do not have that stack property where the stack is very similar to that of the column,

37
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.470
so we can wrap this first with a column.

38
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
It's a column and we can then rename this to Stack.

39
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.200
Okay.

40
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.310
Great.

41
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.530
And now.

42
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:05.230
After this container removal, we can just see this container as the container that displays our products

43
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.710
image and the price and order sense of it.

44
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.640
Right.

45
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.830
And we want to place this on top of this.

46
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.420
So right after the container, you have to have your training.

47
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.220
If you do not have it there.

48
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.260
And what you have to do now is to head back to your browser and scroll down and you can see why we have

49
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.950
this badge copied from this path.

50
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.950
So this path is contained C to copy and we are going to paste this right after.

51
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.900
The container and we have to import.

52
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.430
Now I use control and ask to save.

53
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.610
And you're going to see a badge on top of this now.

54
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.420
All right.

55
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.500
Okay.

56
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.030
Sims, cool.

57
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.370
Right.

58
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.000
Okay.

59
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.220
And now in order to tell.

60
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.930
The badge, how we want to place it, how we want to place it.

61
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.110
We are going to be using a widget known as position.

62
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.460
So over here, a light in this contract puts widgets.

63
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.440
And we are going to wrap this with.

64
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:21.950
Call the session and now the position has a property known as left.

65
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.090
And for the left we can say we want it to go ten from the left and also we want it to go.

66
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.700
Ten from the top.

67
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.930
Okay, great.

68
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.870
So what we are basically doing is we are telling the badge how it's going to display itself.

69
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.690
It's going to try to save now and go use go check it out.

70
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.080
Okay.

71
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.390
You can see some school and.

72
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.420
You can see where we have we have this patch content, which is basically referring to the tests which

73
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.260
you have seen here.

74
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.920
Right.

75
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:10.430
So what we can then do is we can change this test to say new driver or us use control and hence now

76
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.150
to save.

77
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.910
And let's check it out.

78
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.180
Okay.

79
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.660
New arrivals and what we can also do.

80
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.290
The barge has a property known as to animate.

81
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.610
So what we can do?

82
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.740
We can say, yes, we want animation to do that.

83
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.810
Or we just have to say is to set it to true.

84
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.840
Use control and save and.

85
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.980
Go to this and come back to this.

86
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.540
You can see that animation over there.

87
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.100
Okay.

88
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:52.190
And you can see as well, the badge has a property known as badge color.

89
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.540
And currently it sets the colors, the deep blue.

90
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.840
So what we can do is we can see colors that sign.

91
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.650
Or whatsoever color you want.

92
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.250
Okay.

93
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.320
Okay.

94
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.340
Sims Very cool.

95
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.500
Okay.

96
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.800
And click on this.

97
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.860
Okay.

98
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.120
Sounds good.

99
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.400
And if you can screw this away, you could also just get rid of that single child single child curfew.

100
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.050
Okay.

101
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.350
Walking as a spectator.

102
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.910
Right.

103
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.250
And let's go check the store.

104
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.310
So.

105
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.110
Go back.

106
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.090
Sorry, sir.

107
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.630
Okay.

108
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.370
Everything is working out as expected.

109
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.130
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
