00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.150
Our guys welcome in this section.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.840
We're going to create this search functionality.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.950
Okay, then let us do this.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.540
We need to go to our screens directory and over here are going to need to create a new file and we are

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.140
going to call this file search on this screen and the section Dodge Dart.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.890
And now we can use control and beats and make this work.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.920
And we can't just use this fitness widget.

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410
And since we can change it later.

9
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.740
Okay.

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.290
As well.

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.900
We can call this search screen.

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.580
And over here we need to highlight and then use control and dots in order to impart the materia to that

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.120
package.

14
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.600
Okay.

15
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.660
Now I know that you have access to lots more property.

16
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.250
We can get rid of this container and then use a scaffold widget scaffold.

17
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.400
Okay.

18
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.830
Now, as in all this cow, Ford has a property which is known as Aber, and we can, as you say, Harbour.

19
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.760
Burr.

20
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.070
And as you know, discovered sorry, the harbor has a property known as broker caller and for the broker

21
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.150
caller we can say caller is Dutch read okay.

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.970
Now all we can do is use control and has to save and use control and b to make this smaller.

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.720
Then we're going to go to the cost to that fly.

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.030
And is it not this search?

25
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.860
We're going to get rid of this search there and then use this search.

26
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.730
Says Korin.

27
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.780
We just created.

28
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.400
Search screen.

29
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.000
Okay.

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.750
Great.

31
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.150
I had yet to come over here.

32
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.840
Okay.

33
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.900
I think we need to highlight and use concurrent dots in order to import it here.

34
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.930
What we can simply do now is to highlight three stages.

35
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.880
Okay.

36
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.370
Well is already starting.

37
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.830
We can go back to the search for this screen.

38
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.720
Like you said, and silkscreen and wire.

39
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.670
Within the harbour.

40
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.100
As you know, the harbour has a property known as tie two for the tie two is going to be a search field

41
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.350
or a field where you're going to be able to switch.

42
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.790
Right.

43
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.210
Okay.

44
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.890
So all we can do, we can use a property known as test field or we can just go with test form field

45
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.770
in order to have access to some additional properties.

46
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.970
Okay.

47
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.570
Great.

48
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.620
Now we can have the decoration and imputes.

49
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.900
Imputes decoration.

50
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.600
Okay.

51
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.920
Right.

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.620
As all we can see field to for us, we don't want any gray air because if we said it, the tree is going

53
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.210
to give us a color of gray.

54
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.330
If.

55
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.840
Okay.

56
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.390
First.

57
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.950
Sorry.

58
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.440
Okay.

59
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.010
Great.

60
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.100
Now as well.

61
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.890
We can't have the test.

62
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.540
And for the intellect, we can't say search has a chain of command and we can have in Thai.

63
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.570
That's what's inside is --.

64
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.530
Okay.

65
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.220
There's going to be test tie.

66
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.980
Okay.

67
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.750
We can say font size.

68
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.580
Font size to lighting and fonts.

69
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.010
Weitz.

70
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.770
Font with.

71
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.570
We don't want to be without both.

72
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.980
So you can see fun tweets.

73
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.550
It's going to be dark.

74
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.390
W.

75
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.880
TV hundred or.

76
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.700
I would really soak in hydrogen and use culture and has to save.

77
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.080
Okay.

78
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.960
And.

79
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.400
Okay.

80
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.070
I think you've seen all this before, right?

81
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.570
Okay.

82
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.480
And we can't click on the search.

83
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.980
Okay.

84
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.150
You can see over here, you can see we have this line.

85
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.010
Right.

86
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.950
I think all we can do is.

87
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.080
We can as well give a color to this again, say color and colors the white.

88
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.180
Okay.

89
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.720
And what we can also do is a will come color of at least contribute an associate and go check us out.

90
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.810
Okay.

91
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.900
I think this is cool.

92
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.140
But you can have any other color you so desire.

93
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.680
Okay.

94
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.420
Okay, guys.

95
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.190
See you in the next lecture.

96
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.870
So let's see you in the next lecture yet, because I do have a body weight.

97
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.590
So we can as we have a body which is found within the scaffold and we can have a center widget.

98
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.230
Okay.

99
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.060
And.

100
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.260
A child.

101
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.660
And which is just going to say search users for now.

102
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.100
Okay.

103
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.110
As well.

104
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.150
We can tie this and test tie.

105
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.920
And you can see font.

106
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.980
Size 22 and font.

107
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.100
Or it's.

108
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.820
Okay.

109
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.080
Fine.

110
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.870
We follow.

111
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.770
We finally.

112
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.820
Okay.

113
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.690
It's going to be fine.

114
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.040
We.

115
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.310
Okay.

116
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.790
Sorry.

117
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.050
Font which.

118
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.680
Find out which.

119
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.630
A kind of like a spill with that boat.

120
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.230
Okay.

121
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.830
I just feel a comma and use control, and that's the save.

122
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.810
And you can see it over here.

123
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.960
Okay, great.

124
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.590
I think this is way too big.

125
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.810
We can just say 20 or and use country and s to save.

126
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.710
Okay.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.480
Okay.

128
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.870
Now, finally.

129
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.110
So you're in the next lecture.
