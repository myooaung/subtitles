00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.790
Now we're going to have three icons over here and they are going to be displayed horizontally, that

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.720
is from left to right.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.220
But since we're going to be breaking this lecture into pieces and order to make sure we understand what

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
we are doing, we are going to first have a container in this lecture.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.630
Nine.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.120
In order to do this, we're going to need to go back to our VTS code and the profile screen and what

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.690
we can do.

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.280
We can use control and beads to make this wide OC and we can just have the train come out here to know

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.460
where, how this ends and how via.

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.420
Okay.

13
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.140
Great.

14
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.980
Now, in order to had widgets to this main body.

15
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.310
We're going to need to come out from the harbor.

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.940
And within the coastal scroll view.

17
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.910
It has a property which is known as silver.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.440
See over to box adapter.

19
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.640
Okay.

20
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.130
And in this main body, we are going to have lots of widgets and they're going to be displayed vertically.

21
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.730
Right.

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.310
That is from top to bottom.

23
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.660
Now, I would send the Seaver to box adapter.

24
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.000
It has the child and the child is going to be a column widget in order to accept multiple widgets.

25
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.270
And as you know, the column can take multiple widgets or children.

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.750
So it adds this children property and the first child.

27
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.950
Is going to be a container.

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.240
We can give this container a height of 80.

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.130
That is how long the container is going to be.

30
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.570
And we can give this container a width.

31
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.140
That is how wide it's going to be for the width.

32
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.990
We are going to get the width of our screen.

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.430
To do that, we have to say media query dots of context, then the size, dots, width.

34
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.130
And we can just say we want 90%.

35
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.410
We want to tighten by 0 to 9.

36
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.740
Okay.

37
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.460
Great.

38
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.560
And in order to have access to loss of property, the container has.

39
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.040
We can then have a declaration and a box.

40
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.530
Decoration.

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.160
And they're going to say, caller, this is going to be callers that.

42
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.670
Right now is control and safe.

43
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.220
You're not going to see this.

44
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.820
And the reason for this is because the scaffold has a color of white.

45
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.880
So what we have to do within the scaffold, we can change the background color.

46
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.060
We can then say we want it to be colors that gray.

47
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.150
And we can give some little shade to this by saying shade tree red and you can try and save now.

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.560
You can see the wire and we can make this a bit rounded.

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.840
You can see it has 90%.

50
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.600
Okay.

51
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.300
So what's in the box?

52
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.230
Decoration.

53
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.760
It has a property which is known as border radius.

54
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.430
And this is going to be border radius.

55
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.340
But to reduce Dot's circular, we can give this 50 to make it more rounded.

56
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.530
Okay.

57
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.150
Okay.

58
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.600
Great.

59
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.860
Okay.

60
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.870
We're just going to stop here.

61
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.460
We're going to be doing this bit by bit in order for you to understand.

62
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:49.300
Now, like I said, in order to have a widget displayed over this main body, we had to use something

63
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.180
known as silver to box adapter.

64
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.610
And basically all our widgets are going to be displayed vertically.

65
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.130
Right inside this container.

66
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
We can add the row, which is going to be displayed horizontally.

67
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.870
That is over here, over and over here.

68
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.090
But in general, all our widgets are going to be displayed vertically because we are still going to

69
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.800
have widgets here, widgets here, widgets here and over here as well.

70
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.110
So that was why we have to wrap the entire widget with a column.

71
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.350
And the first side of the column is a container and we're basically giving it a height.

72
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.180
That is how long it's going to be.

73
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.710
That is from here to here.

74
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.900
And we are also giving it a width that is how wide is going to be.

75
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.850
And we say we want to get the width of the screen and times it by 90%.

76
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.920
That is 90% of our screen.

77
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.390
So you can see over there.

78
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.200
And this is going to be way too straight.

79
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.960
So what we did in order to have access to lots more property, that is the property more of the property

80
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.670
the container has we had a declaration which sent the box declaration and the first thing was to make

81
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.380
the colour white.

82
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.770
But unfortunately, the scaffold has a background of white, so we definitely not going to be able to

83
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.790
see that white.

84
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.830
So what we did was to have.

85
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:25.130
The scaffold background colour changed to grey and we given a shade of 300 OC and also we have a border

86
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.910
radius of border radius that 50 years can be 25.

87
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.140
You don't really need to go with my home design.

88
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.850
You can have your OC.

89
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.130
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
