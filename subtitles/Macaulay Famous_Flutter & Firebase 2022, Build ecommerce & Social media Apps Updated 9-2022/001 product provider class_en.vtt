00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:09.060
Worker No, you can see we are able to display these two products over the free screen and if we desire

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.240
to display this two products over the whole screen, we are going to need to follow the same as that

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.530
process we use in displaying this two products over the screen.

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.120
Right.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.190
And which I think is going to be a very bad design.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.600
Okay.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.600
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to create a fly.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.470
And in that fly, rebel have our products.

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.850
Then we are going to share that product to the rest of the fly.

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.950
That is, we are going to be able to access that product in any of these pages.

12
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.360
Okay.

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.780
Now, to do that, I'm going to introduce you to something known as status management provider.

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.290
Okay.

15
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.860
Now, what we're going to do is over this deep directory, they're going to create a new folder and

16
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.900
they're going to call this folder pro y provider.

17
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.710
Then over this provider after they're going to create a new FY.

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.650
And Roberto called his FY products.

19
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.010
Products with X products.

20
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.800
That's that's okay.

21
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.260
Great.

22
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.390
They're not going to be used in the provider package.

23
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.030
If for any reason you don't have it in your prospect, it's YAML.

24
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:30.290
You can go to your job, the their provider and you can see we have it there.

25
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.330
You're going to need to add it.

26
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.720
Okay.

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.120
Great.

28
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.830
Now you're going to go back to the products that that okay we can then use control to be.

29
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.250
Okay.

30
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.530
Now, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a class and similar call this class

31
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.460
products.

32
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.170
Then rebels say, wait, change, that's a fire.

33
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.260
What this will simply do is anytime we update the products listed for that change that's going to this

34
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.430
is for the change we are making to that products.

35
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.810
Okay.

36
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.400
So now what we're going to do, everything is controlled.

37
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.970
B now then.

38
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.740
We are to go to the bleep.

39
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.480
Right.

40
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.880
Okay.

41
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.430
Then the views.

42
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.440
Is where we have our viewers.

43
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.350
Screens there are going to need to go to the fields screen.

44
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.470
Now for dinner theater property.

45
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.310
Now, we can't just copy it, so we don't have.

46
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.540
So there's.

47
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.670
Okay, just copy this.

48
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.140
It's NC, right?

49
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.490
Okay.

50
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.440
Just copy quality this all from you since you're going to make the products available in all the pages.

51
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.790
Okay.

52
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.630
So now what they're going to do is a little pasted over here.

53
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.440
Yeah.

54
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.550
When you saw a light.

55
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.740
And so that's what come out what's called true.

56
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.760
And that's the problem.

57
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.030
They say, of course, the models look great.

58
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.820
Now kids contribute to look this way.

59
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.700
Now, what we're going to do is before this.

60
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.470
We are going to say this is a type of list.

61
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.820
Right.

62
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.760
Then the production model, that's it.

63
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.680
We called it products and not products.

64
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.890
The products is this class, right.

65
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.840
So we're importing the products model.

66
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.000
Okay.

67
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.340
Now that is the type of protests that we can see get protests.

68
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.250
That's what drives us to that model.

69
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.760
It feels like.

70
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.470
Great.

71
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.530
There is this.

72
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.470
Then it's on.

73
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.220
This variable could put us to.

74
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.890
On the score for us.

75
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.240
Okay, great.

76
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.360
So what we're basically doing is we are transferring all the guitars we have.

77
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.400
Over here to this rebel court put up so you can just adheres to this product's okay.

78
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.810
If there is any kind of assess to this, you can either use this wreckage because it is a list you can

79
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.290
then use dot, dot, dot, then underscore products that's in the lockouts as well.

80
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.320
Okay.

81
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.000
What is that?

82
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.140
I did not.

83
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.540
Okay for the score, cadets.

84
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.620
Okay.

85
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.740
Great.

86
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.330
Or probably you're going to do it this way.

87
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.020
Okay.

88
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.850
It did not work out.

89
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.070
So that only relates where they specify that it is a type of lease.

90
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.630
So there's no need for that.

91
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.960
Okay.

92
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.900
We're just trying to show you more ways you could do it, but really we already specifying that it is

93
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.900
the right.

94
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.300
Okay.

95
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.820
Now, the next thing we're going to do is what we agreed that we're going to do is we're going to make

96
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.860
this product available within all our pages.

97
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.790
We can even make it available in the search cart upload and the profile that is everywhere within the

98
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.250
app.

99
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.960
Now, to do this this controversy.

100
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.210
First of all, contract is safe.

101
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.420
Like I said before, it is listed for any change we are making to this product in the future.

102
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.480
We are going to use our base and not this product.

103
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.130
So the problem.

104
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.700
Right, is going to be coming from the firebase.

105
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.580
So we need to add this change that you fire.

106
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.610
So any time we make an object, that product is going to a sensor, it's okay.

107
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.450
So now to make this available in all our files.

108
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.480
So what we're going to need to do is go to the main tool that fly main, dot, dot.

109
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.350
And we can't use.

110
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.950
Gotta be very smart to have these red dots.

111
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.470
Now, we don't have the widget.

112
00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:02.690
And when we are going to use contract with widgets locally, something known as multi multi provider

113
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:11.540
that is going to be here because in this is property as provide us okay for the providers what they

114
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.780
are going to do is we are going to say change.

115
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.990
Change.

116
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.150
Notify a provider.

117
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.530
Then create.

118
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.060
Then the next thing they're going to do, they're just going to leave this empty.

119
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.480
They're passing this, underscore their return to our reflection.

120
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.080
Then we're going to call that product.

121
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.060
Products.

122
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.990
For that.

123
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.260
I think we call it products.

124
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.670
Okay, great.

125
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.680
So it is basically it's this content is to say, okay, now we have access to.

126
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.720
All the data within that product supply.

127
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.070
Okay.

128
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.110
Then in this picture, we're going to be able to display that product we have there.

129
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.920
Okay, guys, see you in this picture.
