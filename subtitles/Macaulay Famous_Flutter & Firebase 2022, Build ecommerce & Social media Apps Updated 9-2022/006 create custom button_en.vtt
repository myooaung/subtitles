00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.180
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.770
Walker In this lecture, we're going to create a button, and we're going to make this button visible,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.130
okay?

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.890
Not to do this over this crazy territory.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.140
We're going to create a new folder, and we're going to call this folder widgets.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.620
Okay.

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.920
Then over this widget directory, we're going to create a new PHI and we're going to call this fly custom

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.880
on the score box and then the section, dots, dots.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.780
Okay, now we can just go ahead with the stateless widget since nothing's going to change or since we

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.320
are not going to update the UI.

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.740
Okay.

12
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.690
So you can either call this custom button.

13
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.590
Then over here we need to add lights and then use controller and dots in a note to import the material

14
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.670
that that package.

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.030
Okay.

16
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.480
Now is yellow for it's on a container regular.

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.920
It's on an elevated button, which is a type of button.

18
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.780
Okay.

19
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.160
Elevated.

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.840
Elevator button.

21
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.260
Okay.

22
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.900
Now, this elevated button has a property known as OM Press, which is a function.

23
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.340
Okay.

24
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.540
And as well it has the child property.

25
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.940
Okay.

26
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.670
Now for the child is going to be a test which acts.

27
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.460
And like I said, we're going to make this button reusable.

28
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880
So all we can do is we can create a reusable test.

29
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.270
Okay.

30
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.460
So over here we can say fine and string, right?

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.390
Then this is going to be test.

32
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.860
Okay.

33
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.850
Now, the next thing to do is to pass it on to the constructor.

34
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.130
So any time we call this custom passing, we're gonna need to pass in the value.

35
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.850
Okay, so all we can do is use red dots, then create constructor.

36
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.750
We'll find our fields.

37
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.080
Okay.

38
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.160
Now, we can easily just say we don't want it to be required.

39
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.270
Right.

40
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.020
So any time we call in, we call this custom button.

41
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.440
We don't really need to pass in the value to this test.

42
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.550
So what we can do is we can say we want it to be required by pass in a pass in the required keyword

43
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.120
over here.

44
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.510
Okay.

45
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.290
Nice.

46
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.139
Out of this, we can pass in the test.

47
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.640
Okay, great.

48
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.760
Now we can use country.

49
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.480
And that's to say, okay, now over this logging screen, what we can do is we can make this button

50
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
we just created we just created the test widget.

51
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.030
So we can call the custom.

52
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.800
Cost.

53
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.420
But saying, okay, now you can see we made that required so it is better to pass the value to that

54
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.820
test.

55
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.200
Okay.

56
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.840
For the value, we can just say log in.

57
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.740
Okay.

58
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.870
This content is to save and check what you just did given the state of our year.

59
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.550
Okay, great.

60
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.950
Now we can give some tie to this.

61
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.420
Okay.

62
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.040
Okay.

63
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.720
Sorry.

64
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.300
Huston But now, as you know, this test has a property known as Ty, and we can see it says Ty.

65
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.610
We can just set your font size.

66
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.910
Sorry, Steve.

67
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.690
4717 is okay.

68
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.080
Okay.

69
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.690
Great.

70
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.290
Okay.

71
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.740
Now check.

72
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.060
Now, all we can do is we can tie this button.

73
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.490
Okay.

74
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.230
Now you can do it over here.

75
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.770
This elevated button, that is the property known as tie.

76
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.030
You can do it over here or we can as well do it over here, but must be within the elevated button.

77
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.120
Okay, so you can just do it over here.

78
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.880
Okay.

79
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.290
Stay right.

80
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.930
And this is going to be elevated.

81
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.900
But in that timeframe, which means we want to stay this way.

82
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.590
Okay.

83
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.650
Now, this has a property known as primary for the primary.

84
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.030
It means we want to change the background colour of this button.

85
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.480
Okay.

86
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.300
So now what we can do is we can use the button colour which we have in the colours.

87
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.650
Okay.

88
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.080
Use country and save.

89
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.930
Okay.

90
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.210
I think we just have to pass the studies.

91
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.040
Okay.

92
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.709
Now, all we can assert is we can make this a bit bigger.

93
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.430
A bit bigger.

94
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.880
Okay.

95
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:33.350
Now to do this within the elevated but so within this elevated bartender's diaphragm, it has a property

96
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.850
known as minimum.

97
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.400
Minimum, I think not maximum, but minimum size.

98
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.270
And we can see size.

99
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.450
Size.

100
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.910
Okay.

101
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.670
Like I is asking for the weight though it simply miss how wide the button is going to be and the ice

102
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.880
simply means how long the buttons would be.

103
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.170
Okay for the weights.

104
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.370
We can say double.

105
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.360
Double.

106
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.480
Towards infinity.

107
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.540
What this would do is it would take the available space.

108
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.990
Okay.

109
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.470
So that's from year to year.

110
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.860
Okay.

111
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.620
So now for the height, what we can do is we can just give the height of what's sorry 50 and now we

112
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.370
can use control.

113
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.780
And that's the save and.

114
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.020
Okay.

115
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.650
You can see.

116
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.240
Okay there they can see is way too wide.

117
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.950
So we can give you part into this.

118
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.050
So you can see.

119
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.710
Pardon?

120
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.700
We can just so we can rob this with the father.

121
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.250
Sorry.

122
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.630
Okay.

123
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.680
And for all sides, we can say it's in.

124
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.730
Okay.

125
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.560
Okay.

126
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.190
Great.

127
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.010
Okay.

128
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.010
Now all we can do is add the trauma coma via a nasal.

129
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.540
This elevated button does tie from has a property.

130
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.200
Has it property.

131
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.420
No one has shipped.

132
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.600
Okay for the ship.

133
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.250
This is going to be around rounded.

134
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.100
Rounded rectangle border.

135
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.260
So what we want to do is we want to give this a beats rounded shape.

136
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.660
Okay, and layer.

137
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.650
We can see what I would use and can see border.

138
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.530
Reduce.

139
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.440
That's circular of 30.

140
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.660
The key agitation, coma and.

141
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.620
Okay.

142
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.100
You can see.

143
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.740
Great.

144
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.310
Okay.

145
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.110
Now, what we can do is we can give a pattern between this and this.

146
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.930
So to take this image, it beats to the bottom from this test.

147
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.920
Okay, not to do that, you're going to need to go to the log in screen.

148
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.280
And over here we can rob this with a paddle.

149
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.770
Pardon?

150
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.600
And is it of this?

151
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.730
It's not give you a pardon for all sides.

152
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.380
We can't say does.

153
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.400
Symmetric.

154
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.080
That is, we only want to give for the horizontal and vertical.

155
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.080
So for the now we can just give only for the vertical whereby vertical are asked to do it.

156
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.040
Top and bottom.

157
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.330
Right.

158
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.120
We can just see.

159
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.950
Probably 15 and see.

160
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.260
Okay.

161
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.490
Everything is country initiative.

162
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.170
So this is going to go all the way to the bottom.

163
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.830
Okay.

164
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.340
You can see.

165
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.040
Okay.

166
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.880
Okay.

167
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.680
Okay.

168
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.760
I think this is okay.

169
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.240
Okay.

170
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.670
Okay, guys.

171
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.180
See you in the next picture.
