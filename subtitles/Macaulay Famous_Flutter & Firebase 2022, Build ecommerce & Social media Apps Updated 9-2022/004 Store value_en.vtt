1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.230
I walk.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.790
In this lecture, we are going to grab the inputs of the user.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.410
To do this, the test form field has a property known as unchanged.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.840
Okay.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.510
So we tend to test on field.

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.110
And over here it has a property known as on change.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.810
And we need a parenthesis over it because it is a callback or a function.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.369
And within the parentheses, we have to pass something known as value.

9
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.040
And the value is basically referring to whatsoever.

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.610
User is going to type in here.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.040
So the current value is F, f or g.

12
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.250
Okay.

13
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.560
And for this, we have to specify the type of value we are expecting.

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.940
You can see it is expecting, it says.

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.410
So it is a data type of string.

16
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.450
Now what we can do, we can create a variable to store the value.

17
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.340
To do that over here.

18
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.160
Over a year, we are going to create a variable and we are going to specify the type first.

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.280
It is a type of late and the reason for this late is because we do not want to assign any value to it

20
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.690
at this point.

21
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.320
So it is also a type of string and we can then call this full name.

22
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.810
So you can see we are saying that it is a type of lead and the reason for this late we do not want to

23
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.370
assign any value to it.

24
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.630
So we are basically saying we are going to come home late or I'm going to hit later.

25
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.190
Okay.

26
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.640
And late string and email and late string.

27
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.320
And what password?

28
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.890
Okay.

29
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.430
And now all we have to do is.

30
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.050
The OC.

31
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.940
Over the on change.

32
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.350
One change we then have to say full name.

33
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.970
Is equal to what is equal to.

34
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.979
Value.

35
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.230
Okay.

36
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.510
And we can basically just copy this.

37
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.930
And do it for the email.

38
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.080
It's in the vat within the telephone field and pace this.

39
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.440
This is going to be what?

40
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.070
Email.

41
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.440
And lastly, for the password, it's in the test form field.

42
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.670
And all right, here, this is going to be password.

43
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.820
Okay, great.

44
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.550
And now we have successfully store the data that is going to go in here.

45
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.500
See that's available called password, which we created above.

46
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.900
And you can see now we are assigning value to it unlike before.

47
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.460
So that was why we have to use the latest keyword.

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.020
Okay.

49
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.080
And now what we have to do is where we have the.

50
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.840
The the.

51
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.040
Okay.

52
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.910
You can see why we said if form key the current state is validated.

53
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.450
If it is if it is valid, then what we can just do?

54
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.840
We can print.

55
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.200
Full name.

56
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.710
But it's okay to cancel and print email.

57
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.850
And Prince.

58
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.760
Maybe the password.

59
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.480
Okay.

60
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.250
Is Katrina safe?

61
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.810
And what we have to do is to open our.

62
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.170
Our seminar.

63
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.150
Okay.

64
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.930
CONCHA And.

65
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.660
Yes.

66
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.280
A new seminar.

67
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.250
Okay.

68
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.990
Hopefully he's not stuck.

69
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.880
So for the delay.

70
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.780
Okay.

71
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.620
New me and this over.

72
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.399
And.

73
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.279
Type is something.

74
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.220
What we can just do.

75
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.000
Okay.

76
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.220
We can also start this.

77
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.190
But we started and it's going to take some time because I'm just doing it for some time now and.

78
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.720
Definitely we are able to try this out.

79
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.270
We are able to try this out.

80
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.180
Okay.

81
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.560
Still to start, then.

82
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.740
Okay.

83
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.900
If I'm in Auschwitz, that's.

84
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.680
Sorry for the delay.

85
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.490
I'm deeply sorry for the delay.

86
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.240
I think this is taking longer than expected.

87
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.090
Probably I'm just going to do it of this.

88
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.560
I'm just going to do it behind the scene and.

89
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.220
Okay.

90
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.230
Before we start.

91
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.800
And.

92
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.760
Look, it's going to hurt to start this up now.

93
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.770
So I'm very, very sorry for the delay.

94
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.060
Okay.

95
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.960
Well, we start.

96
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.950
Okay.

97
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.820
We can then navigate to the sign up.

98
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.230
And he's asking for the full name.

99
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.530
I can just type famous and.

100
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.550
Site famous and password is famous and it is currently valid.

101
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.120
Right.

102
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.790
So we should get our data via OC.

103
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.710
You can see it is currently valid.

104
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.020
This is going to run right.

105
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.110
As if it is not valid.

106
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.170
This is going to run.

107
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.980
Okay.

108
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.100
What about getting rid of this famous and trying to run?

109
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.850
You can see.

110
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.920
Sounds good, right?

111
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.530
Okay, let's do the right thing.

112
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.630
Okay.

113
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.580
F.

114
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.320
F.

115
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.230
Okay.

116
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.900
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
