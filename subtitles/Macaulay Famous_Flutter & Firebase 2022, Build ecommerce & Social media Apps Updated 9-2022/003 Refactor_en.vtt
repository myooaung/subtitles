Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.939
In this lecture, we're going to make our code more concise.

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.600
Okay?

5
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:14.880
Now, what we can do is you can see we have over four tabs over here and they look very much similar.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.810
So what we are going to do is we can extract this.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.330
To do that we need to alight and use control dots and extract widgets and it's asking for the name.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.610
We are going to call this repeated mixture.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.330
It is a capital letter because it's going to be a class.

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.670
We can call this repeated.

11
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.770
Repeated.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.450
Tap or click on enter.

13
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.620
Okay.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.100
Now we do not really need this.

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.840
We can get rid of it.

16
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.080
And we can just duplicate this theory more times.

17
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.700
Okay.

18
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.290
You can try and save.

19
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.580
And go check it out.

20
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.890
Okay.

21
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.990
Now, the issue is the names are same.

22
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.800
Now, what we can do is we can make this dynamic.

23
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.440
To do that, we have to go to the top class.

24
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.100
And over here we are going to create a final variable and it is a type of test or we are expecting the

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.730
test.

26
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.920
So it's going to be a type of string and we can call this type two and we have to pass it on to the

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.170
constructor and we are going to make this required that this any time we call this repeated tab, we

28
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.750
are going to need to pass the value to the title.

29
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.390
So to do that, we have to say required in this thought title.

30
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.950
You can see in order to make it not required, we could get rid of this and had a question mark over

31
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.890
here to say it can be nor you can see it is not longer really needed.

32
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.840
Okay, we're just going to make this required.

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.100
And we have to pass the value.

34
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460
Okay for this title.

35
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.190
Sorry.

36
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.980
We also do need to get rid of this and pass in that title right here.

37
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.940
Try to.

38
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.530
I'll click on this.

39
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.340
And this is going to say, man.

40
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.410
And tie to this is going to say women, right?

41
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.220
And tie to this is going to say kids.

42
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.250
And finally, tie two and this is going to say shoes.

43
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.340
Okay.

44
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.890
Now it's come true.

45
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.970
And that's the save.

46
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.810
Okay.

47
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.500
And go check this out.

48
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.270
Okay.

49
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.760
Sounds good, right?

50
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.550
And our code looks more cleaner.

51
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.710
And what you can just do is you can.

52
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.490
You can create a new file and copy and paste this line of code.

53
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.480
You can copy and paste all this rather than having it.

54
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.220
You can just leave it here.

55
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.060
Okay.

56
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.050
Sounds good, right?

57
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.780
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
