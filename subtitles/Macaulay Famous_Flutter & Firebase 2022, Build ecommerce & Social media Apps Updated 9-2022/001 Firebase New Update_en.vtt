Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.130
Welcome.

3
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.810
In the next lecture, we are going to integrate Firebase, but before then, Firebase slightly updated

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.870
the code from this to this.

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.230
So in my video, this is what you're going to see.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.060
But currently this is what you should be saying, right?

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:33.960
So what you have to do, you can see why we have the high D and as of previous we have the apply plugin,

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.890
right?

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.330
So what you have to do is to create the apply plugin yourself.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.730
Okay.

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.800
Over here.

12
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.190
You just have to create the apply plug in yourself.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.940
And how this.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.210
And you then have to copy this and.

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.580
Pays this over a year and you then have to get rid of this ID, right?

16
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.030
Okay.

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.170
And this is basically the update.

18
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.820
So what I'm saying in general is you have to go with my my code.

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.560
Okay.

20
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.870
Okay.

21
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.750
And.

22
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.820
We do not really need to copy this over here because we already have it over here.

23
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.580
You can see it's the first apply plugin.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.370
Then come the Android application and you can see it over here.

25
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.180
Just that it's now being called Heidi.

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.690
Com or android application and the idea is basically referring to this value over a.

27
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.950
So all you just have to do is to I'm just going to do this again.

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.350
Okay.

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450
Default is going to look like this, right?

30
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.030
So you have to create the apply plugin yourself.

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.140
But for my case, what I simply did was to copy it.

32
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
But you can see you can't copy yours because it does not really have that.

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.760
It does not have that apply plugin anymore.

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.450
Right.

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.760
So what I basically just did was to copy it.

36
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.590
But since you can't copy it, you have to create it yourself.

37
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.470
So this is going to be applied plugin.

38
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.190
And this.

39
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.460
And then we have to copy this.

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.010
Right.

41
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.330
Like I said, we do not need this because we already have it in our code default.

42
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.610
So we can then copy this again, sorry, and paste this.

43
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.130
And now we have to get rid of the ID and this is basically it.

44
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.500
So in general what I'm basically saying is you have to go with mine because it's still same as this.

45
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.730
Okay.

46
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.400
And that is basically update to date.

47
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.180
Okay.

48
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.240
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.

49
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.170
And in the next lecture, we are going to integrate Firebase.

50
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.840
And I hope this does not confuse you.

51
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.320
Okay.

52
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.430
And if it does, you can do well to always reach out to me and I'm fully available to support you.

53
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.710
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
