00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.890
Walker.

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.390
In this lecture, you will fully understand what a container does.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.130
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to have a box over here, and within the box, we can have

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.570
widgets inside it.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
But before then, we can just create a container.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.830
Okay, now, after this row, we can just have the train a comma.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.010
If we don't have a train, come over there and we can then have a container.

9
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.270
A container.

10
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.620
And as you know, the container has the height property and we can see heights of 60.

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:47.110
And in order to have access to a lot of properties the container has, we can then have a declaration

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.320
and a box declaration class.

13
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.930
Okay.

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.300
And the first step is to specify the colour of the container and we could say colours.

15
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.980
Those whites had the green cover and use container and has to save.

16
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.500
You can see the via OC.

17
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.040
Right and.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.440
We can make this a bit round.

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.170
Rounded.

20
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.290
The box decoration has the border radius and we could say border radius.

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.490
But every year.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.150
The secular of.

23
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.110
15.

24
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.480
We could just go to 15.

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
We just go with 15 and go check this out.

26
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.070
But you can see it's a bit rounded.

27
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.920
Now, this is the reason we have to use the box decoration.

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.430
Now, what we're going to do had the train come away and we can get rid of this decoration.

29
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.360
Right.

30
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.770
And we still have access to the colours property.

31
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.340
So you can see colours that whites can use containers.

32
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.580
You can see we still have access to the the Carlos property.

33
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.280
We sell the container.

34
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.260
But the problem is we do not have access to the border radius, you can see.

35
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.420
So that was the reason we have to get rid of this and have a declaration and then a box declaration.

36
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.840
Both decoration and we this way we have access to the colors and also we do have access to the border

37
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.880
radius where the radius.

38
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:47.860
The circular of 15 and some additional purposes added to the cover is necessary.

39
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220
And you can see we have this round, this shape.

40
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.070
Now what we're going to do is we're going to give space between each hedge that is the left to right

41
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.080
sub bottom and all sides.

42
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.030
To do that we have to wrap this container with a paddle.

43
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.440
So use counter and dots and wrap with padding of maybe ten.

44
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.610
Ten.

45
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.530
So.

46
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.980
It's going to.

47
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600
Well, it's very safe again.

48
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.750
And.

49
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.680
Go check it out.

50
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.900
You can see the space we have now.

51
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.190
It's in the container.

52
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.390
We can then have a chart.

53
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.400
In Tanzania right after the border with a box to cushion the child.

54
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.490
The child is going to be a column because we want multiple widgets within the container.

55
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.120
Right.

56
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.410
And they're going to be displayed vertically, that is from top to bottom.

57
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.090
So this is going to be a column, column widgets.

58
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.780
And as you know, the column can take multiple.

59
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.710
We just as these children, we're just going to stop here.

60
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.710
Then in the next lecture, we're going to continue from here.

61
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.660
Before then, use control.

62
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.740
And that's to save.

63
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.860
Okay, guys, see you in the next lecture.
