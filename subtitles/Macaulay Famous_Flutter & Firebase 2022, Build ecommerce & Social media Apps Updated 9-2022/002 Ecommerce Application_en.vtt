00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.859
Hi, Walker.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.960
In this video, I want to show you a bit of a view of the e-commerce application.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.950
If you didn't try this course.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.370
Okay.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.660
Now, when do you use your first visit or application?

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.780
This is going to be the first page.

7
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:24.010
This is going to see they can choose to slide this way or you will nest or you will skip.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.330
Okay.

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.040
They're just going to go back to the first page and skip again.

10
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.820
Okay.

11
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.030
You can see we are saying something else and now the user can choose to sign in using a variety of ways.

12
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.480
They can choose to sign in with Google, sign in as a guest or sign up.

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.920
They can pick an image from gallery.

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.060
Yeah.

15
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.780
And.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.410
Okay.

17
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.360
Okay.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.100
It's going to take you a few minutes, okay?

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.180
We're just gonna go to my dials.

20
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.870
And she this.

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.220
And then we can feel this.

22
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.760
Okay.

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.030
Since our idea of an account is no, go to the login.

24
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.920
We can even choose to.

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630
We set our password in case we forgot it.

26
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.830
Okay.

27
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.380
Now I'm just going to log in.

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.480
I think have.

29
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.210
This.

30
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.170
And.

31
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.710
Passwords is this.

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.440
Okay.

33
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.370
Well, again.

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.990
Okay.

35
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
There's a little user record corresponding to this identifier.

36
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.020
Okay.

37
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.640
I think.

38
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.580
Okay.

39
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.210
I see.

40
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.990
Okay.

41
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.190
I think I made a mistake.

42
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.430
Okay.

43
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.330
Okay.

44
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.970
Then we can click on logging.

45
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.090
Okay, great.

46
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.210
Now you can see this is our list of products.

47
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.020
Every little product over here and as well what this feels.

48
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.490
We can search.

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.230
We can.

50
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.220
Consequently, we don't have any item in our cards.

51
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.710
And this is my profile.

52
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.250
Go see the profile image, the email address, the user name, the phone number and so on.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.040
For the now, we're just having three categories.

63
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.110
The first category, the clothes categories.

64
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.820

68
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.300

This is just $5,000.

92
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.540
Okay.

93
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.290

Now currently please note there is no payment method, but if you want to have what we can, then I

105
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.250
can then make a video on how to integrate this tri payment gateway or pay for what is currently holding

106
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.610
now.

107
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.460
We don't have a commitment for this app, so you know, that's the order for this products.

108
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.790
All we just have to do is to click on checkout.

Okay.

117
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.320
Now we're going to go back to the well later, then we can.

118
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.940
Then go to my mother's.

119

Now, like I said, currently we don't have any permit made site for this.

127
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.820
But if you want to have one, we can then.

128
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.710
Make a video that I can then make a video on that for you on how to integrate this, try to meet all

129
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.340
the people.

130
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.040
But for now, we don't have.

131
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.030
Currently we are using the firebase.

132
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.490
What if you also want to then not to use a custom plan?

133
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.800
I can also make a video on that for you.

134
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.020
But currently this is.

135
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.350
Basically is we can go to the category to hot item.

136
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.590
Okay.

137
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.940
You can see currently we have it in cards, right, because we recently had that.

138
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.530
So that's okay.

139
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.720
I'm just going to remove it from my cards.

140
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.160
Okay.

141
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.180
Go to cards and did it this.

142
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.050
Then I can add it from the category.

143
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.500
Okay.

144
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.130
You're going to see is will be available now the prices on the dollar cards.

Okay.

146

Great.

147
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.700
Now we have it over here.

148
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.990
Right.

149
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.260
I can choose to increase the price and just get rid of this.

150
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.900
Okay.

151
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.950
So you think.

152
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.610
Okay.

153
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.150
Okay.

Okay.

161
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:51.000
The price on the dollar, the product ID, the quantity to the name of the product is technical trouble.

162
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.920
And the user, Heidi, writes, and as all we can.

I can't say the price is 50.

166
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.760
Sorry.

167
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.590
No, the product is Gucci.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.670
Who's she?

169

And the prize is maybe 79 to I hear it is going to go $70 and we can applaud.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.220
From Gallery.

171
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:32.270
It can look like this is an uploaded product and we can see that a category.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.570
There's going to be two calls.

173
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:44.540
Category and brand is going to go just for the discussion or you're going to type some two over to show

Okay.

182
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.050
Now let's go back to the home screen.

183
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.110
Okay.

184
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.140
