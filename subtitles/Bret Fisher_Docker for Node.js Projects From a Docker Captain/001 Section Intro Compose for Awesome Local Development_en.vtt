00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.435
All right. This section is an important one, and that's

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.480
why it's a little larger than the other ones.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.974
It's going to focus on the best parts of local

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.990
development setup.  Whether you're a DevOps tester,

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.683
or you're just a pure operator that is focusing

6
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.720
on testing other people's apps, or maybe you're focusing on

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.010
Jenkins and CI/CD deployments, or maybe you're a developer.

8
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.278
All of those need great local environments

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.930
for designing and developing container solutions.

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.806
You're going to need to have that skill set, including

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.830
Docker Compose, which is one of the best ways to do it.

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.207
This whole section is all about Compose and

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.829
pulling out all the sweet parts of Compose that will work

14
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.084
with Node to make it almost as good as running

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.960
native on your native localhost machine.

16
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.121
It is a little bit tricky sometimes to get Node the way you

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.929
want it, and I'm solving a lot of those problems for you in

18
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.460
these lectures. So stick with it.

19
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.589
Get through the assignments, which are important for

20
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.869
keeping that learning in your brain and retaining the

21
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.599
knowledge. You'll be thanking me later when you get through

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.509
this section on all the new Compose stuff that you have

23
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.300
in your arsenal.
