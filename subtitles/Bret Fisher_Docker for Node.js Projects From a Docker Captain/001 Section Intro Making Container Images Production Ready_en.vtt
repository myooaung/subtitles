00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.050
We're back to talking about images, again, in this section.

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.520
It's a level up from the previous sections on images.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.564
In the past, you've learned about good, efficient images

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.789
using all the features of Dockerfiles, the modern features

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.681
like BuildKit and multistage, and all that stuff for really

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.131
getting great Node Dockerfiles.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.525
Now, we're going to focus on specific features to layer

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.321
on top of that, just for production, to make sure

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.419
that you have all the last, little tidbits for your

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.139
production workloads. Before, we were really focused, a

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.090
little, bit on development and testing.

12
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.269
Now, we're going to add in those production features on top

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.429
of that. I've got some good assignments in there that you

14
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.130
should definitely use to retain knowledge and to test

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.720
whether you were paying attention.

16
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.539
Once you're done with this section, you're really going to

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.600
have a one-two punch on image building

18
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.633
using all the latest features for both dev and production

19
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.982
workloads in the same Dockerfiles.

20
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.789
That's a really great thing that we have finally in

21
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.790
2018-2019.

22
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.780
You're going to learn all about the rest of those features

23
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.530
in this section.
