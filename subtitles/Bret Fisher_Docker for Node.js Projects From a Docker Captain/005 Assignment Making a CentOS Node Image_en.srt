1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm going to stop talking for a few minutes

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,108
and let you create an image for CentOS

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,499
with Node installed. The scenario here is that you're

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,389
in an Enterprise that can't use,

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,782
or is not allowed to use,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,980
Debian or the Alpine base official images,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,619
and that you'll need to create something maybe on Ubuntu,

8
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:23,739
or CentOS, or some other standard base image

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,000
that your company requires.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,569
In this case, I'd like you to go through the exercise of creating

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,438
an image that starts from the latest CentOS.

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,869
All right. You're going to go find the official CentOS image,

13
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,730
which is linked in this reference,

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,819
but it's basically just go CentOS on Hub

15
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,909
and look for official. Then you're going to install

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,120
the binaries of Node.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,239
So, to cheat, this is what I always do is I want

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,552
to see how the official repo installs Node.

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,060
I would go to the Node official image.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,671
In this case we're going to use the 10 track.

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,619
I would look at the latest 10 image.

22
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,812
Basically you're going to click on the link to the Dockerfile

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,720
in that repo.

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,438
You'll see the Dockerfile there, and you can copy the lines out that

25
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:06,290
are important.

26
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,089
The nice thing here is that you can use an env to specify the Node

27
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,802
version. You're going to create an env in your Dockerfile

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,279
where you can just change the version and in that way,

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,521
it will pull the different binaries.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,030
Because you're not going to be building Node.

31
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,030
You're going to be pulling down the binaries from the official

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,763
download locations on the Node.js website.

33
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,989
That's because we're stealing the lines from the official Node

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,520
image, which is what they do there.

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,427
Essentially you'll read through that Dockerfile.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,000
Understand how they do it.

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,770
Then copy out the lines that are relevant,

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,311
and then make your own lines in a new Dockerfile,

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,120
based on CentOS.

40
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,790
Expect this to take a few tries,

41
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,769
right. I'm not going to get it right the first time as I go through

42
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,160
the assignment. It'll be my first time doing this in a while,

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,330
so I will do a couple of things wrong,

44
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,991
and you may also do a couple of things wrong.

45
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:55,380
And that's fine. This is sort of a learning process for how

46
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,630
and what you would need in this image to create your own

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,580
custom base Node layer.

48
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,209
Just as a reminder, this is useful for us to understand,

49
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,179
and it's a good habit to just every once in a while take an

50
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,530
app that you've been using for a while

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,150
and then try to make one of them on your own.

52
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,070
Essentially your own custom image.

53
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,480
You don't need to do this unless you need to do this,

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,886
right. If you are not in a company that requires CentOS

55
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,290
or Ubuntu, there's really no reasons to go outside the default

56
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,580
base images of Debian

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,609
and Alpine. I always use the defaults unless

58
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,610
I'm with some specific project in a company where they

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,410
have standardized on,

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,119
I don't know, some sort of Red Hat

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,320
or custom,

62
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,309
other image out there that I don't have as a default

63
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,900
choice in the official repo.

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,380
Just keep that in mind.

65
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,930
Good luck.

66
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,460
Once you've got it working,

67
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,950
or when you get stuck and you just can't seem to get it working,

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,030
then check out my assignment answer coming up next.
