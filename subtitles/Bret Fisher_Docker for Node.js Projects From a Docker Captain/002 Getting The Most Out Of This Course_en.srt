00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,589
Before we get to the good stuff in this course, I want to

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,432
give you a few pieces of advice on how to get the most out

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,169
of it. Obviously, you can just watch the lectures if you

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,050
want, but there's a lot more that you can get

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,430
out of this content.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,040
Multiple ways, multiple senses.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,680
One of the ways that's going to help is with Foxy.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,300
This is my mascot, Foxy.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,450
She is here to help let you know when different

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,070
types of learning are going to happen.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,896
When you see exercises that have example commands, she'll

12
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:35,543
let you know. She'll also show up when it's assignment

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,623
time, when you're going to take a moment to learn on your

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,536
own, getting your hands on the keyboard to make things

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,559
happen. Then you get an assignment answer after that on how

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,834
I did it. So, thanks Foxy!

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,263
See you soon! The rest of this stuff is outside

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,530
of the lecture format.

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,809
You'll notice that Udemy has the Q & A, so you can

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,329
definitely check that out. The search in the Q & A is

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,290
great. This course has search in all the

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,987
closed captioning. Which means when you search in the

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,050
lectures, you get to search every word that I'm saying, in

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,755
every video. Clicking on that will actually take you to

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,350
that part of the video. It's pretty neat.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,950
The other parts are off the platform of Udemy.

27
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,269
Let me just list what's going on.

28
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,849
There's several lectures below this that will get you into

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,460
the details of the key stuff you need to do.

30
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,086
First is the Slack Chat.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,453
That's the community-based Slack live

32
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,989
chat channel that if you've never used Slack before, it's

33
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,146
just another chat like Facebook chat, or any

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,459
chat. That's one of the best pieces that come along

35
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,720
with this course because it's not just me there, or the

36
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,298
TA's. It's the entire community.

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,725
We have, I think at this point, over 15,000 people that

38
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,060
have taken my courses in there.

39
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,450
There's action every day.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,883
People are talking about Docker, Kubernetes,

41
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,950
DevOps, other stuff.

42
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,100
They've made it a really great place to learn and help

43
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,919
others. I think one of the best ways to learn something is

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,430
to help others doing it along with yourself.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,870
So, that's a key place to be.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,925
Next, is the YouTube Live Weekly Q & A.

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,180
We're on Thursdays, most of the time.

48
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,510
You can show up on my YouTube Live channel.

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,410
Details in the next couple of lectures.

50
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,260
You can ask questions in chat.

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,569
I will try to come up with good answers live on the

52
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,314
Internet. We spend about an hour or so, and that show is

53
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,090
recorded and shows back up on YouTube later that day.

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,190
So, if you miss it, you can always watch it later.

55
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,311
Now, clips from that show, the best questions you

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,428
ask and the best answers that I have, end up back on

57
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,990
YouTube in little clips.

58
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,749
Some of those that are related to this course will show up

59
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,100
back in this course.

60
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,580
Then finally, DevOps and Docker Talk podcasts,

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,181
by Bret Fisher, is on all the

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,310
places that I know you can get podcasts.

63
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,140
So, you can now listen to that in audio only format.

64
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,472
Essentially, what it is is the best parts of that YouTube

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Live show every week.

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,589
There's also a newsletter that you can find at the end of

67
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,334
this course. There's obviously other courses that I have

68
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,749
as well. You can find that information at the end of this

69
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,720
course. Definitely check out all of this stuff.

70
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,070
A little bit at the beginning.

71
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,860
Maybe you just want to get started, and that's fine.

72
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,599
Just remember to come back later. Because I think one of

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,295
the biggest ways to retain this knowledge is to consume

74
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,685
it and use it in various ways, not just in watching the

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,680
videos. So, good luck and I'll see you in the course.
