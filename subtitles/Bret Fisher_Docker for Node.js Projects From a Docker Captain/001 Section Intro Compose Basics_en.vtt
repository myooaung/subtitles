00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.449
This course relies heavily on Docker Compose, which

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.680
is a tool designed for local dev and test

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.210
to make it easier for Docker workflows.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.886
In fact, Docker built the tool designing it around the

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.420
typical workflow of a dev test prod lifecycle

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.509
where you're going to be building a bunch of stuff on your

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.430
local machine, and then eventually ship it off.

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.850
It's a great tool.

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.466
We're going spend a lot of time on it in this course.It's

10
00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:27.290
really going to help you save some time.

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.176
If you're new to it, this section is going to focus on

12
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.661
the CLI and the file format for using Docker Compose.

13
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.730
If you're not new to it maybe it's a good review

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.549
anyway. It's got an assignment at the end to make sure that

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.040
you've got the basics down before we start jumping heavily

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.900
into using Docker Compose day to day.
