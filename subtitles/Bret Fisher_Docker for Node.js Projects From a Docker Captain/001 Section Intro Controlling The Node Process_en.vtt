00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.800
This section is a good one because we're going to be

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.550
talking about the specifics of Node

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.740
and how it runs in a container.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.440
Specifically, how do we deal with it shutting down,

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620
starting up, and the Linux systems

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.750
that control what's going on that container.

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.742
The thing is that a lot of people gloss over this part, or

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.810
read outdated, or just plain wrong, blog entries

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.080
about how to deal with the problem of Node

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.150
being controlled properly inside a container.

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.879
Specifically how does it shut down and properly get

12
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.232
replaced. And so I wanted to focus on that for a

13
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.594
whole section and give you some good assignments to deal

14
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.859
with this problem and understand the various options you

15
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.630
have and which ones you should use when.
