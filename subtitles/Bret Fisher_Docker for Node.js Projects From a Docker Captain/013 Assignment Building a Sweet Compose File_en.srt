1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,930
Building a sweet Compose file.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,280
That's really what this whole section was about.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,283
It was lecture after lecture and granted, there was a lot

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,380
of lectures. So, sorry about all the lectures.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,330
But, really they're all focused around the same thing:

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,849
making sure that you're getting all the best stuff out of

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,280
the Compose file for your Node.js setup.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,598
This is the test for all that stuff.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,773
I really wanted this to be one assignment instead of lots

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,220
of little assignments.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,239
Because this one assignment is exactly what you're going to

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,170
be doing, on and off, when you're migrating your Node.js

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,004
apps into Docker, or even creating new apps in

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,870
Docker for Node.js.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,920
This is exactly the same process you'll go through.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,967
What I'm going to give you is Docker's popular voting

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,305
app demo. It's a distributed, multi-service

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,938
app, using databases and various languages

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,170
for different services.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,090
One of those is a Node.js app.

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,359
It's the result website for a voting app.

22
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:59,970
You're going to be voting on dogs versus cats.

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,370
If you've been in my other courses, you may have seen that.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,239
I use it often in my demos because it's an easy one to

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,040
understand. It's pretty to look at, and it's

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,889
got a lot of the potential problems that you might have in

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,890
a distributed app.

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,350
Imagine you're the Node.js developer.

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,310
You're getting this simple Compose file from the team.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,460
It's got multiple other services unrelated

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,189
to your Node.js app but are needed in order for you to get

32
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,493
the full functionality, and for testing, right.

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,540
To just make sure the app works as you intended.

34
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,690
You're going to need to turn that Compose file into the

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,671
ultimate Compose file, like you learned all throughout this

36
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,483
section. Let me take you real quick through the files and

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,920
the readme before you get started.

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,052
If you go into the repo for this course and look

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,366
at the assignment, sweet compose directory, you'll

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,284
see the two files and then a subdirectory that

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,110
you need for this assignment.

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,170
The readme we'll go through in a second.

43
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,969
The Docker Compose is very similar to the one that comes

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,017
from the official result app from Docker.

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,310
Then the result is a directory full of the

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,979
Node.js app that you're going to need to set up as if

47
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,090
you're going to develop it locally.

48
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,749
If we just take a quick look at the Docker Compose file, it

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,000
comes very simple, right.

50
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,538
This is a great example of how you would maybe even

51
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,618
get Docker Compose, if you get one at all, for a new

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,880
project. It might come in with the very basics like this.

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,419
This is great because it comes out of a sample repo

54
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,619
where they show deploying it all the time, but there's a

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,080
lot missing from here. We don't have the depends on.

56
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,210
We don't have bind mounts for local development.

57
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,130
We're not opening ports for debugging.

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,880
There's all sorts of stuff here that's missing.

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,869
The only thing I think I've really done here is I've

60
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,080
changed the version from the Version 3 that it came as

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,140
from Docker, to Version 2.4.

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,429
So, that's really what I want you to stick with because

63
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,409
that's the latest Version of 2, and that will get you the

64
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,690
most development features.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,789
You can go through here and it'll start up at top with the

66
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,800
Redis in the database for the data storage.

67
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,619
You've got the voting app, which is a website for voting

68
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,880
cats versus dogs.

69
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,900
Then you have the result app, which is the one you're going

70
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:56,940
to be working on.

71
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,210
It's set up for a port.

72
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,410
Of course, you can change that, but there's nothing there

73
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,563
that you need for development. It needs all the other dev

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,972
features. I'm hoping you'll stay away from the Dockerfile

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,473
because maybe someone else was creating that and you only

76
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,844
really have authority in this pretend scenario

77
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,419
to mess with the Docker Compose files. So, you're going to

78
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,380
need to focus on that for all of your setup and

79
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,179
to just kind of work with the code that you've got inside

80
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
the result app.

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,749
Then lastly, you have a worker app that just kind of runs

82
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,509
in the background. You have two networks that are already

83
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,910
set up for you and a volume for the database.

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,880
Really, the focus here is going to be on

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,578
the steps that I've given you in the readme.

86
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,831
If you go to the top of the readme, you

87
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,709
get sort of the basics of the story of why this is going to

88
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,454
go the way it is and a pretend narrative that you're the

89
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,470
Node.js developer in a team of people, and your

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,510
responsibility is just for the result app.

91
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,614
Then it goes through a list in no particular order, of

92
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,560
all the things I'd like you to do to this application

93
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,236
in the Compose file. It's whole purpose here is to set

94
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,205
up all the things you just learned throughout this section

95
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:04,410
in the Compose file to make it super awesome.

96
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,500
Then, down at the bottom, once you think you've done that,

97
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,380
are some valid testing things you can do.

98
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,850
That doesn't mean you're writing any code.

99
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,129
You shouldn't have to write any code, in fact, to get this

100
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,678
done. This is all really about configuration to make

101
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,249
the app work the best for local development and debugging.

102
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,490
So, don't worry if you have to go back and reference the

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,670
lectures and those videos from throughout this section.

104
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,190
It was a very large section so thanks for sticking with it.

105
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,188
Good job for getting here to the end.

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,169
I wanted to give this all in one, large assignment because

107
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,828
this is often how you'll get to do this in real-world

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,170
projects. You'll be given this file, in this setup, and

109
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,690
it may take you a day. It may take you 20 minutes.

110
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
It just really depends on how much time you have, and so

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,050
feel free to save these files in the middle and maybe

112
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,569
go inside the readme and check off each one that you've

113
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,020
done. That's kind of how you're going have to work

114
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,669
through it. You may not be able to do all of these things

115
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,620
in one sitting or certainly get them working.

116
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,530
The first time I did it, it definitely took me some time to

117
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,700
work through all the different steps.

118
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,082
Don't be afraid to go rewatch some of the videos

119
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,150
or even do some Internet searching before you watch my

120
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,360
assignment answers video coming up next.
