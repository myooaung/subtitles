00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,050
This section is all about your Node Dockerfiles,

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,830
which are going to be the fundamental building blocks for

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,438
everything we do for the rest of the course.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,644
To get it out of the way, we're going to jump

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,450
into understanding the different types

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,028
of Node from images, or which base images you should

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,759
use to make sure that you're building the right images, on

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,259
the right foundations. Then we'll jump into a quick

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,550
assignment just to see how to make your own custom

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,579
Node image for something like CentOS that doesn't have a

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,380
default image on Docker Hub.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,100
Then I'll go a little bit into how you're going to use

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,945
least privilege and increase security to lock down your

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,190
Node containers.

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,419
We'll also look at some features in the Dockerfile to make

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,450
your images efficient, which mostly has to do with size

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,500
and speed of building.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,291
That's important once you get to automated CI and

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,870
especially when you get to production when you want minimal

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,360
size and also speed of deployments.
