00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.490
You spent so much time in this course and now it's

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.169
all coming together. You've got your great local

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.899
development set up. You've got these great Dockerfiles that

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.320
now work in production. You're a Compose Master.

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.141
Now, we're going to be talking about deploying to

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.770
production and what concerns you need to have with Node.js

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.568
specifically, as well as common problems that people

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.659
deploying containers for the first time might have in

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.000
production that will help you with Node.js.

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.170
Node.js is often used for Web frameworks, Web apps, so

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.056
there is some bonus stuff in here around that specific

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.020
problem using HTTP proxies, and

13
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.366
HTTP connection shutdowns, and stuff like, that

14
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.510
maybe won't be for every Node.js app.

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.330
But, certainly a large percentage of the

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.989
Node.js apps out there are Web protocol based using

17
00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:51.445
HTTP.

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.740
You're going to be learning some of that stuff including

19
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.590
when not to use Compose in production.

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.495
When to use something like Swarm or Kubernetes to learn

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.421
about orchestration for Node.js, and some of those concerns

22
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.859
like proxies in connection management.

23
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.930
Then how to replace those in production because, of course,

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.999
once you deploy your app, you've got to replace it

25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.200
eventually with a new version.

26
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.340
Then, looking at some sample files even around Docker

27
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.749
Swarm and Kubernetes in case you're going to look at

28
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.710
orchestration later on.
