1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,080
Docker was designed for the cloud.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,320
It works great everywhere but it really works

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,260
well when you're focusing your apps on

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,300
12 factor design patterns.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,039
You maybe don't know what that is yet. But, you're going to

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,400
learn in this section about design optimization

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,560
for things that are distributed.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,120
And, the cloud is distributed.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,039
In fact, your data centers are probably becoming more and

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,469
more distributed, so you definitely want to understand

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,312
these principles so that your Node apps are using the best

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
parts of Docker they can.

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,919
You're also going to learn, in this section, about the

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,590
dockerignore file that's similar to the gitignore.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,012
That will help you keep things out of your images that you

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,479
don't want. You're going to do an assignment that's very

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,930
much like real-world stuff that I do all the time.

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,780
Which is take existing Node apps and migrate them into

19
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,995
containers. Even old Node apps that you maybe

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,040
need old setups and design.
