00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
Welcome back.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.950
Now that our application is ready with surveys,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.290
workers favor icons,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.660
manifest torches on everything bigger,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.270
clear production bill again.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.820
And redeploy that on our fire base.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.720
So let's go ahead with that.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.380
First,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.690
let's make sure that we are in the project directory,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.040
which I am right now in.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.470
And then I'm gonna tape your NPM run build on.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.160
That's going to create a production build.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.910
And now that it is done,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.230
I'm gonna clear the screen.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.320
I'm gonna take here.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.990
Fire based deployed on this is gonna ship all the content of the build folder toe the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.470
firebase hosting the deployment is complete.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.950
I'm gonna copy this Ural on.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.810
Then go back to the browser and then replace this year with the one that I copied.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.720
I'm gonna press Enter on now.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.120
You can see we have a new icon overhears.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.560
We can also check here that there is a plus icon on the right side off your address bar

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.650
with this install movie browser and you can see the title here coming from the manifest or

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.190
Jason,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.200
we can do an install when I click on this.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.250
Install what?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.760
It does it.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.380
It's gonna Acto my chrome applications and know that it came as a separate standalone

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.150
window.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.850
So it has been disconnected from the browser on.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.120
It works as if it's a separate application itself so we can work on all the things that we

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.900
have worked earlier.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.450
For example,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.210
I can look for a movie,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.910
let's a mission and then press enter.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.890
We should get movies with the title mission in it on.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.890
I'm gonna click on this,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.230
and I still have the loading image on the details of the movie that's coming up.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.330
So this is an application by itself.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.970
Off course.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.860
We still have an option over here to say open in chrome or copy the Ural uninstall movie

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.230
brother.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.470
Few options that come on automatically over here anyway,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.800
So I'm gonna just exit out off this on,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.640
then with it.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.540
Our application in the browser,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.520
which is called React Jizz movie browser Doubtfire based After come.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.280
Now that we have here,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.230
we can press option command I r f to Ellen Chrome on.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.910
We got this audit tool over here,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.150
which is our lighthouse are a tool.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.530
We don't want anything other than the progressive about this time,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.080
so I'm gonna untech all of them and then only going to lead up from December back.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.630
So when I click on the gender deport this time,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.940
you should see now that our application is 100% progressive Web application to verify

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.810
whether it works offline are not.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.780
What I can do is I can go on and disabled my wife.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.540
I'm gonna turn off my WiFi on de.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.760
So no WiFi right now.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.470
If I do a page reload,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.590
you should still see the content and not anything else.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.090
If you are on,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.170
for example,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.190
a different tab,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.420
and then try to with it some other website.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.980
For example,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.880
if I tried to go toe,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.180
say facebook dot com,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.610
which is no Internet,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.320
but my application has absolutely no problem,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.510
so I can copy this Ural pasted in a different type placental.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.850
You can see that our applications still works.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.730
However,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.880
What doesn't work is if I search for a movie like tar,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.200
I may not get any output.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.780
We still have the common look and feel off our application.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.820
It is not giving something like no Internet or here.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.040
So since our application has been installed,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.310
you can also check the same thing by going toe.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.330
Chrome colon.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.670
APS on.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.040
You should now see that there is a movie browser application that is readily available over

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.550
here,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.440
apart from other applications here,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.180
of course,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.950
that I'll great out because I don't have Internet connection.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.490
But I still should be able to access the same thing by clicking on that and you can see it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.340
just comes up as a separate application on Mac toys.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.300
You can also press command space.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.750
Balto open what is called as the spotlight on.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.120
Then you should be able to say movie browser,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.180
and that should come up automatically like that.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.600
Let's also try opening the same thing on a mobile device.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.130
Andi,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.330
I am on my android phone over here,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.820
so I'm gonna go open Crow on,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.710
then with it.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.190
The website React Js Dash Movie Dash Browser Doubtfire with up dot com.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.580
When I select that you can see now that I got an option here toe add movie browser to home

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.050
screen.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.050
If I click on that,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.960
it's going toe now Ask me once again at the home screen I click on Add on,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.600
but now it is adding to our home screen after scanning,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.880
and it's done now,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.440
it has been installed,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.650
so I can now go back to my screen and you can see that there is a movie browser application

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.170
icon.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.580
When I click on this,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.180
you can see it's going to launch that initial home page with an icon as the last movie

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.320
brother title.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.940
And then I have an application that's coming up right here.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.600
I can search for movies,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.010
Let's say,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.950
for example,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.430
Spider on Ben say such I should get the list of all the movies just like the previous wants

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.430
.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.690
One below the other on tapping on one of the movie should give me the details off the movie

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.250
quickly.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.610
I can take on the back button to go back on,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.050
select a different movie on.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.550
You can see the loading icon as well as the actual details off the movie as well.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.290
So it is an application by itself.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.840
It's not running on the browser.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.490
Concede that the room is over here.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.950
I'm gonna exit the room on I'm going toe exit our application also.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:34.860
Now,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.720
at any point in time,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.620
if you feel that you don't want the application,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.350
you can just long press the icon and that comes with uninstall.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.280
Option on.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.720
You can now release their under to do an actual uninstall off application as well,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.850
so you can see that application has been uninstalled.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.730
So this is how it works.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.090
Are behaves on a mobile device.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.440
So that's all for this particular lecture.
