00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.090
welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.350
Let's create a component called Header and then use the same thing in our Abdullah Jess.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.260
So for that,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.350
let's go to the Components folder.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.970
Create a new file here called header dot Js Ex.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.990
You may keep the extension and start chase,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.200
but with the Dodge,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.700
a six extension via scored helps us automatically create HTML tax.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.410
We'll see that in a minute.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.000
So let's start by giving the header Dark chair sex as the filing press enter for this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.360
particular example,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.550
I want toe create a class based component which is also called US State.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.290
Full component.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.750
Let's start by typing I am RC and that's going toe import the default exported member as

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.640
react on and named the member called Component from this particular model.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.680
Apart from that,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.970
we simply have a Type C C as to create a class based component.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.470
This actually uses the name of the file,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.950
which is had a large A six.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.800
It takes the base name header and creates a class called Header that extends component

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.290
their state.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.460
I don't need state for this particular example,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.390
and then we are going to have a rendered function to written,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.830
in example,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.650
which is actually an HTML and XML syntax.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.330
Let's have a deal here with a couple of class names from bootstrap.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.240
So the where you can do it again,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.720
simply type dot alert dot alert,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.150
dash primary.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.220
Now I know that we're gonna get in html Syntax like Dale class name equals toe alert,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.560
alert,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.110
primary.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.380
And then the culture is going to be waiting inside this.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.360
Now,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.090
this is possible because we have given the file name extension and start chair sex.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.120
But if you have given dot Js,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.520
then you have to ensure that at the bottom right side here,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
there is a JavaScript reactive to kick on that you can see that there are many other

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.750
options available.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.530
You have to manually choose jealous,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.250
kept react.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.290
But because the extension is dark,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.080
JSX it has automatically taken that.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.990
So coming back over here,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.740
I'm gonna just It is the same type.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.540
Why again?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.780
And you consider get this dot alert,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.750
dark primary.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.840
When I pressed enter,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.070
you may observe one small difference over here.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.600
Typical in html be type CSS class references class that maybe would have said deal

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.700
classical Stowe.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.290
But since class is a key word in Jeolla.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.350
Skeptics ml we can't use the class keeper over here.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.990
Every type class accidentally,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.640
because I copied from somewhere else.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.880
Dissenter snippet.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.790
You may have to manually change each one of them in tow.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.400
Class name.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.390
Otherwise you'll get warnings in the only Russians off the edges.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.750
It used to be an editor.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.550
Now it's consider as a warming because the reactors compiler has matured over a period in

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.880
time.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.650
So anyway,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.910
we got this class name equals to this.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.400
I'm gonna press Enter on inside this family are one more due this time a class called

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.150
container.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.700
So what container does it?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.380
It's gonna give a fixed a weight off around 1100 pixels.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.310
So I'm gonna leave that as it is.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.580
And inside this,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.790
I want to have a hitch.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.480
One that simples is movie browsers.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.830
So I'm going to say your hitch.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.460
One movie,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.030
Broza,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.580
Now the file head of R.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.130
J six has been created.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.400
It exports a component over here,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.740
but it's never being used anywhere.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.980
So to use the same thing,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.080
I go back to the Abdur Gs.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.310
Let's get it off the H one on in place of the rich one.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.450
I want toe include the head of J six.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.290
So I can say here simply header like this and then press enter.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.660
You can see it is auto import header from the dot slash header and that's nice because now

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.250
we didn't have to do that manually.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.220
So as soon as they say this file,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.520
if I go back to the browser,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.100
you can see that we have a a nice header which says here,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.290
a movie blows up in our application were also goingto provide a search box over here that

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.110
allows us to search for movies.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.130
Even though we're not gonna add any functionality to that feature,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.430
we'll just add a text box that looks nice and that allows us to type in something so that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.780
we can search for that movie.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.390
Let's go back over here in the hetero J six.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.140
We want toe have a textbooks also Now,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.560
darling,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.210
the text boxes nicely.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.500
What we can do is we can divide this intersection from here toe the other end.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.380
We want to do it that in tow.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.770
Two columns So bootstrap CSS framework allows us to create a role with multiple columns.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.960
Let's have a look at that.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.180
I'm gonna remove that H one from here right now.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.020
And then I'm gonna create a classier card,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.650
a tro which contains a child with a class name off call MD.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.940
For now,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.360
this is to say that I want a column for a medium device.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.750
It should occupy four grids.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.990
The boat trip comes with the concept off a great system.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.510
So where Roy is made up off 12 grids and that this one is gonna occupy four grades in a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.360
medium device,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.600
If you may ask,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.060
what's the medium device?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.150
Bush have also considers four different kinds of devices on extra small device or excess

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.250
that represents mobile devices.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.830
You may have a smaller devices,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.560
which is Ah,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.950
not as mobile phone,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.810
but probably you have a smaller iPad,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.550
for example,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.340
or a bigger phones.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.780
They're small device are SN on medium the way that such as your laptop screens our computer

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.500
monitors.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.000
But then there is one more called LG for large.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.050
So which is meant for high resolution bigger screens.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.140
So you have excess SN bmd on algae.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.500
So MD means MD and LG.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.030
Also,

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.450
if you give your sm.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.550
Then it's gonna be s M M D and algae.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.700
Anyways,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.210
at this time,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.280
we want to target our laptop screams.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.870
We're also going to see how there's gonna look in a mobile device.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.100
But anyway,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.100
so this is the first column off my room where our hitch one is gonna appear.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.240
We also want one more,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.960
So I'm gonna say plus dot call dash MD Dash the remaining eight out of 12 you can see here

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.040
it's going to show how this is gonna come up eventually.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.870
So it says Duke,

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.270
last name,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.870
off roll.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.650
And that's this part A great land means these are two child elements of plus indicates it's

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.220
the child.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.370
Now,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.530
if you want to add another child for this,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.310
you may want to group them using a bracket.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.340
So at this time,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.250
let's keep it simple.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.700
So we have a dot rope great than dot call dash MD four,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.010
plus another column with eight groups on a medium device.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.190
So I press enter,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.690
and now we see we got do with two more lives as child lives on,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.850
as in the earlier case,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.060
I'm gonna express enter here and then add that each one.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.320
I think it's got movie browser,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.790
and that's fine.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.800
If I go back here,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.380
you won't see much difference.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.310
But if I added textbooks over here,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.980
you should see some difference.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.640
I'm going to stay pure input.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.420
So that's the text box.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.950
If you wanted.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.060
At the search box,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.110
you convey colon search,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.700
so that's going to give you input type physical to search with a class name,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.600
off form dash control That would be one toe have.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.350
This is again a class them from bootstrap.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.720
This is gonna nicely style that it's going to occupy the full wit place.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.670
It's also going to give you a proper tiding border.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.220
It's the drugs,

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.470
so it's nice.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.750
I'm gonna press enter.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.570
We're not going to give any name already for any of these things at this point in time.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.240
So let's just ignore that the dummy text books.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.100
At this point in time,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.710
you can add something like placeholder equals toe on.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.260
Then say search dr dot and save this.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.800
If I go back to a browser now,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.010
you can see here that there is a movie brother with that search box right there,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.080
and because Hetch one is a bit bigger compared toa this.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.860
You'll see that it's kind of aligned towards the top.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.150
So instead of H one,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.010
let's go and make this as hits three.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:35.320
So I'm gonna sell it this once and then press commander D to select the 2nd 1 on windows

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.110
press control.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.550
De usually bought the hitch ones are selected and car sarees blinking at both the places.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.550
I can simply type h three now and then it gets reflected in both the places as well,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.950
so I'm going to save it.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.260
Go back to the browser American See?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.950
It looks pretty neat.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.530
So movie brother,

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.460
that's our H one starting from here till here it's the four grij and from here,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.360
till here is the remaining eight groups.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.170
So one drove with two columns on That's it for this lecture where we created a header

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.050
component and added to our application
