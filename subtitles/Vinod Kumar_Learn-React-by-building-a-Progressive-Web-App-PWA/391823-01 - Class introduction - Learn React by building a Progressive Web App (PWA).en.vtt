00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
welcome toe learn react by developing a purpose in that my name is we know and I'll be your

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.460
personal instructor for this course.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.980
In this course,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.320
we will be learning the basics off the edges by actually developing a really the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.250
application that allows the user to search for details off the movie.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.080
Not only that,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.950
we will also be deploying it on a platform called Fire Base from Google so that anyone in

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.420
the world can access your application.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.950
Let me show you the end product first.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.450
The website address is https Colon double slash Really Jace Dash movie Dash browser.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.120
Not Fire based after you Can Actually with it,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.640
the website.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.160
Right now,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.650
the home page has a picture of mine and as a search box on the top.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.060
When you enter a movie title are part of the movie title in the search box and then pressed

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.780
in Turkey or the return key.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.780
The application returns the list off 10 movies that contained those search term in their

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.450
titles.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.750
For example,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.250
if I go here and then search for say,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.130
baby and then enter,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.090
you'll see that it displays the list off 10 movies that have the world baby in the title.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.500
If you click on a particular movie,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.610
it will also show the details,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.480
but the same thing.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.360
You also have a back button over here.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.780
You can also see when I take on a movie,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380
and if the movie has not been loaded yet,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.460
they'll be a progress indicator on.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.820
Then you get the movie and you can take on the back button over here toe.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.650
Go back to the previous stage.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.840
You can also click on the title of For Application,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.190
Moving closer to go back to the home page.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.180
Let me explain the high level architectural off our application.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.270
Here.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.480
You can see everything is done in your own laptop or PC.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.010
We would have installed something called Nor Jays,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.640
which acts as a platform for developing our applications on We don't need No,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310
just back from on our mission.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.620
One.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.220
That application is really on has been deployed.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.370
We use the Microsoft Visual Studio cord for editing our source code.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.090
Off course,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.220
you can choose a different idea off your choice.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.040
However,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.820
Microsoft Visual Studio Court has seen the number one when it comes to developing grab

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.350
application.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.050
So the Norges platform provides us a development Web server.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.070
We will be deploying our application on the development server,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.260
so when you do that,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.240
your application will be running on a full 3000.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.650
And once your application is up and running,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.720
you can access your application using a browser,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.750
which is again running on your own laptop.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.250
So the browser on your laptop with its the local Web server,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.950
which is running on your laptop.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.620
Once that happens,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.850
the reactions application is shipped to your browser on then it is completely running on

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.670
your browser,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.510
so there is no interactivity between the browser under Sarwar from this point forward,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.680
however,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.310
when it comes to retrieving movie details,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.980
your application directly communicates to 1/3 party websites for oil.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.430
Mdb ap dot com Using which you will be able to display the details off the movie or list of

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.820
movies in your application?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.020
No,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.310
it is at this point in time,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.860
we are still in the development faced,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.440
so our applications are work.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.340
It's still running,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.950
but we don't need this one.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.750
That application is completed.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.590
What we do once it is completed is we deploy our application onto a free hosting provided

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.260
by Google for fire Base our application six on the Google's cloud platform.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.000
Once your application is ready on day deployed on fire base,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.320
you can access that with public.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.890
You are in on any user who accesses this public.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.320
Ural.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.140
The actual react application is transferred from Google Firebase Toe the user's browser on

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.290
that,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.450
then completely runs on the browser.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.580
There is no connection required to five from that point forward.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.160
So the fire best is only going to serve as a static.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.210
Http server.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.520
Nothing more than that on the React application running on the client's browser now with

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.250
its the way and maybe a ph dot com directly and get all the movie details to show it on the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.130
client's machine on notice that the users laptop or PC don't have any Norges dependency at

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.370
all.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.590
So this is the high level architecture off the application that we're gonna build in the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.360
next lecture.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.010
Let's get started with the A.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.560
G s
