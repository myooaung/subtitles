00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780
welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.300
Let's understand what is a progressive up all about progressive kabobs,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.950
simply called PW is are the next big thing in the Web development.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.850
They bring mobile app like experience to the users off your Web applications.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.100
Your obligation on a mobile device can have many,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
many features,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.750
including access to camera offline,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.750
working push notifications on many others.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.560
However,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.530
there are eight baseline characteristics off a progressive of applications defined by

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.070
Google,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.960
and that's what we are actually going toe looking toe in this lecture.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.910
Number one site is so or https,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.130
since our application is deployed on Google's file base.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.610
Five Ways provides a SSL certificate three off cost.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.190
And if you stick it out here,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.260
there is a certificate,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.910
which is valid on the certificate is issued by GTs.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.310
See a or certificate authority experience on Tuesday.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.050
27.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.580
Delectable 2020.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.910
Of course,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.650
it's automatically going to be renewed as well.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.410
On.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.070
Here are some more details about that,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.140
so our application already satisfies the first requirement off beautifully.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.580
Number two pages are responsive on tablets and mobile devices.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.570
Since we have used the bootstrap CSS remark from Twitter,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.400
our application is mobile friendly as well.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.640
For example,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.530
if I press after on Google Chrome,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.810
our option command,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.350
I that's going to take me to the developer tools.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.390
You can see here that there is a small total device toolbar I can click on that on.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.180
My application is now shown as if it is a responsive one.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.800
I can also choose a different device.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.430
For example,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.680
I can say iPhone 67 or eight.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.280
I select that you can also add a frame over here for that short device frame,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.360
and you can see my application is going to look like this on a mobile device,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.090
specifically iPhone six or seven or eight.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.680
Now,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.020
if I'm going to search for a movie over here,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.880
let's say Iron Man and press enter and you can see that the movies are stag,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.030
one below the other automatically,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.070
without me having to do anything at all on.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.490
Similarly,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.020
when I click on a particular movie,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.830
you would see that they're the loading and then the poster comes up.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.290
The details are stacked up,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.250
one below the other.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.830
Now,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.810
if I'm goingto tell the phone,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.040
this is how it's gonna look like right?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.320
If I'm going toe.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.800
Let's say the home page are probably the back button over here.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.590
You can see that it's showing me one below the other.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.700
But if I'm gonna change this from iPhone toe say iPad on,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.730
you can see that the look and feel is different on iPad.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.090
So our application is already responsive in design because off bootstrap number T all at

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.550
euros Lord while offline.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.520
Now,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.130
this is the one that is failing factor in our application at this time.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.200
Our application does not lord offline.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.550
So if I go back to say,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.250
for example,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.650
homepage on,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.310
then my wife,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.550
I I'm gonna turn off,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.440
and then you can see if I reload the page,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.990
it's gonna come back and say,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.000
No Internet,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.190
however repeatedly,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.260
will still have something to show you on.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.910
Not the no intimate Adam message.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.970
So we can achieve this by using something called offline storage.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.250
Now html five introduced a concept called cashing mechanism.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.760
So if I go to the application tab over here,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.880
you can see that there is a cash storage application catch.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.860
These two can be used toe store,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.570
the html CSS java listed that is required to run out application on.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.280
Then whenever you're offline,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.000
your browser is smart enough to pick that from the cash and shows that so all the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.070
JavaScript will function as if the Internet is there.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.030
However,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.360
if your application tries to go back to Internet to collect some data like you're searching

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.080
for a movie,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.860
that feature may not work,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.260
because only thing that is cash here is the HTML that is the index,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.070
or HTML,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.650
CSS and JavaScript.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.450
So,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.690
to some extent we can still make our application function.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.720
So all the jobless good function it is can work as long as they're not dependent on the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.690
network data.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:00.580
So we're gonna use the cash storage and application cash on the cash management is done by

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.460
something called salaries worker.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.130
And if you go back to your application over here in the index start Js,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.210
you see that we have a mechanism that is salaries worker dot on register on Dhere is a

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.530
commented that is given by the ECJ is when we use the create react up.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.070
This came up automatically.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.510
If you want your app to work offline and load faster,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.060
you can change unregistered toe register below so that's all we have to do.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.470
So you just have to change this to register from unregistered.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.330
So all we have to do is to register the salaries worker onda the deploy the same thing,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.870
and you can see that there is the salaries.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.150
Workers are Js,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.420
and that's a standard jealous that file,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.510
which can be used on any Web application.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.360
It has got you events on the court inside.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.050
This file is the one that is responsible for cash management.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.480
So as the comment stays here,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.940
there are some pitfalls.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.270
You can do better by writing your own service workers as well.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.150
Number four meta data provided for at the home screen.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.860
Once your salaries worker is enabled,

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.200
you will automatically get option toe.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.310
Are your Web application to your mobile device home screen on that can be controlled by

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.540
something called Manifest or Jason.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.090
So if you look at your applications public folder,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.430
there is a file here called Manifest our Jason Manifest.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.000
Our Jason contains some information that helps us customize the mobile experience for the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.570
user number five First Lord forced even on a slow network like three G.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.090
If you remember our homepage,

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.860
has a minimalistic content which helps us Lord,

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.670
our application foster.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.540
In fact,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.470
the only slowness would be introduced because of the image that I have.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.550
So which we can a wide that and have a smaller image than the one that I already have to

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.380
improvise the speed on that.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.910
So what regionally do is we give a basic skeleton off our application in the beginning,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:09.520
and then,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.480
as them in the user starts clicking on options,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.110
we try to learn more and more content.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.010
This can also be done by using a concept called Court Split.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.610
We haven't followed that.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.560
This is also called us lazy,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.760
loading off components.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.150
There are many mechanisms to do that.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.860
In fact,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.180
in the EC master of standards itself,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.150
it is proposed that we can have a lazy loading off modules.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.260
Number six.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.840
The site works Cross browser Now.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.230
This was one of the nightmares for any JavaScript developers.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.980
In the past,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.760
however,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.380
we have been using something called JSX,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.040
which is not even a JavaScript at all.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.690
So our actual JavaScript XML doesn't run on the browser behind the scene.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.170
There is a tool called the back during the build process our entire application got

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.740
converted into a format called ES five format,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.830
which works seamlessly in any browser,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.260
including the older washings off Internet Explorer off course.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.750
We would like to keep a benchmark off.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.680
I eat 10 and ever.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.480
However,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:15.980
if you want,

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.450
you can also compile your court toe the older Russians off years such as ES four as well,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.210
so we don't generally do that,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.550
but it is a possibility because we're using the Rear Jess application.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.020
Our application is automatically a cross browser application.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:38.780
Number seven bigs transitions don't feel like they block on the Internet.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.520
Now.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.540
This is automatically a chilled.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.140
When we created our single page application,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.910
you can see that our application doesn't actually lured,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.830
are reaping the whole page when we move from one Ling Tau.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.150
Another on this is all because of the single page application.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.810
In addition to that one of the strength off the AG Jess is working with Watch Ildem.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:07.330
So the World Children is a smaller foot print off a copy or a replica off the rial dom.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:13.010
So all the operations happen over there without having toe render the U I on.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.000
Once there is a really requirement off changing the the world chilled,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.190
um,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.180
is synchronized to the real dumb on.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.850
Only the changes would be deflected over there,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.600
making our application very much like a desktop like one.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.790
So because of the obvious,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:36.470
the point number seven is a holiday addressed on the last one says Each page has a you are

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.470
.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.520
Even though we are working with a single bed obligation,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.330
we still have different Urals toe.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.230
Identify different components off our application.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.780
For example,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.270
this is a urine for the homepage.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.470
But as if I'm searching for a movie here on,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.020
you can see that this is a Europe that I can just share to someone,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.090
and they can just open their browser and then go to the link,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.480
and they should see the exact same content as I.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.380
Similarly,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.670
if I am taking on one of the movie,

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.060
you'll see that there is a urine for that also.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.980
And if I shared this year up to someone and they can access that,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.100
you are and see the exact same result as what I see here.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.950
So every page has a distinct Ural that can be put.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.750
Mart are shared to someone else.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.050
And that is what actually the point number eight off PW is all about.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.850
So that's all for this lecture.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.940
In the subsequent lectures,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.360
let's convert our application into a progressive Web obligation step by step.
