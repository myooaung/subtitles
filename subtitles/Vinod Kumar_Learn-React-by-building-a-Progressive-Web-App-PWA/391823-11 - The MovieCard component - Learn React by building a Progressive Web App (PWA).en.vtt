00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.100
Let's create a movie called That displays a single movie on its title,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.460
probably along with an ear.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.790
A call.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.750
The layout is something that looks like this year is an example from a website called Big

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.710
basket dot com,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.760
where you can see a picture.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050
Some details about that and some call to action buttons over here.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.480
So this if I have,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.060
I can repeat the same thing for multiple movies.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.180
And that is the reason why I wanted to pick up the card.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.450
Lay out on the car load can be created easily,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.410
using the bootstrap CSS framework so I can go toe my documentation over here and they look

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.300
for called on.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.840
You can see that there is a bunch of options that pop up.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.070
I think cards Onda.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.780
Now I get the documentation for the cars over here,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.370
So bootstrap out of the box,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.290
just making use of some dues on some built in CSS last names.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.520
All those is to create an image Onda.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.410
Right below that there is a car title,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.510
and then there is a bunch off description.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.700
Some call to action.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.670
In all cases,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.710
the contruction probably need not be dead because I can click on this entire card anywhere

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.510
to get the details off the same movie.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.420
So we have here deal class off card.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.080
They're the style that is given here,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.680
which is fixing the week to be some 18 rdm.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.680
We want this to be automatically calculated based on our role column combination.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.690
But for the time being,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.350
let's keep that with us.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.830
You can see that there.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.990
Then I am G SRC equals two.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.380
And then there is a class name off called AMG Top.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.040
We can slap that along with this toe in to change the image and the the readable traction

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.860
off your car if you want.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.380
Basically,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.130
that's what we want.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.670
So we want to create a dude that has a card as a class name.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.190
I am G with called AMG Top,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.570
and then we have a card body with a car title and call text.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.310
So let's go back to our visual studio code.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.750
Onda clear A new component under Components folder On this time,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.160
I'm gonna call this US movie called Dart J six Andi.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.630
This is also going to be a function based on stateless component as much as possible.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.100
We would like toa a wild the state full components on.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.630
That's a good practice because state means data instead of keeping the later in the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.340
component,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.850
we can externalize that toe some other stores.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.350
That's where the concept off Redux our hooks comes into picture.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.850
So I'm gonna type your I am are forgetting the react from the act and then I'm gonna create

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.150
a constant movie card and that's gonna be my component.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.050
So I'm gonna assign an empty bracket on an adult function over here.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.670
Return a deal.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.700
Last name equals two.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.990
Card on slash.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.300
Do with a semicolon on,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.990
of course,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.040
export default movie card.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.450
So this is our actual movie card component.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.280
Since we want to display details of a movie here,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.500
let's create a variable called movie.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.290
So I'm gonna say,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.680
here const movie equals two and then I'm gonna grab one of the movie from here.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.960
So I've already selected from this country bracket toe the end of the curly bracket.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.450
I'm gonna copy that and then best as an object.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.810
Not that the whole thing is a Jason object over here with movie dark title,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.430
as I don't man moving out here to coordinate and so on and so forth.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.590
Now we want to make it off that over here,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.840
So I'm gonna have the i M g.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.470
SRC equals two and I want the movie,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.000
that poster to be the source.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.060
So since I want the value of a variable and not a hard coded string,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.320
I need to remove these double courts and then had a curly bracket.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.600
And then I'll say your movie dot We'll start like this.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.240
So we have a movie.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.040
We got the movie,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.880
that poster,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.550
and that becomes the source.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.700
We also have to give an alternate text as a good practice.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.380
So let's add the title as the alternate text.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.310
So I'm gonna remove this double course and then put a curly bracket.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.660
I'll say your movie dot title as the value for that importantly,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.000
it supposed to have a class name off card.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.470
I am G Top,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.140
and that's what actually,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.590
is the CSS class of yourself over here.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.530
Uranus on.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.150
Then we're gonna have a card body consisting off called Title and called the text.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.830
So let's adhere.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:01.250
A dot called body greater than card Titan plus called next.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.760
So I'm gonna press enter toe,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.890
have that structure.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.180
The car dictator.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.740
I just want the movie title.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.470
I'm just gonna copy this and then paste over here.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.210
This is gonna be just that year.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.720
So I'll just change this two year,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.550
so I'm gonna save this.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.300
But we never used this movie called anywhere.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.960
So for the time being,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.290
let's goto Abdur Js and then comment or remove this home for no.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.430
And then are here movie card song.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.130
I'll hear movie card slash.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.980
So we got a single movie card.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.220
So if I save this and go back to my application browser here,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.480
you can see that we got a big poster on the right at the bottom.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.650
We got the Iron Man and 2008.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.870
Now we wanted to have a smaller section.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.310
So that's where there was an initial wit was mentioned over here.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.620
You can see that there the will.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.330
Let me copy this for now and then change this later.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.750
So I go back toe movie card are a style along with this,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.450
like this.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.270
So if I save this and go back to the browser,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.780
go back to our application,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.390
you can see we got an editor.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:21.200
So the other here it says the style prop expects the mapping from style properties to

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.630
values,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.330
not a string.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.780
So this is a little strange because this is how we give it in html.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.250
But remember,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.970
this is an example on,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.760
but this is also special toe react Chase.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.320
What it's actually expecting here is an object,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.390
So assume that you have an object called S T.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.270
So it could be something like S T where the style object could be something like this

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.390
pattern on a width is a property,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.040
and then a value probably is,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.480
let's say,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.440
for example,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.010
200 PX or pixel.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.420
So this is an object,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.130
and that object is what we are giving over here.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.710
As soon as they save it and go back to the browser,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.970
you can see we got a movie like this Now,

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.480
obviously,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.140
we didn't want that to be having a fixed to it.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.290
We wanted toe.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.340
Make sure that we have a letter,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.190
for example,

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.570
for our three movies in one row,

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.970
so weaken tohave the row and column combination that we will do in the next lecture.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.730
So if I want to scrap the title along with the imager poster.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.150
So all you have to do is to bring this down,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.660
use the alky on Windows Option Key on Mac Onda,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.890
then pull down using the down arrow key,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.410
and you can see that we swept the called body along the card of image.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.540
That's also increased the weight off this tool.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.800
Say,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.420
250 pixel.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.740
Save this.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.340
Go back to the browser and,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.590
you know,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.060
see,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.160
the title is on the top,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.290
and then we have here the year and then we have the poster at the bottom,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.770
also to distinguish between the title and the year we can have here Hedge.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.310
Five.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:04.970
Instead,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.620
off it do you can give hits three hitch one.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.950
Whatever that suits best,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.450
go back and you can see its little bigger than the regular text.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.210
Also,

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.100
instead of just a deal I can make,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.080
this is a paragraph by adding a B instead of do.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.110
And that's what actually was recommended anywhere in the bootstrap documentation.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.070
So now we have our card.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.650
Really,

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.400
let's use the same thing to create a movie list component.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.090
So that's it for this lecture.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.210
See in the next one
