00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.560
Let's have a closer look at the manifesto chase on which is available over here on the

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.060
manifest.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.650
Our Jason follows is to customers our applications behavior on a mobile device.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.610
So here,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.540
the sharp name for our application Off course.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.570
This is definitely not the one that we want.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.020
We want to call this US movie browser the same name I can give it for the actual full name

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.490
also.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.290
So I'm gonna pay the same thing if you only can have a different name like MB four days and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.360
then movie Brazil.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.150
Over here,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.290
the different sets off icons required for applications are free,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.500
like under icy.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.780
Well,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.030
for all these worst,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.200
and it's going to use this.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.550
Now,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.110
remember,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.680
the favor icon is directly under our public folder.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.260
If I had copied them under a folder called Icons,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.270
then I have to give their absolute our lady apart from the public folder.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.220
In my case,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.970
it is there in the public folders.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm gonna leave that as it is,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.720
the 2nd 1 is a 1 92 by one and Ito file,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.750
which we now have a file called Android Dash Chrome Dash 1 92 by 1 92 that P and G,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.570
if you want,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.350
you can rename this itself as logo When 92 are You can add the name over here so I'm gonna

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.550
type this as on droid.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.570
That's chrome Dash 1 92 x 1 92 That's the name.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.190
A similar name is also given toe this logo fight Well,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.360
so let's say this is fight well,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.230
So now we have these two files updated.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.710
Our application is ready just before this.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.090
Let's also have a look at the index started.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.720
Html.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.760
So in the index.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.290
Alex Gemmell.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.970
If you'll see there is a link toe on Apple Touch Icon,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.870
we say there.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.350
Hey,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.380
wherever the public urine that happens to be on local host Colin 3000 are the one that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990
we're department fire base.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.980
So it's actual public Ural,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.680
and it takes logo 1 92 So that is what it is sticking.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.410
In our case,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.210
we have a separate file called Apple Touch.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.330
I conduct changes,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.110
so I have to change this one toe apple touch icon.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.470
So that's all the changes that were required to make.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.780
As far as icons are concerned in the next electoral,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.150
let enable our sorry Zwickel and see what it's capable off
