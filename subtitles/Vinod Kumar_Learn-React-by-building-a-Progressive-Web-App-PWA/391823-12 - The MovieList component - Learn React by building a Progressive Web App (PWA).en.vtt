00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.970
Welcome back in this lecture.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.750
Let's create a movie list component that has probably a bunch of movies as data and for

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.820
every way we want toe display a movie card,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.950
which we have created in the previous lecture.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.570
So to do the same thing,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.170
Let's go toe are we eh?

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.700
Scored.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.140
Create a new component under Components folder.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.670
Let's call it US movie list dot jsx on Let's Keep a class based component because we want

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.890
to maintain some data as a state here,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.230
I'm gonna type your I am RC toe,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.670
get,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.950
react and component from react and then type CCS to create a class based component so it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.780
bottles the name from the file name.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.320
That's where the name of the file is important.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.660
We give it in the proper Paschal casing here.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.350
This time we have the state.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.190
We're gonna call this US movies.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.310
Andi.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.800
Let's keep it simple array for this time and then in the rendered function.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.640
Let's return a simple day for the time being.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.970
Some will just add your deal slash day.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.390
Now,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.160
for the time being,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.530
let's copy and paste some hard coded values from the browser here,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.750
so we have the list off movies.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.050
All the movies that are there,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.520
I want the entire are over here.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240
So this squared back it to the end off it,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.510
Samuel a copy everything and then come back and then based over here.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.840
But eventually we want to get this data using a Jets,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.760
so we'll do that a bit later.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.520
So we got all the 10 movies in one single day object over here.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.400
So what I want is I want toe loop over this movie's Ari and for every movie inside the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.160
collection,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.090
I want to get one car.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.340
So the way we would probably think off doing it is okay.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.860
Let's adhere a section like this and then put a far loop are movies dot forage and then

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.720
convert each movie into a movie card.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.420
But the curly bracket here is not for JavaScript constructs like if conditions are far loop

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.420
.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.410
So the only thing that you can do is put some variables,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.350
which represents probably an area of JSX.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.200
So the way you can handle this situation is you have to use the movies dot map function.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.550
Movies.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.640
Being in a raid has a function called map that can convert an object in tow something else

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.770
and that something else would be a movie card component.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.230
So the way you do is you come here and then say this dot state dot movies,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.900
which is another.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.860
And then you say dot map map takes a call back where you will be getting a movie object,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.190
and in turn,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.210
you have toe return something else and that something else is gonna be a movie car.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.500
So I'm gonna type your movie card like this.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.960
So we get one movie.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.780
Onda.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.650
We are returning a movie car.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.990
So the map function since it is giving you one at a time,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.830
it's gonna collect this one at the time.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.270
At the end off it,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.380
it's going to return and a day off movie called Object.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.650
So map generally does the transformation,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.670
so I can call this as a variable here,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.230
for example,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.920
I can say const movie list equals to something like this,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.900
so I can not copy this on.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.400
Then give that inside this particular curly bracket.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.720
So the tally black.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.290
It is an expression now,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.250
so it represents a variable,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.780
and the variable is nothing but an array off movie cards.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.820
So why this is what you have to do?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.050
In effect?

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.070
There is one more thing that we have to do.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.800
We have to supply this movie object to this movie card so that the movie card can display

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.680
that details.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.090
We'll do that in a minute just to make sure that we get this properly done.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.520
Let's also have a class name off row here on Let's go to the movie card component,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.600
which is here.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.730
Let's get it off the style.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.350
We don't need this style anymore,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.550
but instead we're gonna surround the whole thing in another deal with a column.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.600
So I'm gonna take your do last name equals to call Dash MD Dash.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.560
Let's say I want toe three movies in a row so I can say here,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.180
Dash four on,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.110
then slash do on inside that,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.650
I'm gonna paste the whole thing.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.930
If you want a former the court here,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.580
you can press all shifted on Windows Option Shift F on Mac and the court gets formatted

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.300
like this.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.100
So save this card movie list has been saved already.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.690
But movie list has never been used anywhere,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.160
so I'm gonna go toe Abdur Js on,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.080
remove the movie card on instead off that I'm gonna put the movie list before that.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.540
Let's also add a class off container,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.690
so that's gonna give you the fixed to it.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:12.110
And since this is not a dog JSX type manually do last name equals toe container on inside

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.350
that I'm gonna type your movie list component.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.160
So as soon as the save this and if I go back to the browser good,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.020
our application,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.090
you can see that I have 10 movies.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.580
And for every movie,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.090
the Iron Man movies is being repeatedly being displayed.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.520
Of course,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.070
what we want to do now is Toe Pass,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.420
the unusual movie in the A tow.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.300
The movie called Soma We Card can grab that information and then present the same thing

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.060
over here.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.150
So that's it for this movie list component.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.750
In the next lecture,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.450
let's see how we can pass the value from movie list to movie car
