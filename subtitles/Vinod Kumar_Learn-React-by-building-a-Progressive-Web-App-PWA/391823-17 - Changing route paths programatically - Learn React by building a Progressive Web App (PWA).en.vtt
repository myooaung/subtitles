00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.660
Welcome back now that we're able to get the list off movies based on the search text as a

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.400
query String perimeter over here.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.870
Now let us see how to supply the same thing from the text box over here,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.400
which is inside the header component.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.320
So let's go back to the header competent over here,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.920
which is headed RJ six.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.280
And the first thing that we want to do is to surround this particular input text box with a

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.120
form element.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.130
So I'm gonna break it down in multiple lines so it becomes easy for us,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.550
toe.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.810
I understand.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.080
I'm gonna add a form,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.140
and then we say here on submit equals toe a function that we want toe right inside.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.550
This particular class will come back for that in a minute.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.250
And the slash phone will be after the input,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.510
not literally of function inside this header class over here and then use the same thing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.840
inside this submit handler Onda.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.720
We can probably call this a submit handler itself on.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.310
I'm gonna write a function which is a regular,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.540
jealous good function and we will see what is the problem with that and then re factor the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.260
same thing in tow and at a function.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.760
So first,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.060
I'm ready function called submit handler,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.750
which is a function.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.870
And that's supposed to take an event object because we're gonna ascended to an event

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.130
handler over here on.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.280
The first thing that I want to do is to whenever you submit this particular form,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.100
it tries to navigate to a different your elinda address bar.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700
So we want to cancel the effect.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.550
So we want to say every t dot prevent default.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.540
So the default behavior off form submission is cancelled on for the time being.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.040
I'm just going to type your console dot long.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.930
Andi,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.790
I'll say here,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.970
this is and I print the keyword this itself.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.300
One last thing is that we have to assign this function toe the on submit event handler here

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.300
,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.960
and that can be done by typing.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.310
Here.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.260
They start submit handler.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.270
No,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.280
it is that I'm not calling the function.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.890
I'm just giving the name of the function here.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.860
So whenever you take something in the search box here,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.830
interest enter,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.800
it is equal enough form submission and that time react.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.460
Jess is supposed to call this function by supplying the event object.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.470
And then we're calling the vendor to prevent default,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.420
which cancels the form submission.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690
And then I'm just getting the console out.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.560
Log over here.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.190
So let's say this.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.730
Go back to the browser now.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.390
I'm going to type your island man.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.750
Press,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.090
enter on.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.640
Now you can see it says here,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.750
this is undefined.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.230
So we're able to come to the header George a six lane number seven.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.490
But it says here this is undefined.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.870
Now The reason for this is when this function is created here.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.690
It's a regular jobless good function.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.050
And when it is in Nord,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.770
it is involved from the farms perspective.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.870
So it is just treated as a global function in the global context.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.180
There is no cure called this and hence we're getting this better.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.800
So to solve this problem,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.370
we have to tell reactors that hate dysfunction whenever it's called,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.310
is always supposed to be called in the context of the class leader.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.180
Now,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.140
for this you may have to raid a constructor.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.180
There are two approaches.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.520
The first approach inwards rating a constructor.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.150
And since our class extends another class,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.550
you always must call the super Plus constructor and then We're going to stay here.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.950
They start submit handler equals toe this dark submit handler dot Bind off this.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.430
Now this looks like a complicated statement,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.650
but it's pretty simple.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.530
We're actually binding the keyword days and not that inside the constructor.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.920
This represents an object of Heather class and we bind that object with the distorts of mid

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.370
handler.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.010
And then we're assigning toe the start 700 again.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.440
Which means when we are assigning this dark submit angler here,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.460
it has been tightly bound with the disc e were which means it is bound with the header

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.650
component itself.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.530
So if I save this now and then,

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.650
go back to the browser and it's reloaded now and I'm gonna type here once again Iron Man

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.530
and press enter.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.600
And now we can see it comes back with.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.400
This is an object off header class on headache loss has got props,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.960
context reps and few other properties I have explained over here against the props is an

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.960
empty objects that this is under the problem that we have to address because we don't have

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.650
the routing information here.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.990
So now let's see what is the second alternate to this The second alternative is a very

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.880
simple mechanism,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.840
so I don't need to write any off these things,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.760
but simply assigned this to an adult function and the job is done.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.750
So now we see that we have submit handler,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.480
which is their property of this class.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.140
But it's an arrow function out of functions automatically,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.330
as in the this skewer with the function except that we don't have to really do a binding.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.470
So the binding takes place automatically.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.690
So I saved this.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.630
Go back to the browser again and then notice that it's been reloaded.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.070
So I'm gonna type your say,

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.440
Spiderman press enter and you can see I get the exact same output without having to go

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.560
through the constructor and binding off this keyword with a function.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.880
The second problem is now the props doesn't carry any things right.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.350
No props is an empty object.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.950
We wanted the props to contain history Location editor.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.070
Now,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.160
in the previous case,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.190
we saw that it was automatically added,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.150
but this time it was not so.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.940
What we do now is we would now import something called with rotor,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.440
which is a function from reactor Oto Dam.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.460
So I'm going to say your import from react rotor don on What we want to import is a

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.810
function called us with the rotor And all I have to do is to use this with rotor function

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.390
toe past this header class.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.060
So if you carefully observe,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.770
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call a function called with rotor here by supplying the

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.010
class on the return value itself is another components.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.740
In other words,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.600
we're supplying a component here toe with rotor,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.850
which returns Another component,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.310
in fact,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.850
had written the same component with either benefits.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.940
Now this kind of functions are called higher order component.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.420
So a higher order component is simply a function that takes a component and treatments and

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.850
altered component.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.370
So let's save this.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.990
Go back to the browser Once again,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.280
you can see that it's been refreshed.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.060
I'm gonna type,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.440
say island press enter on this time you can tell that the props is not an empty object.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.020
It contains history,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.710
location,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.310
match,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.460
etcetera on our history.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.140
Now we have a bunch of functions like street are going.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.540
We want to make use of this function called push.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.030
And when we call his student push with a new location that automatically tells react that

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.430
we want to change the location off your application.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.800
So because the location conveys the part information automatically,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.360
the roads will be updated before we proceed.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.920
For there,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.570
we will have a look at one more member off the disc.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.590
Keyword here are the object of other component.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.270
Now,

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.090
apart from this dark props,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.300
there is also another attribute,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.120
or property called this dot refs,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.770
which is currently empty.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.640
Now the refs property off a component correspond toe.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.180
Any HTML element,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.680
which is referenced using and a kind of an i d since react,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.440
is refering to something called virtual dominant,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.560
not the reald on.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.680
We can't use that get element by 80 because get element by idea the function off Don a p a

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:04.680
,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.350
which works in a real down and you don't want actually react toe talk to the real dung all

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.720
the times because that's the whole idea.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.120
Off charges which it wants toe a wider talking to the real dumb.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.640
So in orderto rougher toe the elements which is inside the virtual dom,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.250
we can give an idee toe any of these elements but not using the idea to but something

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.240
called reputable.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.650
So I'm going to say here ref equals toe.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.560
Let's say for example,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.520
I colored eyes Search DF for search text field Save this.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.220
Go back to the browser on tape.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.930
Something here?

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.930
Doesn't matter what it ISS and press enter.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.470
Look at what is the refs,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.730
right.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.910
Gnomic refs is an object that has one property called search TF,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.310
which is nothing more than input element.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.520
So then that element is what we have got over here now.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.670
Had I given toe Do for example,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.770
I can say you're left equals toe say d one on.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.360
But now I have a d one has another left.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.790
So if I go back over here and type some is depressed center you can see now refs correspond

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.560
toe to attributes.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.950
One is search TF Onda de one,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.580
which is a deal.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.640
So any html element you want,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.950
you can access them using the refs.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.070
So let's go back.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.590
Get it off.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.980
That difficult to d one.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.850
We don't need that.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:29.180
What now we will do is we will get it off this and we're gonna extract two things from the

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.900
props.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.420
Let history as a less refs equals toe distort prompts.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:35.840
Basically,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.920
we are extracting these two attributes from this particular props into a local variable.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.570
So I can see here now history dot push and we need to give a new location,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.860
which is movies.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.470
Caution,

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.040
mark search.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.630
Txt equals toe And then we have to say,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.880
Plus,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.650
refs don't search DF because this is the ref that we have here.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.490
Search TF.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.350
But that's an ender Textbooks.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.730
We just want the value from that on.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.990
We just give a value like this.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.180
So now we are actually passing something toe history.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:18.160
That push and remember history came because of the routing and the browser rotor were using

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.640
will revalued all the roads and one of the route in our app dot Js If you see matches that

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.960
part Onda now that component will be the movie list component and not the home component.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.760
So that's what it's supposed to happen.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.970
So let's go check this out.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.850
Let's save it.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:40.900
But let's just go toe the homepage so that we see the change in the home component over

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.350
here.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.050
Now let me take Spider Man and see what happens.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.920
Andi,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.050
I see an edit.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.660
Here it is.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.880
Search TF off.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.560
Undefined on.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.560
That's probably because search TF east from refs.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.650
That is correct.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.290
But reps is not coming from the start.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.700
Props.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.320
Rex is coming directly from there,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.420
so I don't need to give this year on.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.890
I can directly type your this.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.730
Start rough.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.420
Start searched yifter value.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.110
So our Ural effectively is going to be a slash movies.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.040
Caution,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.050
Mark search.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.650
This is supposed to be text,

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:20.030
so slash More discussion about search text equals toe this start up start associative dot

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.280
valley,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.620
which would be Spider Man.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.400
So I'm gonna say this Go back to the browser.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.710
So we are on the home page.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.390
I'm gonna type your spider man again and pressed.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:28.880
Enter.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.630
And obviously we got the movies that have Spiderman in the title.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.130
While this looks like it's working,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.830
we may have one small issue with this toe.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.700
See the same Let's go and change this vitamin toe.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.150
Let's say,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.110
for example,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.910
Iron Man and press enter and I will see it's changing on the adjust bar,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.270
but I don't see that effect over here.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.970
The rial reason for this is nothing to do with the header dot JSX here,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.880
headed out Your sex is perfectly all right.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.350
You're changing this.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:05.020
But that change in the pot is not changing the actual company.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.770
So this is a problem with the browser rotor,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.290
because by default,

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.770
it looks at this component and say,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:10.880
Hey,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.740
there's no change in the part,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.760
not the values,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.660
because this is an additional information related to the part.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.080
But it only looks at the partners they had.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.290
Slash movies has changed to slash Mori's,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.650
which means I don't have to really replace the component.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.790
But what we want to say is that we want to say that there is a change in the properties

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.280
that were supplying over here.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.490
So because there is a change in the properties off this movies,

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.970
even though the component itself is the same,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.660
we want toe rear end of the components.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.890
That is what we want to tell.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.200
React Chase.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.000
To do that,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.110
let's go back to our movie list component where we are trained.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.260
Toe affects the movies,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.240
but the fetch move it happened only during the component did amount on the component

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.130
mounted is not changed when slash movies has changed from slash movies to slash more with

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.570
itself.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.760
So in order to tell react Jess Toe really under the component to during that change in the

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.270
props,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.280
let's add one more lifecycle function over here,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.850
which is called Component Did update on this is going toe,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:16.060
get the previous properties and we have access to the current crops.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.780
Also,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.200
we want to check if the previous props is any different than the current props,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.780
then called the fetch movies once again.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.880
So we're gonna just type your if they start drops,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.930
start location is not equals.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:31.350
Two,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:39.580
three props the previously received props and it has location attribute if it is not the

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.390
same automatically,

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.070
we want to change.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.960
You know the location includes not only slash movies,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.610
but it also includes the question mark.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.130
Search text equals two and its value.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.830
So since the previously it was Spiderman and currently desire in man.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.220
So there is a change.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.580
So I'll have to do is to call,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.150
distort,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.930
fetch movies.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:57.710
Once again,

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.560
Andi,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.730
that's all we have to do.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.570
Nothing else that save this.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.890
Go back to the browser.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.920
We're getting the Iron Man over here on day.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.790
Let's just type your heart and percenter and you see,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.120
we are getting so let's just type your Avengers on.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.250
Both enter and we see all Avenger movies.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.170
Aan incident.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.530
May I see a warning?

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.480
Over here it is encountered two Children with the same key,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.600
PT.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.350
Whatever this number on,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.390
I believe that's probably because it's giving me the same movies.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.380
Avengers Endgame twice.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.780
And this is not my issue.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.710
The issue is from the When did the FBI So it has given the same movie twice?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.470
Don't know why,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.940
but since that is the issue and we won't really addressed that,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.890
what I can do it,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:52.640
I can go back to my movie star Chase X 22 which is in here notice that we are supplying

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.180
keys equal toe m dot i am D V I T.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.100
That is the reason why we're getting the problem.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.450
What I can do that can replace this with a index.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:01.780
Let's say,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.340
for example,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.480
there's gonna be index.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.270
But indexing is the other index that I get because of the map function,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.810
so I may have toe ask for not only M,

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.830
but also the index.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.780
Now that problem should not be there because we're not using the IMDb idea because it's

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.390
getting duplicated for some reason.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.140
So if I go back to the browser,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.670
you see that we have the same duplicate movies.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.790
But I don't have the warning that I got uglier now just to check.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.400
Once again,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.030
if things are working properly,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.920
let's go and type your mask.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.490
Press enter on.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.190
We got the list off movies with Mosque in their title.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.580
That's it for this lecture in the next lecture ality how clicking this particular movie

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.500
brother title takes me back toe the home component.
