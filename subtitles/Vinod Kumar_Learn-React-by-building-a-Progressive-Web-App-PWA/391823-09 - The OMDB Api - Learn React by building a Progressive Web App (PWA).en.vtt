00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.090
Welcome back.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.110
Since our application is about movies,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.280
we want to display data related toe movies that the user is going to search.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.020
We need the data from an external source,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.870
which has the up to date information about movies.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.500
And there is an 80 I called boy I m D B a P I.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.440
So visit the website called William D.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.560
B a ph dot com,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.060
and you will be landed over here on this particular AP.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.760
I can give you various information about a movie that you are looking for,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.260
and this has got a couple of usage information.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.110
For example,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.530
I can just send this request Hitz TV people and www 0.0 mdb aviator com slash a p a ki

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.640
equals toe your a p a key.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.350
So you need toe acquired an a p a key first.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.650
Once you got dizzy,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.050
can put this one person and then you sir and perimeters toe get details.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.480
For example.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.460
You can use this.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.960
I toe get the movie information based on the imdb i d are.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.640
You can use their t based on the movie title.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.010
Now this is going to give you a single movie in case.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.210
If you're using the perimeter,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.880
I Then of course,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.900
you're giving an imdb i d.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.560
Which is a specific idea for a specific movie.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950
There's an exact match or no match.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.600
But if you give a title,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.650
then probably the first best match to movie will be returned for.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340
But because if you're searching for a bunch off them,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.050
then you use the perimeter called s and then give the search keyword that you're looking

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.450
for.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.990
For example,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.320
here,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.660
If I had said that T equals Toe Island,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.030
then I would ago the first best match for the world island in the title.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.270
So probably an Iron Man,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.250
whichever the release.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.540
However,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.740
by using this s equals Toe Island,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.370
I will get the 1st 2 10 best matched movie list.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.870
And of course,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.050
if you want more,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.750
you can get a different page by typing the page number.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.160
Some examples over here so you can search for a movie.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.200
This is by title.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.000
If I type here island and then click on search,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.380
I should get only one single movie probably that did not match particular movies.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.550
I'm gonna type your island man and then click on search.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.670
You can see that we got response consisting off the title Iron Man over here.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.020
Whereas if I give Island Space Man,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.290
I would get probably a different movie,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.250
which contains the world or the phrase Iron Man.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.420
In the title here,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.320
I'm only going to get a single visit.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.760
The best way to explore this is toe.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.550
Get your own AP a key and then get the details off the movies that you want.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.980
That's it for this lecture.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.120
In the next lecture,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.550
let's obtain a 80 a key for ourselves.
