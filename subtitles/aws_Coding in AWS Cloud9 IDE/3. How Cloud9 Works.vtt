00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.140
Cloud9, or any IDE really, has three primary objectives.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.160
These objectives are to allow developers to write,

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.070
run,

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.730
and debug code in the most efficient way possible. When writing code

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.110
with Cloud9, you have a full suite of features that make the cloud

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.660
development experience as seamless as possible while providing you

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.140
features that maximize your productivity.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.240
Features like code hinting and code completion make it feel just as

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.740
if you were coding directly on your own machine.

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.760
Pre‑packaged execution abilities within Cloud9 allow you to quickly

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.040
run your code for common programming languages,

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.210
such as Node.js, Python, and C#. Run configurations often work

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.460
out of the box, but remain flexible to allow developers to

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.640
customize them to meet their needs.

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.990
An integrated debugger allows a developer to pause code execution

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.990
in their browser and step through their code line by line by

17
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.140
analyzing local variables and call stacks.

18
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.450
This enables faster debugging of issues,

19
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.700
resulting in more resilient code and faster velocity for creating new features.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.540
So you may be wondering, how does Cloud9 work exactly?

21
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.380
Well, at the highest level,

22
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.880
use a computer, literally any computer, and you access AWS via a

23
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.400
URL in the browser. From there, Cloud9 runs on a virtual machine,

24
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.260
typically an EC2 instance, and integrates with CodeCommit for

25
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.440
saving your code in source control.

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.960
The seamless integration from Cloud9 to other AWS services is one of

27
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.440
the main selling points for leveraging it as an IDE.

28
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.640
I want to know, this is just an example,

29
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910
and you can actually change your Cloud9 architecture

30
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.130
to meet your needs, for example,

31
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.540
you can actually run Cloud9 with your own server not hosted on AWS,

32
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.650
and you can integrate it with any source control platform,

33
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.910
such as GIt. Before we dive into Cloud9, there are a few

34
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.240
prerequisite requirements we need to do beforehand.

35
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.130
Foremost,

36
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.560
we need an AWS user that we can access the AWS console

37
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.530
with. Preferably, this is not the root user of our account

38
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.140
for various security reasons.

39
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.510
Then, we need to provision an EC2 instance to run Cloud9 or establish

40
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.240
an SSH connection to our own server to run Cloud9.

41
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.440
If this sounds intimidating, don't worry,

42
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.910
because Cloud9 can automatically provision EC2 instances

43
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.120
for us, unless we prompt otherwise.

44
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.930
Lastly, we need a Cloud9 IAM role.

45
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.290
This will allow Cloud9 to have sufficient access to other resources. If

46
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.910
you're unfamiliar with identity and access management, or IAM,

47
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.570
don't worry,

48
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.310
we will cover it at a high level as it pertains to Cloud9 in

49
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.410
this course. The Cloud9 environment we create will have a few

50
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.760
customization options for us,

51
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.330
including a name and description, auto‑hibernation mode,

52
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.280
which I highly recommend, since it provides significant cost savings.

53
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.160
This essentially means that when you're not using Cloud9,

54
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.040
it will terminate the EC2 instance it runs on, so you're only paying for the

55
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.140
service and compute power while you're actively using it.

56
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.000
And there's also some additional configurations we can leverage, which we will get to later in this course.
