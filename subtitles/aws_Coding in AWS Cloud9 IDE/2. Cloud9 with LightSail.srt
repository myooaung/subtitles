00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,320
AWS Lightsail has an easy‑to‑use user interface for quickly

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,400
bringing solutions to life within AWS.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,290
Lightsail is the easiest way to get a project in AWS up and running.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,360
You can launch a virtual server in Lightsail within

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,580
minutes that provides compute power and other useful

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,640
features for running a project in AWS.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,550
Lightsail has a concept called blueprints,

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,490
which are essentially software packages you can have preinstalled

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,640
and configured into your Lightsail environment.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,810
With blueprints,

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,790
you can easily create Lightsail environments with software preinstalled,

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,440
such as Drupal or WordPress.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,540
These solutions can be used to make websites on AWS with no coding required.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,770
Blueprints can also be used to add stacks to your Lightsail environment,

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,900
such as Node.js, or NGINX,

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,210
or even Django so that your environment has software

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,810
preinstalled and you can quickly begin coding.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,240
Lightsail environments can be linked to Cloud9 instances so that

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,900
developers can create their Lightsail environments in the cloud and

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,590
then use Cloud9's IDE with all of its enhanced features to change code

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,140
directly on the Lightsail instance.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,870
This approach is very fast,

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,120
and I recommend leveraging Cloud9 in Lightsail when you need to

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,310
get an application in AWS running quickly with minimal

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,750
infrastructure or administrative overhead.

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,340
The architecture for Lightsail with Cloud9 is fairly simplistic.

27
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,240
From a high level, users access AWS from their personal computer.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,780
Then, within their browser, they can use Cloud9 to read,

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,840
write, and debug code as demonstrated before.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,640
From there,

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,020
users can create a Lightsail environment with a preconfigured blueprint and

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,770
link Cloud9 to the environment so that they can leverage the Cloud9 IDE to

33
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,030
code directly on their Lightsail instance.

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,740
It really is that easy.

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,040
However, there are some tradeoffs you make when using AWS Lightsail.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,150
Obviously, the benefit is its ease of use.

37
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,160
However, because of this, as a user,

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,490
you have far less power for customization and control over

39
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,830
your environment when using Lightsail.

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,950
Lightsail is abstracting many AWS services away from you,

41
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,640
such as EC2, IAM, and CloudFormation.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,410
Using these services directly will provide more granular

43
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,090
control to you as a user; however,

44
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,980
using Lightsail will make it much faster to provision private

45
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,940
servers that can host applications in the cloud.

46
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,250
My recommendation would be to use Lightsail if you are new to AWS

47
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,340
or strongly want to minimize the amount of time spent

48
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,620
provisioning services within the AWS console.

49
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,310
In my experience, enterprise applications are rarely created using Lightsail,

50
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,740
but that's not to say it isn't possible.

51
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,500
It's important to understand the tradeoffs of using Lightsail

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,220
before you decide using it over a different service.

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,340
Lightsail is very easy and fast to use.

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:11,000
If that's extremely important to you, then Lightsail may be the way to go. It's typically something you have to evaluate on a use‑case‑by‑use‑case basis.
