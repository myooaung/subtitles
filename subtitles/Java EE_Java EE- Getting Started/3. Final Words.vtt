00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.553
This finishes this Java EE Getting Started course.

2
00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:07.934
Congratulations, you've made it.

3
00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:12.910
You've completed the journey throughout the basics of Java EE.

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.311
But the road is not finished.

5
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:20.681
Java EE was created in 1998, it grew throughout the versions,

6
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:23.188
and addresses many architectural styles.

7
00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:28.354
Therefore, you can imagine that there is so much more to learn.

8
00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:33.900
The good news is that there are plenty of references out there on Java EE,

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.575
from beginning to higher level articles,

10
00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:41.320
technical blogs, business analysis and so on.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.785
But always remember to read the Java EE specifications on the JCP website.

12
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:54.588
Version 7 of the enterprise application is described in the JSR 342 at the JCP.

13
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.545
org website.

14
00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:59.683
Same for Angular, even if the technology is younger.

15
00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:03.229
There are many references out there and I recommend

16
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.848
the Angular tutorial on the Angular.

17
00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:09.387
io website.

18
00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:14.407
In terms of books, it's shamelessly that I do some advertising here.

19
00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:19.974
I've written a few books, including an entire one on Java EE 7.

20
00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:25.448
It is a technical book and it covers most of the Java EE specifications.

21
00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:27.646
It's an easy step by step book to follow,

22
00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:34.227
you should check it out, as well as my author page at Amazon.

23
00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.091
And of course,

24
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.683
you can always check other Pluralsight courses if you

25
00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:40.605
need to dig into more technical detail.

26
00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:45.005
This Java EE Getting Started course is very code focused.

27
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.844
It takes you from a white page to a complete web application.

28
00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:54.237
You can then attend the Java EE 7 Fundamentals course,

29
00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:59.203
which gives you an intermediate level on Java EE by

30
00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.592
introducing most of the Java EE specifications.

31
00:02:02.592 --> 00:02:03.556
Less technical,

32
00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.686
you have the Java EE Big Picture course that will focus

33
00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:10.098
on the business analysis of Java EE.

34
00:02:10.098 --> 00:02:14.428
Check it out if you want to understand if Java EE is

35
00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:16.874
suited for your project or not.

36
00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:19.321
If you want more technical knowledge,

37
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.728
you can now bridge the other Java EE specifications.

38
00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:28.120
Pluralsight has dedicated course on Java Persistence API,

39
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.471
Bean Validation, Context and Dependency Injection,

40
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:37.664
WebSockets, Web Technology, or RESTful Web Services.

41
00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:43.008
Just go to the Pluralsight website and look for courses on Java EE.

42
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.172
I've created a few myself, but there is much more than these ones.

43
00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:50.122
Give it a try.

44
00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:52.867
This course was mainly about Java EE while

45
00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:54.741
considering Angular for the front-end.

46
00:02:54.741 --> 00:03:01.109
I didn't cover Angular much, but Pluralsight has great content on Angular,

47
00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.507
from the Getting Started course to Angular Fundamentals.

48
00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:10.343
And then you can dive into Angular Routing,

49
00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:16.529
Forms, Reactive Forms, Angular CLI or End-to-end.

50
00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:21.245
As you can see, there are quite a few courses on the Pluralsight website.

51
00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:26.205
But make sure to look for courses on Angular version 2 upwards.

52
00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:32.168
Angular 1 was very different from what you saw in this course.

53
00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:34.729
It's all up to you now.

54
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.144
This ends this Java EE Getting Started course.

55
00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:41.450
I hope you enjoyed taking this course and more important

56
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.946
have learned a lot about this technology.

57
00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:54.000
I hope you'll be able to take Java EE into your projects. Thanks for attending, bye.
