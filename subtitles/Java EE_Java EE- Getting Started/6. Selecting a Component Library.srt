1
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:07,454
In terms of tool related to coding, we could stop the list here.

2
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:11,169
But we want our bookstore web application to have a user

3
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,965
interface with beautiful components.

4
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:18,999
We could, of course, build our own, but this is not the topic of this course,

5
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:21,916
so we will reuse existing component libraries.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:28,768
Material Design has been created in 2014 to have responsive animation,

7
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,050
transition, padding, and all the visual effects such as lighting and shadows.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,125
There is actually a Material Design extension for Angular.

9
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:43,184
Another famous library is PrimeNG.

10
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:49,410
Historically is comes from the Java world and is named PrimeFaces.

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,187
All the PrimeFaces components have been migrated to work with Angular,

12
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:58,985
so PrimeNG is one of the richest component libraries at the moment

13
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:03,683
and of course comes Twitter Bootstrap or Bootstrap.

14
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:09,790
It is the component library we will be using for the bookstore web application.

15
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,598
Bootstrap is a free and open source front-end web framework

16
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:16,628
for designing websites and web applications.

17
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:21,261
It contains HTML and CSS based design templates,

18
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:26,974
but also forms patterns, navigation, and other graphical components.

19
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:32,235
As you've seen from the very first demo of the bookstore web application,

20
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:34,361
it is a simple web application,

21
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:42,170
so we will only be using a subset of the Bootstrap components.

22
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,525
I'll be using Bootstrap 4 which is still in alpha at the moment,

23
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:47,989
but shouldn't take long to be final.

24
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:51,957
If you want to add more graphical components to the

25
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:55,470
bookstore web application or make it prettier,

26
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:05,000
do not hesitate to browse the documentation and discover all the possibilities of Bootstrap.
