00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:06,090
There are several editors that support Java EE APIs,

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,233
either out of the box or after installing a few plug-ins.

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:16,233
Some people use basic text editors such as Vi or Emacs,

4
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:20,778
and add a bunch of plug-ins so they get extra functionalities.

5
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:27,869
These two editors are quite basic and you can go for something richer,

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,233
such as Atom and add the right plug-ins.

7
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:35,233
But keep in mind that your developer's experience will be more pleasant

8
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:39,848
if you use an editor that fully understands Java EE,

9
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:43,415
such as Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA.

10
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:49,376
For this course I'm using IntelliJ IDEA, but it's purely a personal choice.

11
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:56,233
Feel free to use the IDE you feel more comfortable with.

12
00:00:56,233 --> 00:01:01,233
IntelliJ IDEA runs on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.

13
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:07,233
It supports both Java EE and Angular, adding code completion and refactoring,

14
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:12,618
of course, but also more advanced ones such as refactoring persistence queries,

15
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:13,387
for instance.

16
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:17,900
IntelliJ IDEA brings support for most of the Java EE APIs,

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,233
including Java persistence API, context and dependency injection,

18
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,900
transaction, and REST.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,233
It also supports several testing frameworks,

20
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:33,233
including the one we'll be using, JUnit and Arquillian.

21
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:36,662
If you want to use IntelliJ IDEA with all these great features,

22
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:39,156
you will have to buy a license.

23
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,233
But you can also use the community edition,

24
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:47,233
which is free, but it includes less functionality.

25
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,150
Here is the website of IntelliJ IDEA.

26
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,541
IntelliJ has a Java background, but as you can see here,

27
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:59,376
under the Download button, it is actually much more than just Java.

28
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:03,869
If we scroll down the website, we see several features,

29
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,869
the most interesting ones is the building tools and supported frameworks.

30
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:19,633
Here you can see that IntelliJ IDEA supports Java EE as well as Angular.

31
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:23,233
And that's exactly what we want.

32
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,033
But as I said,

33
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,733
you are free to use whichever editor you want or feel more comfortable with.

34
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:42,000
If you want to use IntelliJ IDEA, take a few moments to install it. Now that we've selected our editor, let's select our building tool.
