Hi everyone, my name is Antonio Goncalves.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,750
Welcome to my course Java EE: Getting Started.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,818
I am independent developer, a book author,

4
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:17,818
and a recognized Java champion, living in beautiful Paris.

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:23,000
But I also travel the world speaking at various conferences.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So you want to get started with Java EE, sounds like the right course.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,667
In this course you will build a Java EE back-end and

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,800
then add an Angular front-end to it.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,133
And when I say build,

10
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:42,000
I mean that you will spend most of your time in front of your IDE typing code.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,077
Some of the major topics that I will cover include

12
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:46,889
setting up your development environment,

13
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:51,538
which IDE to choose, which building tools or database to install,

14
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:56,636
which server to run your code, or which testing frameworks to use.

15
00:00:56,636 --> 00:01:01,000
Then you will build a Java EE back-end.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,143
This means that you will map domain objects to a database

17
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:07,800
and access them in a transactional manner,

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,000
validate data and use dependency injection.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,286
Once all this is in place,

20
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:16,385
you will expose the business model through a documented REST API.

21
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:22,455
Along the way you will focus on testing all these components to make sure

22
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:25,600
they answer the business requirements and are reliable.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Finally,

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,444
you will create an Angular front-end to interact through

25
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:35,000
HTTP and JSON with the Java EE back-end.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,545
By the end of this course you will know the basis to get started building

27
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:44,000
REST APIs with Java EE and consuming them with Angular.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,692
The reward is that you'll know how to develop an entire web

29
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:50,500
application where you'll be able to visualize,

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,000
create, and delete books from an online bookstore.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,818
Before beginning the course,

32
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:59,571
you should be familiar with the Java programming language,

33
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:05,286
how the web and HTTP protocol work and a bit of HTML and CSS wouldn't hurt.

34
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:11,000
Java EE, Angular, REST, sounds like a lot to learn.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,231
But don't be scared,

36
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:16,000
this course will guide you step by step through all these topics.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Java EE with the Java EE Getting Started course at Pluralsight.
