00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,262
Our application is finally ready with the Angular

2
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:08,684
front-end talking to the Java EE back-end.

3
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:12,478
But you can feel there is more to it.

4
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:16,782
Welcome back to Java EE Getting Started course.

5
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:19,854
My name is Antonio Goncalves and in this last module we will

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:23,662
go through the entire application architecture so you'll get a

7
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:25,764
higher view of what we achieved.

8
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:35,026
I will also give you extra pointers if you want to dig into Java EE in Angular.

9
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,638
In the previous module we finished the Angular application by

10
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:43,893
adding a book service that talks to our back-end using HTTP and

11
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,815
the reactive programming model.

12
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,912
Thanks to the Swagger CodeGen tool,

13
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:53,543
it was just a matter of passing the JSON contract of our

14
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,422
book endpoint and generate the needed code.

15
00:00:56,422 --> 00:01:00,447
We finally achieved what we were looking for,

16
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:07,015
an Angular front-end application invoking our Java EE back-end.

17
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:10,057
I'll wrap up this course with this last module by

18
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:11,455
revisiting the entire application.

19
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:16,613
I'll focus on the changes we made on each and every module,

20
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:21,901
starting with Java EE back-end and finishing with Angular front-end.

21
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll end this course giving you a few external references so you can dive into both Java EE and Angular.
