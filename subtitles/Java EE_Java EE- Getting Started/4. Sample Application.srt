00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,712
Now that we have defined what Java EE and Angular are,

2
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:08,902
let's see the sample application that we will build from

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,660
scratch step by step throughout this course.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,569
Welcome to the BookStore application, as its name implies,

5
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:19,842
this application allows us to visualize a list of

6
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:25,569
existing books coming from a database, view the detail of each book,

7
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:29,902
delete it or create a new book.

8
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:32,569
Let's browse through it.

9
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,569
Here we are in front of the BookStore application.

10
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:41,569
Here at the top is our menu to access different functionalities.

11
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:47,569
Clicking on the book List menu will display the list of available books.

12
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:51,498
Clicking on Create will display a form where we can create

13
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:54,444
a new book and add it to the database.

14
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:59,069
Coming back to the list, if we click on the title of the book,

15
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:03,569
we see a different page with all the details of a book.

16
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:05,169
Once on this page,

17
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:10,646
I can go back to the list or delete this jQuery Beginner's Guide.

18
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:20,694
Now I have 99 books, I can click on another one, delete it, now I have 98.

19
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:27,569
Let's create a new book, let's say Java EE 8,

20
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,877
and description, unit cost, number of pages,

21
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:38,261
and if I create his book, now I have 99 books.

22
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:42,569
So as you can see, the BookStore application,

23
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,426
it's quite simple in terms of business rules,

24
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:51,569
but it has a very complex architecture with a Java EE

25
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,569
back-end and an Angular front-end.

26
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:01,069
With this sample application we will go through the basics of Java EE and

27
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,569
Angular and moreover how both communicate with each other.

28
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,736
All the books are manipulated by Java EE application and

29
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:12,205
stored into a relational database.

30
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:17,954
To interact with this database, we will expose a REST interface,

31
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:22,569
allowing us to have a JSON representation of these books.

32
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,031
To make sure our backend responds to the specification,

33
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:29,877
we will test it using the Arquillian test framework.

34
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:34,680
Then once the Java EE back-end is built and tested,

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,569
we will develop the front-end with Angular.

36
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,751
The Angular graphical components will consume the JSON,

37
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:54,000
coming from the back-end and will display HTML in the browser. That's the 10, 000 feet high overview of what we will build in this course.
