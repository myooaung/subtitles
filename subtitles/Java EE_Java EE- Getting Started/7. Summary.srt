1
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:05,638
Let's finish this module by having a higher level view

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:07,133
of our application architecture.

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:12,742
So the book repository is still the one dealing with the book entity,

4
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:15,750
accessing the database in a transactional way and

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,024
using external utility components.

6
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:23,861
What we did in this module is that we've exposed the

7
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,772
book repository through a REST API.

8
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:31,088
The book endpoint is a JAX-RS component that deals with HTTP

9
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:35,593
protocol and delegates the call to the book repository.

10
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:41,426
The REST API exposes a JSON representation of our books.

11
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:44,927
This API can be accessed through a browser or

12
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:48,840
automated through remote Arquillian tests.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,063
In this module we've seen the two sides of JAX-RS,

14
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:56,696
one is exposing a REST API using annotation,

15
00:00:56,696 --> 00:01:02,951
the other one is being able to consume it with a client API.

16
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:09,730
JAX-RS allowed us to easily add an HTTP endpoint on top of the book repository.

17
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:16,523
The book endpoint will actually be the entry point for our Angular application.

18
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:19,492
We've also added data to the database so the web

19
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:22,371
application has some data to display.

20
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:29,660
We also used the JAX-RS client API in an Arquillian test.

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,032
Now that we've exposed our book repository through a REST API we could end here

22
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:39,463
the Java EE part of this course and start the Angular part,

23
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:41,451
but we won't yet.

24
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:46,421
In the next module we will document the BookEndpoint API.

25
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:52,127
I'm not talking about documentation as a Java doc or any kind of text document,

26
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:57,296
I'm talking about documenting the REST contract.

27
00:01:57,296 --> 00:02:00,737
What HTTP methods are allowed on our REST endpoint,

28
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:06,696
which parameters to pass, which response is returned and so on.

29
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:17,000
Thanks to this contract we will then be able to generate Angular services to access our Java EE back-end.
