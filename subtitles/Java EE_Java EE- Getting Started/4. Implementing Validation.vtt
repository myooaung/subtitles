00:00:02.027 --> 00:00:04.797
Now that you know a bit more about bean validation and

2
00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:06.347
the built-in constraints annotation,

3
00:00:06.347 --> 00:00:11.577
let's go back to the IDE and constrain our code.

4
00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:14.391
To be sure that we insert and process valid data,

5
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.301
we will add some constraints to the book entity attributes,

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:22.046
but also to the book repository method parameters.

7
00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:30.340
We will, of course, change our test accordingly to test different scenarios.

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.658
Okay let's start with our test,

9
00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:42.283
so we go back to the BookRepositoryTest and we create a new test method.

10
00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:46.358
I'm going to call it createInvalidBook.

11
00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:52.016
So this method will create a book with a title null.

12
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:57.618
We don't want to have books with null titles in the database.

13
00:00:57.618 --> 00:01:05.310
So here copy/paste and instead of a title I put null.

14
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.207
So if I run this test, I'm inserting a book with a null title in the database,

15
00:01:12.207 --> 00:01:15.603
it passes and I don't want that.

16
00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:21.936
I don't want to be able to persist a book with a null title.

17
00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:30.382
So let's go to our Book entity and add bean validation's annotation.

18
00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:37.238
So typically the title, we want it NotNull,

19
00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:45.837
and with a size of minimum 1 and a maximum of 200.

20
00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:49.477
Let's do the same for the description.

21
00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:50.852
So we copy/paste it.

22
00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:58.359
It can be null, but if it's not we want its size to be between 1 and 10000.

23
00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:07.956
Unit_cost, also a minimum price of the book can be $1, what else can we do?

24
00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.864
Isbn, very important.

25
00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:14.062
An isbn cannot be null.

26
00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:22.458
And its size has to be between 1 and 50.

27
00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:27.121
Let's add one more constraint, past, yeah.

28
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.866
A publicationDate has to be made in the past.

29
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:35.704
So if we go back to our test and run it,

30
00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:39.576
now we have put NotNull on the book title,

31
00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.108
good.

32
00:02:40.108 --> 00:02:41.704
The test fails.

33
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:43.851
Could not commit transaction,

34
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:50.442
so the Entity Manager tried to do a persist and JTA rolled back.

35
00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:56.365
So we just change our test and say we expect an exception.

36
00:02:56.365 --> 00:03:04.753
Good, now the test is green because it has an exception.

37
00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:09.479
Let's do the same, but now for the BookRepository.

38
00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.711
The BookRepository has a few methods that take a parameter,

39
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:22.490
such as find takes an Id, we want this book Id to be NotNull.

40
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.779
Same for the create book,

41
00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:31.440
we want the parameter book to be NotNull and same for delete.

42
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.686
Let's go back to our test and add a new test.

43
00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:50.470
Again the test should fail and accept an exception and this test

44
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.943
will try to find a book passing a null Id,

45
00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.970
so I'm calling this method findWithInvalidId.

46
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.604
So we just take the bookRepository, call the method find,

47
00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:12.760
passing a null, this should fail because of the validation on the find method,

48
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.598
therefore it throws an exception, therefore the test should be green.

49
00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:20.366
Perfect.

50
00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:28.002
Now we have three tests and they are all green.

51
00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:31.037
Let's commit out code.

52
00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:36.867
So in this module we've changed the Book entity,

53
00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:54.000
the BookRepository with annotations, and we added two more tests. Let's change the commit message so it's clearer, validation, and Commit.
