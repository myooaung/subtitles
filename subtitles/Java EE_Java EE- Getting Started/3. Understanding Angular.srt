00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:05,490
Let's take a look at Angular now.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,073
Angular is a JavaScript framework created by Google

3
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:11,573
for building front web applications.

4
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:15,881
So naturally it also uses HTML and CSS.

5
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:20,906
But Angular makes our HTML more expressive by adding

6
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:25,573
features such as if conditions or for loops.

7
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:29,240
It has a powerful data binding so we can easily display

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,265
attributes from our data model into our web pages.

9
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:39,573
In our architecture, the Angular front-end needs to talk to the Java EE back-end.

10
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:44,573
This communication is simplified in Angular because it has a built-in

11
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:49,573
support to integrate with a back-end in a very easy way.

12
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:52,906
Last but not least, Angular comes with a fantastic ecosystem,

13
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:58,073
a great community of developers and tools for quickly bootstrapping an

14
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:02,573
application or generating components or services.

15
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:06,573
Even if in Angular you can develop directly in JavaScript.

16
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:10,573
It supports all the languages such as TypeScript.

17
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:14,129
TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language

18
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,573
developed and maintained by Microsoft.

19
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:22,240
It is a superset of JavaScript and adds static typing in class

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,073
based object-oriented programming to the language.

21
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:36,000
TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and is transpiled to JavaScript.
