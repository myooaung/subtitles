00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:06,873
Okay let's check that you've installed all the tools correctly.

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:12,036
First of all, we need Node JS to be installed.

3
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:15,814
Then we need Yarn to be accessible from the command line and

4
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:23,002
same thing for our two code generators, Angular CLI and Swagger CodeGen.

5
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:29,185
Let's switch to the terminal and execute a few commands.

6
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:34,725
So here I'm in front of IntelliJ IDEA and I'm using the terminal.

7
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:38,708
So first let's check that we have Node JS,

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:43,062
so a simple node js -v will give us the version.

9
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:48,190
This way we can also see it's correctly installed and in our path.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:55,794
Node JS comes with npm, so npm -v gives us the version of npm.

11
00:00:55,794 --> 00:01:00,677
Then we have to install Yarn separately,

12
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:07,621
again Yarn -v gives us the version of this packaging tool.

13
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:11,055
And we finish with the two code generation tools,

14
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:20,678
so Angular CLI as the prefix ng, ng -v gives us the version 1.

15
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:21,449
1.

16
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:25,453
0, and swagger-codegen version 2.

17
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,299
2.

18
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:32,000
2. Well it looks like we are all set up.
