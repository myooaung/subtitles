00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:07.794
In this module we've bootstrapped our Angular application and we are now ready

2
00:00:07.794 --> 00:00:12.446
to add some graphical components and talk to our backend.

3
00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:15.559
First of all, thanks to Angular CLI,

4
00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.690
we managed to quickly bootstrap an Angular

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.413
application that follows the standard Node.

6
00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:26.153
JS directory structure and defines the appropriate package.

7
00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:27.504
json file.

8
00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:32.609
This configuration file already comes with all the Angular dependencies.

9
00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.807
Thanks to Yarn we can easily install the application,

10
00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:45.165
a new dependency, or compile and run our application on the Express web server.

11
00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:46.327
All is set up,

12
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:49.973
it's now time to add some code to our bookstore frontend application.

13
00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:54.467
In the next module we will focus on defining the

14
00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:57.120
graphical components of our application.

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.365
Basically, we need a component to list all the books from the database,

16
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:08.787
show the detail of a single book, and a form to create a new book.

17
00:01:08.787 --> 00:01:10.705
So as you can already guess,

18
00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:20.000
in the next module we will mostly use the ng generate component command to save some time.
