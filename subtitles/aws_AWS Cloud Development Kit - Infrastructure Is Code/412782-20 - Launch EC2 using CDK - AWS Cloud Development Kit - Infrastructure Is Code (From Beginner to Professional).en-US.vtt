00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hello,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.820
folks.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.180
Welcome to another episode on City game.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.390
This time we're going to see how the launch and easy to instance inside and existing BBC.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.640
This is the sample reports entry that we have been using for importing the VPC.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.340
We're going to build on top offered.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.450
So instead of using the custom BBC section that we saw earlier here,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.300
what we're going to do is we're going to create one more file which is going to be

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.800
launching our easy to instance.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.540
So I'm going to call this as custom.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.980
Easy to Onda.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.860
We need the class structure on the imports from just going to copy this and move to two

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.690
over Easy to.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.800
So we're not going to launch anything yesterday,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.960
so I'm just removing it.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.630
Andi just need easy to on the court on.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.150
Let me just change the name off the stack as well.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.240
So we're all said the first step is importing and existing bpc.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.310
So this time I'm going to launch it inside my default vpc it can be any other BBC doesn't

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.100
matter at all,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.950
So let us go ahead and import it.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.730
So we have seen already how to imported so I'm just going to quit takeover head on to do

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.050
the front look up option.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.860
So let's go ahead and pick up that the 40 p c i.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.220
D.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.230
So the next step is launching the instance itself In city.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.430
If you have launched a few instances in easy toe,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.210
you know that launching an instance requires a multiple attributes.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.450
When you want to run an easy two instance,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.900
you will need to provide multiple parameters.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.460
For example,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.740
you want to know what is a since type of 32 micro R M for large or what type of mission

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.980
image,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.310
whether it's a Windows machine or Lennox machine on what BBC need to run on.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.450
What a deliberate is only want to run that incense all those parameters so all of them are

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.260
listed here.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.760
Some of them are optional,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.840
some off them are required.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.490
So let's go ahead and see how we can launch or 48 cents by providing are simple as a few

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.350
inputs that are required to religion Instance,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.640
so going back here,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.830
I'm going to go myself for themselves on it is under the easy to construct on.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.140
Then we have something going this instance,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.980
So they just have the scope on you.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.580
Got this?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
Expects over i d Then it comes the instance type.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:27.720
So just under instance type under that you need to provide an instance Type I d fire.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.070
So here is where you provide your stream as Tito Micro.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.720
If you have other instance types like em for lunch,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.050
this is where you will add them.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.910
Let us go ahead and now say my instance name or this is going to be the name deck.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.110
So I'm going to call this as 7001 This is just a name tag.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.750
It can be anything or you could just leave it empty or so.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.520
So now we need inform what type of mission in magic want to run it,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.560
whether it is an Amazon,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.910
Lennix or red at or when those you can choose that.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.570
So here also Amazonas built,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.300
then constructs for this.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.720
So we're going to call the Britain gun SEKs Waters machine image on.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.970
Then we are going to launch and land existence so that we can make it into a Web server

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.440
later.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.390
So I'm just going to say General Line X and inside this you need to provide which region.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.640
Because you know that Amy Thes are particular toe region.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.140
So we are going to launch it.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.840
And he was east one on room where I'm hard.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.350
40 years.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.160
It is not necessary.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.830
You need to hardcourts while you're here.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.290
You can go ahead and put them in.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.460
The one takes flight.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.410
We can see here on you can add the values here,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.870
then pick it up in your custom easy toe or any of the stack that you're bringing.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.060
So I want that before Amazon Lennox.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.400
So what I'm going to do is I already opened the lunch visit.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.680
When you open the lunch with that,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.510
it gives you the incenses as well less than I am.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.200
I i ds.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.590
So I'm just going to pick up the am I d for Amazon leanings to put that back here.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.070
So now we have got our mission image also.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.080
Then we need to inform which BBC we want to run if he already imported it.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.560
So I'm just going to say BBC equal to be PC on under,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.370
which submits.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.200
So since it is going to be on a web server,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.070
I'm going to run it in public subjects,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.860
so we need to select the public subjects on for selecting them.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.920
We haven't attributes for separate selection on the subject selection.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:41.580
I'm going to say subject typing to public then where we did the same thing when you're

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.590
choosing or launching ourselves custom,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.000
BP's even really spending it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.930
So let's check if everything is fine before going ahead and deployment.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.030
Let's have a quick check on our I want also to see what is there What is not there.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.950
So you can see it is building a custom BBC stack and it is not building my custom Easy to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.180
start.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.910
The reason for that is in the app God be Wi Fi.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.440
We have not important the easy to stack.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:16.750
So let us go ahead and import are easy to stack So here you go It is prompting it Western

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.670
Easy to stack.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.570
We have got that.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.970
I think it is in the lower case that we just go ahead and confirm that this is a lower case

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.410
custom,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.050
easy to stack.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.920
So I'm just going to days that no,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.020
we need to create and stack for that.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:50.130
So I'm just going to say custom anything to stack and we need to provide the environment Or

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.830
so So in this case and my environment equal brought have just made it into a very well.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.510
So my environment has the account number SLS division.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.310
So when you're running it in your country might want to change these values to suit your

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.970
equipments,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.350
that just doing city get ls now we should cease to stacks.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.820
So every time I want to deploy now,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.250
I have to specifically pick up this one are.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.410
And if you want to deploy board,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.490
you could just run city get deployed Command are if you don't want your PPC stack.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.800
Toby running other than do is you can just go ahead and come into it so that it is not

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.650
going toe brought do for that.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.010
So in our observer automatically out instance,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.200
role is going to be created.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.180
So it is asking for permission Whether you want to create an instance,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.190
roll on likewise and security group with our bones access is getting created.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.870
So do you want to provide access for that?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.930
I'm going to say yes.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.430
So when this is getting deployed,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.790
let s go to our local Mission stack section here as off?

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:43.080
No,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.970
we are having our new website.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.250
Was that getting created?

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.530
Likewise,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.650
if I go to my it is canceling except this one.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.140
So under instances,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.650
we shouldn't have any incidents running right now.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.480
That was the one that was served.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.470
They stayed some time back,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.810
conceal is terminated.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.260
It should get one more instance launched as part of this process.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.750
So that is wait for the permission to deploy.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:22.270
So now our stackers card point Let us goto our no console and see whether we have a new

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.320
instance running here.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.700
You can see here there's a new instance running on.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.480
It also has on I am Road.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.420
If you go to this,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.790
I am rolled Right now.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.820
There won't be any permissions attached to this.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.500
I am rolled.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
It is just before Jodi conceded and the permissions and I think it's there and it is just

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.570
having a translation shipping easy to.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.600
I was on aws that he said that instance can assume this role.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.750
But this instance itself does not have any permissions,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.540
and it also creates a default security group on the security group is going to other

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.430
traffic one from within the BBC.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.300
Only you're not going to have any other traffic kill you can see here.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.090
There's an inborn room on our borders.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.210
You can send traffic or the Internet.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.620
So remember this easy to instance is launched without on a keeper.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.250
You can see here that keep name is empty.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.520
So if you want,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.490
you can have another parameter attribute and add any keys that you might have configured in

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.700
your keepers so automatically this ever gets the lines with that keeper.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.910
So go ahead and connected and do some trouble shooting.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.220
So that is how you launch an easy two instance in an existing GPC.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.290
Go ahead and try it.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.600
If you have any problems for them in the government's,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.830
I'll try and help them with you.
