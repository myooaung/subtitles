00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
Hey there.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.530
Thanks for picking on my covers.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.970
If you are an AWS professional on,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.540
you're thinking is this right course for me?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.080
Are,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.380
um I in the right place?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.540
Then don't worry.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.880
Give me a few minutes so that I can explain to you what this course offers and why you need

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.050
to take this course.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.020
If you have been some time working with AWS than you might a provision,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.770
some resources in AWS,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.480
it might be with told formation or aws Samsel lie or with genetically on the ceiling or the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.130
court soul.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.640
But all of them have some problems with the data.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.280
It is not reproducible are you have a lot of errors because you are doing it manually or

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.080
sometimes it is very time consuming to deploy the same resources consistently in different

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.890
environments.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.650
On there is a lot of conflagrations in tax if you take,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.260
for example,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.430
a simple BPC,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.480
but it require about 300 lines of confirmation code.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.960
And if you're doing it through the control,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.960
it takes about a few minutes to reply.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.630
All this course is a lot of details.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.990
You need to remember everything so that you could consistently deploy that is when you,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.600
this course,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600
come to the picture.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.610
Is that a better way of doing things?

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.980
Do you always have to suffer all these things?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.370
That is where AWS city It comes into picture to take away all these problems that we're

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.860
facing.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.860
So let us go ahead and see what AWS Syndicate offers.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.070
When you're talking about Sirikit CD,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.410
get uses a familiar programming language.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.690
If you are a job a developer are fighting.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.600
Developer are no chairs or typescript or dark net.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.890
You can go ahead and write infrastructure code using your own family or programming

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.660
languages.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.480
It just doesn't stop there.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.030
You can use higher level concepts created by a lot of people in the open source community

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880
are provided by Amazon itself,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.290
so you don't have to go ahead on confident each and every detail.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.320
A lot of default values,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.520
which are from Arab use best practices,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.460
learn from multiple customers are provided on the construct itself so you can deploy and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.180
BBC in a bowl just three lines off code,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.660
and finally,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.550
you can treat your infrastructure a school.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.010
What this means is you can have programmatic loops.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.090
You can go ahead and checks for conditions,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.600
whether certain values are set as enterprise practices.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.130
You can also write s cases before even deploying them and do some driver.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.800
So Sirikit offers all these benefits.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.990
So in this course,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.460
what I'm going to show you is how to install and configure CD K on.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.730
Then we will also go ahead and see how to create your first stack on.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.910
Once you create your stack,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.590
let us go ahead and see how to use the best practices on all the tribal knowledge that is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.150
accumulated by all the people all across the open source community.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.160
And then we will try to see how important existing resources I'm customize your stacks so

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.940
that you can deploy them in different environments.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.000
And finally,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.840
we will create a multi tier resource stack.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.360
It just didn't stop there.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.010
They fell just a high level Concepts off what we're going to see in the scores.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.840
If I go a little bit deeper,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.450
some off them are listed here.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.450
You will see how to create a lambda functions how to create crown in the cloud,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.310
even driven architectures.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.950
A fully functional chat application also will be shown how to be pulled from the ground up

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.950
.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.170
So you no longer have to just listen to the videos and you need to scratch your head out to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.190
do them all the court and all the demo is available for you so you can go ahead and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.660
practice it in your own account if you're still waiting for it.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.350
Here is the latest offer for you.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.660
Get that benefit off the scores right now.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.060
See you on the other side.
