00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.280
Hello,

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.940
folks.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.250
Welcome to another lecture on city care.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.030
If you have been delivering static upside with your three service,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.450
you might have so in some limitations over it.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.110
For example,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.950
you cannot figure an SSL certificate for your static hosting sites.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.590
Or you cannot stop people from heart linking or,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.160
in other words,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.260
accessing your objects directly in your bucket through the links that our public to

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.070
everybody,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.190
you cannot have specific access restrictions or,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.930
if you want to add some content delivery on front off it and interesting people from

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.760
certain regions to access your pointed faster on you are heuristic other people from other

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.350
regions.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.910
Then you want to have on Gordon delivery network in front,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.830
off it on in AWS terms,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.340
we're specifically talking about adding cloudfront to your static website on.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.690
In addition to that,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.050
girlfriend offers a lot of benefits.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.830
For example,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.980
one of them is ordered in access identity.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.920
Let us see how ardent access identity helps for us to protecting your website,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.060
as well as delivering content with low latency to end users.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.350
So here we haven't static website,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.350
with some content that we want to take it or end users.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.330
Then What we do is we go ahead and configure and cloudfront distribution and friends off it

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.330
,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.540
which is pointing to our static website.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.900
So whenever your users are pointing to the clover and distribution,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.850
then they are able to get successfully the content.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.460
But whenever you have some users who are trying to access your static bucket directly using

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.140
the heart link,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.750
you are trying to guess the bucket name and trying to access the object.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.200
Then those kind of requests are denied.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.380
So you It also means that you don't have to provide public access,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.630
your pocket or Axum pocket policies that makes your bucket world readable so you don't have

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.860
to have a messy configuration.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.630
You have a nice and PC confrontation so that all requests are for our first through your

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.580
cloudfront one Lee.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.190
So let's go to our city haystack and see how we can build this.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.160
This is the stack that we're going to burn for our cold front static website.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.600
I have named it said,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.460
deployed girlfriend boy I static sites stack on.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.010
You can see here there some resources that are rebuilding.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.960
It is nothing but an s three bucket on.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.450
We're adding some contents into a straitjacket.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.360
The contents are coming from my study.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.250
A set directly that is there.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.950
These assets are going to be pre populated into my bucket by using and custom resource

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.480
which would be deployed for me by using this model goddess the S three deployment More do

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.280
so That is all that has been pre baked in.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.270
We need to go ahead and create a away I that its origin access identity so that our cold

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.080
front can securely talk to our street bucket on.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.040
But since we're going to use a new model that is covering model,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.930
we need to go ahead and install it and imported into our stack.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.550
So let us go ahead and do that.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:58.710
So now my girlfriend model has bean installed on updated.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.330
So let us close these two things that this imported here as well.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:13.530
So we have imported our clothes for and morning here.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.360
So let us build our boy ai first.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.890
So I'm going to call this as static side way I This is under our corporate mourn.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.200
You'll under Lord friend,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.000
we have something called us Origin access identity on.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.950
Let us go ahead and scope it.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.160
We have named our identity as well.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.560
So let us our comments.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.150
So we know about this and it is going to be used.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.930
I'm just going to use the stack name on so so that we can easily recognised from which

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.350
tactics has been deployed.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.730
So no way I has been created.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.070
Let us go ahead and start building or portrait conflagrations when you're talking over

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.780
total and we need multiple conflagration information,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.390
for example,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.870
What methods we want to support.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.120
What certificate for we want to use on whether we want to catch the request or whether you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.280
want to compress the request.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.950
Those kind of things.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.950
So that is what we're going to configure now.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.450
I'm going to call this as old friend Source one second under the court.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.610
From what would we have?

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.830
Something called a source configuration on.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.170
One of the most important information is where is the content is going to come from?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.220
So we're going to point it.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.450
Tow Rs three pocket now.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.380
So I'm going to say history Origin source on under told,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.830
friend,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.420
we have s three origin conflict on.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.350
We're going to say s three bucket source on driven where we have created a bucket here.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.570
I'm going to use the bucket name because all our content is in this bucket on.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.270
We also need the way I that we just know created.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.320
So let us go ahead and say the order access identity is static state way high.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.110
So that is on the source.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.930
Eight off information.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.590
What kind of behavior we want for our distribution.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.550
That is what we're going to configure next.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.730
And we can have multiple behaviors I had to our distribution,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.960
so I'm just going to add one off them now.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.350
So,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.230
in a girlfriend,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.890
dark behavior on the first thing is,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.950
is deport behavior because there's a ton off configurations in portraits.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.400
So I'm just going to set the default behavior for most of the things that we're not going

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.550
to configure on.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.320
I'm going to enable compression also what methods I want to support for my old friend

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.020
distribution.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.020
That is what we're going to configure next.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.780
Claude friend dart,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.280
close friend.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.330
All a load matters you see here that is something called as a load matters dot all on day.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.030
Another thing is whether I want to catch some off those cards,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.110
so I'm going to catch some off them once again.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.160
You have something God,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.370
as the cash methods on,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.830
I'm going to say cash all my get head option methods.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.550
Okay,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.740
so that is it for the your friend Configurations and behaviors.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.300
Finally,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.550
we're going to create our distribution itself.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.280
And once again,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.090
we're going to use the cloak print model for this one.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.870
On under this,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.860
we have something car as a cold,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.150
front swept distribution.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.740
Scope it on How?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.460
A name.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.280
Just add a comment also.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.910
So we know that what is this?

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.150
Distribution is about and finally would ordered in confrontation.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.520
Since we have done all the hard work of righting the complications here,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.550
just going to say this is going to be my lord in confusion.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.160
And remember,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.790
in cloudfront,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.800
you can have multiple sources.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.280
So this is an array,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.220
and we have just given only one off them.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.510
So I'm just adding that there Onda,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.540
we also have to choose a price class.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.130
If you remember,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.550
Conference can have big configure for all over the globe or whether in the Americas and

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.170
Europe on the other one s there,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.760
so you can choose whichever one you want on.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.910
I'm going to choose the default the price class here,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.950
which is going to be also the cheapest one.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.230
So that's it.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.830
So we have configured our cold front distribution.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.360
Also,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.150
since we're unveiling a website,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.750
I can go ahead and pick you up from the corporate distribution page.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.920
Or I can just open it it of my stack so that we can pick it up.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.350
So let us get that you are as well.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:55.790
So we have got all the resources and methods that I require.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.050
So let's go over and it's into Cesar Stack.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:08.000
Deploy it now.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.600
Our site has been completely deployed and this is that you are they just go to our stack

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.450
and check it out.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.830
So my stack has been completely deployed.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.920
Letters goto over s three bucket.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.840
First on,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.600
this is the bucket that has been deployed under this bucket.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.670
All the assets are there.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.700
But if I go to my permissions and show you my bucket policy,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.290
you can see here These are the bucket policy on it says that when the principal is going to

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.390
be this way,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.280
I identity.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.040
Then it is going toe to access to these objects.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.960
Otherwise that is no public access or anything like that on Likewise,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.360
if I just go ahead and show you my public access also you can see here there are no public

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.740
access,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.300
is also configured here or there just off.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.480
But I have not contribute anything by the four Siddiqui Stack has taken a sets and deployed

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.220
and put the old friend also in front off it without configuring any public permissions on.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.370
But we also don't have a static website running.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.860
So later Where we're going to do is we're going to go to our toe print on day,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.880
check out our distribution to see what all the complication that we have made here on.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.030
If I go to my origins,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:27.580
it is going to point to my way I basis site Oreste s three bucket that is be created on

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.480
Dunder behaviors.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.710
Also we can see here it is by default.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:37.530
It just really electing all my hesitantly traffic toe Hess et PSE world So that way all the

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.010
traffic is secured.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.810
We've seen the Broza on the cold front service.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.260
So they just pick up this domain name and put it into a roasted and see everything is

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.090
working fine.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.270
So you can see here my books.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.580
It is loading properly and remember,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.520
this access is because we have one.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:55.870
Forget it,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.250
boy.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.850
I object is directly coming from a cold front service and not from your freshly.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.030
If you go ahead and try to access any off this elements individually,

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.520
for example,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.320
that is an image that you want to try on.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.060
Access it.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.110
It will be from your core print only,

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.200
and your bucket is secure and it is not exposed to the public Internet on all the access

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.430
has to come from port front only that is how simple it is to create and website with go

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.690
