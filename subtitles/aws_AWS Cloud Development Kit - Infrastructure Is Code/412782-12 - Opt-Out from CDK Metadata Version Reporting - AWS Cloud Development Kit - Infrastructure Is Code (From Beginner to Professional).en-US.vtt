00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
and the folks gonna come back when you're using CD K,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.890
you're using underling and being models.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.190
If you're trying to create an s three year source,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.310
you're going to install the extreme dependency packages.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.050
All these packages have a lot of meta data on a lot of questions.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.900
Information.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.500
So Amazon collect all this information so that they can make some insightful analytics on

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.750
top off this data.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.860
I'm provide you with the better service.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.900
They're saying that they're collecting this information to understand what packages are

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.140
pretty useful people on the what questions off those packages are being used on.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.710
Then go ahead and include those packages.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.440
All this information that is it generation from your DEV environment is sent to AWS using

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.910
the total formation template I'll show you later.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.510
Alec is getting created and how it is getting set.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.280
The reason they're asking for this data is they identify which tax are using which packages

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.340
on and engage.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.350
Those packages are having some security issues or some reliability issues.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.470
They can go ahead on contact users for those issues and inform them saying there is a

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.020
security should they be to obtained it or want another package or another service that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.570
might not have the dependencies or security issues.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.850
So the question comes scanning up.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.900
Don't know for sending this telemetry data to AWS.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.410
Yes,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.240
it is possible.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.200
You can go ahead,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.310
customize your city kid or chase and file on Said you were reporting to falls.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.050
Then you stop sending this meta data at all the interviewers cloud.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.360
So let us go back to our environment that see how we can do this.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.960
In the bravest lecture,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.360
we completely destroyed our stack so we don't have anything.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.910
So it could be a better our time to start deploying your stack and see where is the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.000
telemetry data getting created If I don't see the get unless it is going to synthesize my

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.150
template that we already know that.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.730
And then if I do insidious and on you can see it.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.790
This is the telemetry data I'm talking about.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.360
You have a city came a calendar that is added on.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.920
Likewise,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.190
if you have the monuments that have been other Andi for each resources is going to add it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.750
that way.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.480
So if I goto micro formation template here and scroll up,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.170
you can see here there's a metre data on the city get partners there.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.850
So when we're going ahead and deploying it,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.070
this in their information on a few other pieces off information like what Note models that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.080
you're using on what questions are those?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.950
No more deals are also saying to It appears I'm going to go to my court formation resource

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.950
.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.370
So they received.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.950
The stock is getting created.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.240
They are going to look at the resources so stated we can go to the template section on Did

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.510
here you can see here.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.130
Other models it lists sold all the different packages that are required on for running this

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.750
resource.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.500
So this information is being sent in.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.370
Guess you think that you don't want this information to be said.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.440
All you have to do is in your foot off your directory.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.880
You'll have a file called the Syndicate or Jason.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:13.650
Just go head on and act is variable destiny in bushing importing Poland forts.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.770
And then we're If it is done correctly,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.970
you'll have the border formatting.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.490
So we have done that.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.820
So what I'm going to lose?

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.650
I'm just going to do in Sydney Kaye Ellis,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.670
because we're not changed anything on.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:34.500
I'm just going to Radio City Cason and let us do a diff now to see what has changed if that

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.410
is going to be in change or not to consider.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.960
Obviously,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.120
the Philly committed that I speak the mood from my confirmation templates.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.550
So I'm just going to who City deploy again.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:54.040
So now this information is no longer being sent.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.760
Any changes over that I make is no longer going to be reported on the AWS Cloud.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.110
So let's just go back to our core commission template here on Let us leave this alone and

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.440
just going to get the screen on.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.680
Let's see Yeah,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.090
you can see here once I refresh my screen,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.120
the entire material has gone here.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.110
All the question reporting and everything is gone when Lee,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.250
you are saying that this morning this being generated here.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.560
So that is how you can go ahead and stopped elementary that being sent to AWS.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.930
If you are putting your organization which is ah concerned about security,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.370
that sort about privacy,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.530
then you can differently.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.360
Go ahead and look at this option and secure your packages and templates cried out.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.350
If you have any problem for them in the government's help to meet you.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.050
Thanks for watching Happy loving
