00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.260
Hello,

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.980
Falls.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.960
Welcome back.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.000
You might want to clean up your resources when you're done with your experimentation or you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.090
might be doing a people.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.670
See,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.010
while the idea what did not vote out,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.780
I want to clean up.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.440
The resources are you do point something incorrectly or you want to make some modifications

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.070
and want to start from scratch.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.040
Then you want to destroy those resources.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.780
This is where the syndicate to strike.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.580
A man comes into place on doing what this command is going to call.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.620
The information released on that command has some dependencies.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.230
For example,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.450
if you're going to clean up on s three bucket,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.150
it is going to fail in a very nice,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.790
clean way.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.470
Saying that the ESPYs resource might have some differences,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.940
like someone telling objects.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.740
So it just not going to delete that?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.430
Likewise,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910
if you're going to try intelligence if Unity pro,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.350
which is at that toe easy toe instance than the delete off the security group is going to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.800
fail.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.680
So there is a list of reasons why an elite off your stat might fail because they are

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.530
related to the confirmation delete limitations.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.180
So if in any case,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.210
if you have a problem?

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.040
I would highly recommend you to go ahead and current the powerful underlying confirmation

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.630
itself on final,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210
while the deal it is failing.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.900
Then you come back and troubleshoot.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.350
Seek and destroy command.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.270
If I take you to my stack here we have deployed a couple of history buckets.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.370
And if I go ahead and try and delete them,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.380
it will just delete the total mission stack,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.320
not the bucket,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.210
except can show you the case.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.540
Here we are in our your inflammation.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.050
So if I take you to my street bucket,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.850
you can see here that are three buckets.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.080
This is the tool kit.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.210
That is a staging begin.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.770
That does not be part of the stack that we created in this project on there at the two

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.750
package be created on right now.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.250
There are no objects here.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.770
So this is the other one that no objects.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.130
So what?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.610
I'm going to go.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.370
Some just went toe.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.870
Quickly.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.100
Add one object.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.140
One of this buckets.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.890
In my experience,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.090
that has many changes.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.090
It just leaves the S three bucket for you to clean up in most cases.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.030
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly create another source like,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.530
for example,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.400
and I am group and then go ahead and triggered the strike a man and see whether that I am

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.550
group gets deleted.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.650
So if you remember,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.390
if you want to install any additional people in sees the commander's pip install aws high

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.610
fun CTK,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.120
dark AWS iPhone I am So it's going to install it that this important package here So

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.450
anybody importantly to me quickly go ahead on creating I am group.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.160
So I'm just going to quit.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.720
You call this a century?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.340
I d andi.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.220
It isn't to say so.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.710
A template so ardently changed it Good.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.960
So when this is getting created that me take you to my I am group spanning here for right

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.850
now that is quite one cook ADM group on.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.530
Once my stack is completed,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.020
we should be able tow find another group here.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.510
So there is an updated progress that we just kowtow resources You can see here that's Nghe

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.830
Group is getting creative.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.550
And if I could my Evans,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.490
that is also what's happening.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.340
So let us go here and refresh.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.180
So my group was created so back to our template.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.860
Meanwhile,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.990
what?

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.240
And when you lose also on one fight the S three bucket.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.950
So we will have to face cases and see what happens when you get that destroying command.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.290
So my stack is completed.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.310
Even you see here the open are showing the bucket enemy.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.050
That is not what we wanted live in.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.530
Just so we have a lead.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:53.650
Me Finally we just uploaded me Fine on going to upload it to this bucket.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.950
So the problem is completed.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.900
I think we'll do this bucket now.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.620
And freshmen screening should have about finding here good images.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.200
Go ahead,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.970
Andi,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:15.150
trigger that seek and destroy command on it is not going to immediately go ahead and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.640
diligence.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.860
Tack.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.010
It is going to ask you for your information when leaving you press.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.450
Why are s then we need to adjust our activity.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.690
You stack So it is triggered This here on difficult back to the information here and see

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.210
for villains that happening here.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.450
You can see that it's in the daily complete.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.150
So this stack is deleted by now on defiant.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.480
Did you do my s three bucket on?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.860
You can see here it is not.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.740
Did he turned up like a stupid case.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.490
These other two buckets on none of them are deleted.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.740
But if I told them,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.540
I I am not refreshed my page here in a fresh it this world should have gone.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.120
If we go back to confirmation on go to resources,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.430
it would clearly say that it is escape those deleting news Pakistan Charitable.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.380
So there are some spaces mechanisms built into the core formation,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.380
delete and civic.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.860
It also follows the same sensible defaults.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.240
So if there is the resources that is having dependencies are there is some possibility off

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.900
data delusion for the client side,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.540
the entity is going to fail.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.440
I know.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.920
Very nice game on.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.750
You will have to clean up those resources.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.990
Just keep that in mind when you're doing that crying.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.470
If your problems for them in the comments or questions I'm trying help them do.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.680
Thanks for watching.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.650
Happy learning
