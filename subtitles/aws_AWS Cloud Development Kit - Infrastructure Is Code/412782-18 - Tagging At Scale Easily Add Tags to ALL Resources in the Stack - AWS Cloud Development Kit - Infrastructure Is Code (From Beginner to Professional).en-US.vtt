00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Hello,

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.990
folks.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.660
Welcome back to another episode on Siri K.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.300
This time we're going to learn how to tag all your resources in your stack.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.560
Earlier we saw if you have multiple resources like a BBC or forget cluster or s three

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.030
bucket,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.350
you need to add tags individually.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.040
But that is not going to scale,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.950
and it is going to be quite error prone.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.650
If you have multiple resources,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.040
how do you tag all the resources in a particular stack?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.600
For example,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.810
you want to have a support team for database Thakor and support team for Network Stack.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.050
Then you want the guy said in an address toe all the resources in the network stack.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.000
How do you go ahead and do that in one place?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.600
So all the resources will pick up the military's on have a attack?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.390
That's what we're going to see now.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.810
We have been using this as a positive as our most act earlier.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.410
If you notice that we created a BBC,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.470
we also created an s three bucket with a single tag.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.420
If you just go here under the BBC section,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.530
you can see here there is a name tag on as well as an owner tag.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.270
Likewise,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.730
on the extreme console,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.190
we will have a few tax like four bags out there the deport,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.980
local mission decks and a couple of them that was added by us.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.870
So this is not going to scale.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.420
So I'm going to show you how you can add it at that stack level.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.060
The best place to do it is if you go to the abductee wife.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:27.620
I All you have to do is just called art Dag dog ad on the same format that we saw earlier.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.920
We're just going toe at the school bus app on.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.960
Then the key name is going to let us say we're going to call this as a stack owner are on.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.750
The value is going to be Let us pick the value from the context because we already learned

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.110
how to pick it up from the context.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.450
So I'm just going to say afterwards nor dot fry and get going fixed on this time.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.850
We're going to say,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.930
Pick it up from the N.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.350
Y in men's because we have multiple environments.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.770
If you go here under city gauges and you can see here under context,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.850
we have multiple environments for day one product.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.580
So I want to say support email for Let me pick up the key from here.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.920
This is the key via looking for John Scenic ages.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.250
And we're going to have a support team on Say it can be ABC at X y said dot com Go back

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.680
under enemies under broad You're going to have a key here,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920
So that is one tax like white second at another Dag.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.860
So this time they just just say stack leverage bags,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.480
just another frenzy Tag value can be,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.730
as generally gathers anything it is.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.240
Example.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:59.300
Dag you If everything is good,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.820
we sure hasn't to say so.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.480
Stack on.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.190
Then we should be able to deploy it.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:14.050
So my diploma tres began that this goto our information on see what is happening there.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.920
So I'm just going to leave the stab faceted so we can see the difference.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.500
So here we have about five tax on that.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.450
We should have two more added to our BBC.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.150
So you can see here the militants have been picked up from a context while and also the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.320
stack tagging that we added.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.910
Likewise,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.410
if I go to my estate market as well.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.630
I should have two more bags here so earlier goes for.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.350
Now you can see it.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.790
Six.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.930
Tax on.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.090
We can have the stack level tagging added on also the stack Team support team editors.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.310
So that is how you go ahead on the added tax for your and their stack in one single place,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.080
you can have a for loop if you don't bite on you just have a Jason file with all the tax

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.150
that you want to add and just right and four look for so that all the tax get added in the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.470
problem.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.860
I think with that is also possible.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.940
Go ahead and try that.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.900
If you have any problems,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.390
put them in the western section.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.780
I try and help them with you.
