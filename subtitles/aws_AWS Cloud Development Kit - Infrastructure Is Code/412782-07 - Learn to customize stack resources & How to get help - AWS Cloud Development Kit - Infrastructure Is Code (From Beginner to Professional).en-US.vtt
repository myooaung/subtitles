00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hello,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.950
folks.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.150
When come back in considering the city Gates series earlier we saw how to create our

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.410
personal license back on deploying it,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.810
using the city get toolkit on within our stack We deployed in s three bucket And if you

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.740
remember that stack was creating the S three bucket on gave a name off its one.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.240
For example.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.900
In this case,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.470
it is my first city gate bucket,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.790
followed by the logical idee handsome I identified at the end.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.170
What if you want to test a MySpace?

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.070
How do you go gold customizing your resources so that you know that what you are creating

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860
and then you can refer it in other thing plants.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.390
For example,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.850
if you're creating and vpc you want to prohibition it with a certain I Beatrice off your

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.150
own,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.670
you want to make sure that I p address ranges not overlapping with your other existing idea

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.600
tresses on also with your corporate networks.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.590
So how we go about customizing post resources?

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.330
So here we are in our environment on this is the court that we used to deploy our s three

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.250
bucket on.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.810
You can see here we have just mentioned self that is cope off this object on also the

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.400
logical I.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.780
D.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.650
So what this time I'm going to do is I'm going to add a packet.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.130
Name on.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.170
You can see here.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.830
It lists me all the property.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.920
This is one of the benefits of having an i d.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.900
Even creating a resource so that you can go ahead and identify water sources have acquired

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.820
what information that you need to provide engages you.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.650
This information is not enough on the one toe,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.930
no more about them.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.400
What you can do is they're gonna go ahead on and check out their abuses.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.160
He degale if they were friends,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.750
I'll put this.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.570
You are in the description also on our resources.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.030
We can go and take it out on since I'm going to use fight on.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
So I'm going to go to the fighting here and then I'm going to search for s three.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.620
Let us go here on.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.090
I am trying to create a bucket.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.650
So I want to know all the properties that I can supply doing Bucket.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.360
So what properties have been if I go ahead and click on bucket and in the bucket last,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.480
I have all these properties and one of the properties will be pocket name here.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.920
So I'm just going to sense for it on when I said for bucket name,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.340
it stays that this is a physical name off the pocket on by default,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.440
it is assigned by court formation on it is also recommending that that should be default.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.280
The reason for that When your provisioning in a pocket with custom ice bucket name it needs

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.860
to be unique so that it doesn't collide with any off the other bucket keys out there in the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.000
STD name space.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.880
That is why Siddiqui recommenced you to leave the bucket name to itself so that it can

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.640
provision unique name on always.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.040
You referred to the logical idea that we have.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.840
Even then if you want oh,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.430
say that I want to provision the bucket then myself.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.050
Then you can go ahead and do that.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.470
So I'm going toe adds a bucket name and then I'm going to prime create a unique pocket name

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.470
.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.050
So what I'm going to do is just saying my CD gay.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.420
They use the other stack name itself.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.350
Hopefully that is unique enough on just for some good measure I'm just going to throw some

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.670
random numbers at the end.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.850
Andi let us.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.050
But our city gets that.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.730
So now everything should be simple enough.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.460
So let me just go ahead and build it.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.080
So whenever you making changes,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.750
save the change so that you can see here.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.720
That's a tiny dark that you enabled auto save.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.790
It might not be there,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.720
but let us just say with and then I'm just going to running.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.820
And this just to make sure that it's no others here and that I'm just going to say city

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.330
case.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.610
And so when they do the scent,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.270
you can go ahead and check it out in your Medicare out repository.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.560
Or so this is our template on here.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.730
You can see here the bucket name properties added on the little school head on.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.620
Deploy it.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.210
So we saw this earlier.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.040
This is going to packaged our template on created change,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.020
said on denim.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.900
Trigger the changes on the cloud.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.160
So once it rolls down to the next step while just take you to the confirmation,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.170
our service and then we'll see that even said,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.400
see what has happened in there.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.880
So it started making the changes you can see here it is requesting an update for the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360
creation of the new physical resource.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.090
Because but get names are universal.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.670
You cannot just born rename them.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.050
So City is going to create a new market for us now,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.030
So they just go back to our service here on this is our stack and you consider already

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.740
update in progress on if I see here,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.290
that is new events in place.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.050
So let's go ahead and refresh your screen.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.880
Onda Uh,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.710
remember,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.680
really get there is not a religion pockets immediately,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.930
especially if it is an extra bucket.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.800
If there is another source which it thinks that it can daily safely,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.340
it will go ahead and delete them.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.030
Otherwise,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.690
it's just going to keep those resources.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.150
And when you're asking it to delete those resource,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.460
it'll ask you for a confirmation on.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.630
Sometimes you you will have another check box if you're going to the G A y,

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.850
so that you can confirm that I want to delete this bucket.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.190
So update is complete lettuce goto our history console.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.670
Here,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.900
let me just close this.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.650
I'm just going to refresh my screen again,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.890
so hopefully that must be two buckets you can see here.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.730
That is two packets.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.370
This is the 1st 1 that was created earlier on.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.020
This is the other bucket we just now got created.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.620
So this is one way off customizing your bucket parameters.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.750
Let me just go ahead and open this presidential.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.800
Couple more things.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.530
For example,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.030
In this case,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.050
if I goto properties,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.750
you can see here The washing is not enabled.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.650
Onda,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.160
let me just go ahead and enable worsening likewise that it's known encryption also for this

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.640
pocket.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.080
So let us go to our concern here on day.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.440
I'm just going to add questioning your bucket so you can see all the parameters of

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.880
austerity.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.890
If I scroll down somewhere,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.650
I should be able to see washing.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.880
If not,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.490
let us just go ahead and start typing here.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.150
Actually,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.250
there's a bullion value,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.050
so I'm just going to say true here,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.750
it should be camps true on DSO.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.990
You know what?

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.670
Watching in a wood Andi for encryption.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.960
You can see here that is encryption field here typing encryption on for encryption.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.250
It is an invaluable enormous enumerated.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.430
Well,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.940
because there can be different options.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.600
For example,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.300
when Jews?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.860
Yes,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.030
the managed encryption or the customer encryption or silver side encryption.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.180
So since there are multiple options,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.100
we need to back this way so you can see here all the three options are listed.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.350
So I'm going to choose game us managed.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:35.530
So I'm just going to think they would on then once against Gay Ellis to make sure there's

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.710
no errors.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.760
Then let us do in sent here and once isn't to say 6 10 If you just go back here,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.480
you will see there is a silver said encryption enabled on also that must be in Washington.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.730
Here,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.590
you can see in question configuration status,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.110
neighborhood.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.150
So let's go ahead and deploy this now.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:02.540
So the change that has been updated let us go back to your console shares.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.310
You can see here.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.530
Still,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.420
it is not enable.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.850
So I'm just going to go back to Metro information.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.890
Onda.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.350
That must be some evens coming up here.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.750
You can see there's an update in progress,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:20.490
so I'm dead has been completed for the bucket.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:28.340
So just going to go ahead on the first screen here you can see here the wishing has been

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.670
enabled Onda default encryption heroes of the famous encryption has been taken to place so

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.590
you can go ahead and customize encryption.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.880
Also,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.290
to choose material form of encryption you want are ready custom encryption that you want to

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.950
Jews as well.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.950
That is also possible.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:49.390
So by default you can choose a blues extreme anything on the parameters that you can send

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.550
in so that the direct qualifications will be taken on and it predicted to effect.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.670
This is one way of using the services that is so another way.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.540
Because in this,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.250
uh,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.720
page Amazon has not listed any examples.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.650
That is another place where you can go ahead and find some examples.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.590
So if you go ahead and type by then,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.700
the CTK s three,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.080
they will bite and big package that we installed earlier on You can see here some of the

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.160
examples that we're using,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.650
for example,

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.080
of my first bucket on.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.810
Then how to enable encryption here on day.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.150
Also,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.480
if you want to do our some other parameters,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.710
that is also possible.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.250
So this is how you check you for your resources.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.690
Take some examples on,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.130
then start customizing your gored.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.540
Since the league is being constantly developed that are always the new examples coming up

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.250
on the Internet.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.800
And sometimes you might be the person first time using that resource are customizing that

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.140
resource in a particular way.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.330
Then you might have to go ahead and publish those examples in get up.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.540
So in the next video,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.980
what I'm going to show you is how you can control your stack so that you know what
