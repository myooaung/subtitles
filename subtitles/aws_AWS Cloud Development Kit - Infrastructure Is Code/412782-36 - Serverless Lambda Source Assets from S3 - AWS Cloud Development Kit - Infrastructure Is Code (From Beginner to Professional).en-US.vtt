00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.260
Look,

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.830
folks,

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.650
welcome to another lecture on city again.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.110
This time we're going to talk about building Lambda functions with source code that is

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.420
coming from yesterday or any other external source where you can have active fix.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.110
The reason for that is quite often you're dependent on libraries that are coming from third

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.780
parties.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.550
Are your Jenkins build or open with during the act effects in a positive like history?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm from there.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.750
You need to pick up those artifacts and build it into your humble functions as dependencies

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.750
,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.490
our main functionalities.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.790
So in those cases,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.840
you need to pick up the source port from somewhere else.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.800
We just not in your city gets there on.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.700
Then deploy.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.040
You are Lambda Functions.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.050
So that is what we're going to simulate today.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.920
So the first thing is,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.440
we're going to have a S three pocket there,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.000
went to upload some cold on,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.550
used that court to deploy an Atlanta function.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.850
I'm tested out in the console and see whether everything's looking fine.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.090
So let us go toe silicates that and see how we can do this.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.810
So this is the stack that we're going to build on,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.310
and I have named this as a custom lambda source from Ashley Stack.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.600
We're going to use the same time the process and that is constant processor,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.970
which is nothing but taking the event on blogging it into the control and sending it back

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.940
us and adjusting body so that you can do with processing and maybe get a part.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.550
So on first thing for deployment toe s report,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.080
as we need this fire packets into its supply so that when the court gets departing the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.330
concept that then departed the Tampa function.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.700
So I'm going to zippers in my next laptop.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.590
If you have windows,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.040
you can go ahead and use the windows.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.620
Basic utilities on sit them in the big,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.850
So let's go ahead and do it in line X.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.310
But I mean,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.860
now we get to my Berit Reiss over less andan under that have number source on this intact

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.740
or something like that,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.150
followed by the supply name on the contents that is going to go inside this.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.420
So we'll have a news you find here.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.210
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to upload this into my extra pocket on then after once

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.680
it is uploaded We're going to import it into our stack and start building a lambda function

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.270
on the love Ruben so that you can go ahead attested.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.350
Let us go Door s three console and see what is there I have created and pocket called this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.150
constant as expected on right now,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.810
this bucket does not have any objects.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.490
So they just go ahead and create a folder so little which can hold all our Lamba social.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.770
So I'm going to call this number SRC that is under sores on inside this directory.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.610
What we're going to do is we're going to upload our point that we just know created Onda.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.110
I'm not changing any permissions here.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.440
Just default permissions.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.850
So we caught our court updated.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.590
So let us import this bucket into our stack.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.350
Now I'm going to call this bucket as a constant bucket.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.460
Onda,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.590
we have used the familiar concept off s really am the logs on the course so that the school

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.970
head and started importing or bucket And here we have multiple attributes.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.390
I'm going to use the from back It attributes you can go ahead and use of pocket name also

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.160
fritters sculpted on.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.250
Then we've got this as the Johnstone,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.380
I said,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.350
It's like it next is the bucket me.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.750
Do you have us on?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.100
Then?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.340
If you want the bucket name,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.950
we can just go ahead and pick it up from here as well on then put it into the spring here.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.110
So we important the bucket.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.250
Now we can access the objection status pocket,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.250
but using this way.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.850
So let's go ahead and start building or them their function.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.710
Onda,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.660
since we have seen notable and a function,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.830
let me just quickly run through the default settings.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.380
And then when the important cities comes,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.550
let me force and talk about it.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:48.550
So handle it is one more thing that you need to be very about.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.240
Usually we kill the index tracked people,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.490
but this is going to be under that supply on.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.110
So that means that we need to know when it is and simply to be constant processor under

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.310
that,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.610
the main maternity to call that is Lambda at the school counter.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.180
So I'm just going to pick up this value Onda handler,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.330
Put that and then you have something called best Down.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.530
The underscores handler may not introduce and enter there Okay,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.630
so next is quote where the sport is going to come from.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.850
So here we have under Lambda.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.960
We have something called us SP coat on inside this it is going to ask us what is the bucket

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.960
,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.440
but the court is going to come from.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.480
I'm going to say to call this inside his pocket on you also need to give the key on.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.870
Remember,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.930
the key is if we go back here,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.360
it is under this directory called.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.630
That's a better score source on.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.390
Followed by this.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.030
It's like the zip file.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.940
Find them can pick it up from here.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.530
So we got our from the court on that.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.070
If you want,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.010
you can go ahead and at the time of the on the cell,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.620
concurrency or so we're good to go on.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.040
Then let me also add a custom law group and show you how you can set up the retention by

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.470
default.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.940
Their attention is a very long time.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.900
If you want to set it up our attention for,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.080
say,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.760
for example,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.160
a week or two weeks,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.300
we can easily to that part.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:19.930
So I'm going to show you how this the room where we're setting it up for Lambda Lambda

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.450
syntax of something like showing here aws slash lambda slash function name.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:34.940
So I'm going to put the same thing here just very for the function name Dart function.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.420
Name was the braces on Dhere is important part removal policies.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.880
We know if we do this when the attack is deleted,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.120
it will automatically delete my the laws.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.120
Also on retention we have something under slows dark retention on.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.640
If I do it,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.000
Doctor,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.170
you give on the possible combination off retention period.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.510
So let's go ahead and say I want to detain this log for one week is going to choose this

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.200
that saved this fight on.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.920
They just go ahead.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.210
And since I say so,

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.650
Stack,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.010
you see here I'm not the correct directory.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.180
So that is what is complaining.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:24.090
So they just go out to a wasn't directory so that we can set the size our stack go ahead on

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.780
deployed.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.030
So the two things that we're going to check Issa oneness of whether my Lambda is picking up

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.320
support from history and deployment correctly,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.010
and then the next thing is whether my law groupers a retention period of one week So they

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.990
just go to our AWS console here on that.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.470
Let me just refresh my screen as off.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.600
No,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.820
no.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.020
Lambda functions that there.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.230
As soon as my stack gets completed,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.040
we should be able to see and Lambda Fortune getting deployed with the source court from

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.550
actually on that we should also have on the retention period set.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.860
So we have a function.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.300
Directors get inside or function and see the source code.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.450
You can see the same thing that was in our console and constant processor B y.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.060
It is.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.000
Go ahead and created biscuits and just don't.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.350
But if everything is working fine.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.410
So we should see an under control,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.550
Something like body.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.420
Yeah,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.450
You have the message here.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.590
123 And if I go to my logs,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.210
it is navigate.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.360
From here on,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.870
we should see the same information in Orlando logs as well.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.940
So if I call back here,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.430
I should have the retention Peter,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.690
for so set here.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.740
So this is how you deploy lambda functions with the source for from different locations,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.040
whether it is an artifact bucket that you have in one account or from another account for

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.150
another region you just go ahead and pick it up.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.730
I didn't use that before Your Lambda functions,

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.300
go ahead and try them.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.840
It's a very powerful feature.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.960
If you have any problems,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.380
put them in the comments section.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.250
We can learn from each other Central watching happy.
