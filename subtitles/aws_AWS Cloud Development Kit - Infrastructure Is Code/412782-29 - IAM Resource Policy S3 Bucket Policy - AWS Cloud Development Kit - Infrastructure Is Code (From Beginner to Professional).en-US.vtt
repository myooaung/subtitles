00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hello,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.980
folks.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.290
Welcome to another episode on City Que.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.040
This time we're going to talk about creating resource policies in interviews that a number

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.900
of resources,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.580
for example,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.920
estranged one off them,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.640
which allows resource policy on likewise you can go ahead and created resource policy for

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.920
and care musky are an SNS topic or even in Lambda function that also allows and function

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.450
policy.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.660
So this example,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.020
let us go ahead and see how we can create a resource policy for s three pockets.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.070
You should be able to take the same knowledge on try to create a first policy for any other

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680
service that is supporting it.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.350
So that just goto a stack and see how we can do this.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.800
So this is a stack that we're going to use toe build our source policy on Since we're going

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340
to talk about S three on the policies,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.830
so have imported history,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.200
and I am concepts.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.470
So I'm going to start by creating an s three pocket on.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.380
I'm going to call my bucket as a constant bucket.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.040
You can go ahead and go that whatever you want,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.150
let s go ahead and quickly build the constructs here.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.580
So I'm going toe How some assets here that to say,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.760
I want this bucket to be apportioned Andi,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720
while I'm removing this stack.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.710
I want this bucket also to be removed.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.700
And what I do is I just go ahead and say it or not removed for the sea dart.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.450
Try and remember this will Still not working for you.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.770
How some content in the pocket,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.400
your leader manually go ahead and deleted.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.600
But if you don't have any content in the pocket or any flying objects,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.650
then the stack will automatically deleted.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.830
But there is,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.360
ah,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.970
bucket policy here on.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.470
Remember,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.820
I'm not adding any a public relaxes here.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.250
That is what we're going to do.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.950
We're going to use the resource policy itself to add some permissions and privileges.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.690
So how am I going to do that?

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.060
So we can use the concern bucket on then?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.670
Under this,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.490
that is an maternal coldest add resource policy you can see here at the bottom are to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.520
resource policy.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.560
On inside this,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.490
we have the familiar I am policy statement construct so we can just go ahead and write our

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.120
policy statement here on inside the policy statement it uses a family or a part mortal.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:28.730
So effect is going to me alot because I'm going to give some public access here on for

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.280
actions is going to be all aesthetic objects.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.650
So Estrich Colon,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.020
get object on nexus resources.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.260
Walk for water sources.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.940
I want to kill this poor emissions.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.130
So for this is going to be for my dentist.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.570
Say this bucket is going to hold objects which is having a steamer text files and some

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.390
image ones.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.170
But I want to give public access only for his team.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.830
All flights.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.750
Then you can simply go ahead and say constant bucket,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.690
no ad and for objects on.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.330
Then we can customize build objects like this.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.770
So start our taste him and what this is going to do?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.210
This?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.650
It is goingto do public access or whatever access we're defining here toe the objects which

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.420
are ending with dark history animal so it can be having any violent.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.920
But if it is ending its estimate,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.670
it will have this policy.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.550
Guys do it.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.650
So finally,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.330
what principles are going toe have access to this policy.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.450
So I'm going to say any principle.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.980
So that means that anybody in the Woods is what the policy may exit public access because

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.850
anybody can have access to the objects which are having tasty and at the end.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.100
So I want to add one more to transport.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.210
See,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.160
How will I do that?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.150
So simply what we can do is you can just go ahead and create another policy statement.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.880
So what I'm going to use,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.530
I'm just going to start with this one on this.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.840
This time it has just close this first so that we don't have a better later.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.610
So I am policy statement on this time.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.210
What I want to do is I want to deny all CTP access.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.690
So how do I do that with our condition key for that specifically for this so that the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.550
school had and at that effect,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.600
So we're going to deny all non secure transport.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.420
That's what this means on actions is going to be for all SP bucket objects.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.860
So I'm just going to put the star here.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.470
So this is one of those places were having and start privileges in your record policy is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.170
acceptable because we had denying the privileges there.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.450
So resources is going to be for my bucket air and itself.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:47.200
So let me be careful here because my auto complete is within the brackets.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.260
It's not going to work.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.730
So just going to say bucket there and here on B will carefully closing my bucket air

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.820
followed by my slash star.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.370
So what?

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.210
This means that it takes a bucket air and followed by the start means any objects under

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.270
that bucket will be denied access if the metal of access is not hasty DPS so for any

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.750
principle,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:18.430
once again And here is where the important magic happens Conditions on the conditions were

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.590
going to have a boolean value under bullion.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.840
What?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:33.150
We're going to stay here iss If aws cold and secure transport it's force then deny access.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.460
So that's it.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.880
Here.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.650
I'm going to go ahead and synthesize my stack.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.290
So all is good.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.270
We should be able to deploy before going head and deploying it.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.830
What I want to show is in the s three service We have something called us block public

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.760
access settings.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.910
You can see here I have turned on one of the first to off them on the other tour off What

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.220
Basically this means is any issues that are popping issues for a particular object will be

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.950
denied.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.020
If you are putting anything in a packet level are cross account level.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.350
It is not going to be checked eso because we are trying to create some bucket with the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.220
public access.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.310
So this is one important sitting on.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.770
Likewise,

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.990
each bucket will also have in public access,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.030
allow or deny on if you see here when I'm creating the pocket I'm not creating any public

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.880
access Dely.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.950
So if you're going to try this demo,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.190
just be mindful of these two factors So let me go ahead and deploy the stack now So we got

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.790
our stack completed.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.780
Let us go toe our court formation service on the letters Just take it out.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.290
We have a stack is complete Onda we had three baguettes earlier.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.550
Let me just so let me a reef fresh this green.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.270
So we have our new bucket here So you can see here There's a public access mentioned

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.190
because we have added and public access privileges on it should highlight here or so.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.650
So if I go to my permissions on goto packet policy,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.460
we should have to policies here.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.630
So you can see here for all principles we have.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.740
Get object for start artist email on then.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.400
We also have a deny for his https Hess TTP request.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.850
So I know that I have no objection.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.940
So what I'm going to do is I'm going toe upload couple of objects.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.420
So in this suppositories,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.550
there is a boot subscript and under that,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.610
I have created an index dot html on installed chastity.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.550
Peter bases.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.960
That is what I'm going to upload right now.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.580
Yeah,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.130
like what?

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.840
Off them open on.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.550
I'm not ending any privileges or anything.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.940
I'm just going to upload them.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.090
So they're applauded here on.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.130
I'm just going to take that you are off this one.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.830
First on,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.330
I'm going to go to my private bro self on.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.250
What it here.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:56.820
So this is the familiar you're that we used earlier for taking our web servers.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.580
And you can see here my web server or that static pages working on you can see here that is

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.340
in a secure symbol that means that decide to secure with https transport.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.610
So if I just copy this,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.950
you're looking and put it into the process you consider said history D B s that.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.860
So if I go ahead and remove this s and then try to access the space,

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.670
I was most probably get the page cannot be despite her access tonight because you can see

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.090
here.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:24.710
So the reason for that is we have created and secure transport ical toe force on it is why

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.900
it is rejecting the traffic on If I just go ahead and perfect it with safety.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.650
T P s on the foot double coolers.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.320
We should be able to access the bridge.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:34.990
Likewise,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.160
this is a hasty A modified so that if we were able to access it If I go back here,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.640
I also created on other fine,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.150
which is not s edge.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.790
So I'm just going to copy this urine on,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.130
then put in here.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.880
I should get access denied better.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.420
That is how you create I am resource policies in this case as three pocket policy.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.920
If you have any trouble,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.920
go ahead and put them in the Q and a section.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.740
I will look into it or the community will look into it that help you with that.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.860
Thanks for watching.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.850
Happy learning
