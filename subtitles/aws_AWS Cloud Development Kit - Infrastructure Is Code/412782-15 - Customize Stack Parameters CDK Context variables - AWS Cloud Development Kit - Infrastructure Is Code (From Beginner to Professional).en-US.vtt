X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
and a fault.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.950
But come back.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.510
Let's talk about the motor parameters that been using in our stacks.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.750
Whether it is an estimate bucket Bradley Oneto Inform the stack whether the encryption has

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.080
to happen or the questioning has to happen.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.550
Or if you're trying to create and BBC,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.020
then you need to pass on the information of What is this the idea or how many subjects you

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.730
need on which celebrities are still subject has to spread all those parameters that you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.950
need to pass through the stack.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.000
If it is a conventional ah cloudformation templates,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.270
you will have a parameter sections on.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.660
If it is in single stack,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.630
you will have the user to input it or you'll feel some default values are in your CSE

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.110
pipeline.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.850
You have that,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.730
but when it comes to see a,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240
you need to approach parameters slightly differently.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.060
Last lecture.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.500
We saw how you can pass on the core numbers on the region where the stock is to be deployed

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.480
in the app dot the way fine.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.160
But in my opinion that this matter really good practice because you know,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.010
one of heart called your values and all over the place because it becomes very difficult

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.660
for somebody to come and edit it.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.130
So this is where city get a protest,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.080
the whole ecosystem of parameters differently.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.930
You have two options before going and choosing this one.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.000
You also have a diameter store that is available the head of your service.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.450
Then you can have all your configuration parameters well up there,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.450
or if you want to keep it in the APP,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.530
call itself,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.150
then that is also possible.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.950
Let's go back to our project to see when we can store this values.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.700
So this is a product sector that we have been using on here.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090
You can see here we have an environment very well.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.550
Where were mentioning the phone number on region on everything You want to make a change.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.020
You want to actually make their change appearance of.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.880
But if it is possible to move on this comfortable values outside the abstraction,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.350
it's really great.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.950
So that is where the city gate or Gestion file comes.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.050
If you remember earlier,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.660
we used this while to disable the telemetry,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.120
reporting to interview us.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.650
We can use a file a game for sending some more information to your AB,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.110
for example,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.900
what we can do this they can add another Key Caldas context on inside this context,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.870
we can add any number off Jason Key value pair here.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.480
So if you're familiar with the fight on,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.390
just go ahead and create some keys and values.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.200
So the first key I'm going to creators,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.370
I'm going to customize might do environment here that I say This is my 10th on.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.600
Then,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.220
inside this,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.080
I'm going to say region on if you remember our debt region or skewers east one on likewise

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.550
my background or so it's going to be there.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.940
I'm just going to put in my phone number for deaf,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.130
so I'm done with my day.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.760
So I'm going to go to my product,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.970
which will have more values.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.630
For example,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.370
for product.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.710
I will add values like encryption became a ski and all those things,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.990
so that is quest to the D force that it's for region on.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.870
If you remember,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.770
my bucket was investing region,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.060
so I'm just going to have the same thing you west one on then the account.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.010
So we have account value here,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.680
so I'm going tohave an encryption value order to make sure in case I want.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.130
Oh,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.690
check sometimes Then I can say that encryption is going to be true for my broad bucket on.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.620
If I guess I will have a custom key that needs to be used for all my encryption values.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.090
Then I'm going to say this is my custom,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.690
Caymus Air and that every position to use in their applications for inculcating So this is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.270
going to be in values just populace,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.650
and put it from my bucket.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.590
I'm finally just as example If you want to have mention your IPCC a year or so,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.240
what you have to do is I'm just going to mention something like this.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.250
Vpc underscores the idea.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.870
Onda inspectors.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.280
Okay,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.920
$10.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.480
83.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.700
It is used this later.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.450
I'm just going to fill in the values here.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.050
I was supposed to put it docked here,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.700
so we got on Jason,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.790
you're created here.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.530
So how do we access these values into our app dot Be WiFi.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.360
So if you go here and then I'm just going to show you a sample just going to rent it out

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.550
until your app.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.720
Supposedly it should be inside your app,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.660
not they're just people.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.150
It here.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.610
It will be,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.150
um,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.460
not know dot Cry on,

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:26.180
get context on a Let us pick up some values for production.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.700
So just going to say you are on We know that products additionally,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.850
so I'm just going to get the value for region.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.360
Let me say this and then I'm just going to proceed ikea others So it should print out the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.420
value off.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.450
Our reason here so we have to do is we're just going to copy this.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.010
Andi,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.750
you just going to replace this with you here?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.850
Likewise for regional soon for a cannibalism is going to change toe account.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.030
So this way,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.130
now you can see here.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.270
My after FBI file is completely custom.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.350
My steps on it picks values dynamically from the context.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.280
While since we're using the ab note,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.150
I'm just going to move it inside the app initialization structure.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.480
Likewise.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.050
Let's just move this one also.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.650
Yeah,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.650
just going to duplicate this so we can say with some typing there.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.740
Well,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.040
it does.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.550
It does.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.550
I do so if I don't My silicate Ellis.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.100
Everything is good,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.940
but an immature values are picked up,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.910
So it is not just in the app flying.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.130
We can access this context.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.700
Valuables.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.650
You can go ahead,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.440
access the context variables in your conflict it's have here.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.010
This concept is creating an artifact of packets tax so you can access those valuables like

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.480
was just to demonstrate how to access it on the other doors and slow for Abby Here You just

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.850
say self dart.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.740
No,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.650
don't try and get context.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:08.490
So we want to say I want to this time get my game is here so that I would be able to use it

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:17.830
Just going to print this value so that to affiliate endless and let us see if we can get

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.050
the game us by the printer.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.550
You can see here once it is compiling this concept and then it is compelling.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.250
The absolute gets up until again.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.630
So what I'm going to do with this game this now is earlier.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.910
If you room where we're inflicting or back it with an F three manage keys,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.330
they say this time I want 00 in front or my pocket with custom game huskies.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.710
If I goto my pocket here to seize the bucket you're talking about earlier we depart this

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.200
bucket.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.740
If I goto properties on you.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.680
Consider the default aggression is a storm 56.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.780
We don't want that selected school back here on,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.110
uh,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.750
it is.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.450
Go ahead and say this when he was going to be my came Askey.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.140
So before that,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.980
we need to import our became a ski here.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.250
We just do that.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.950
Samed.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:16.050
Let me just say Mikey equal to cameras in the score key.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.840
Start from key Aaron on the school for self On that,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.850
I'm just going to move.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.320
Name my key,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.790
Haley.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.400
And then here is my heir.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.520
And when you can see here,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.130
we have done our key.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.140
We have done our school,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.790
but and we need to fill in the game a scare on for air,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.720
and you're just going to get it from here,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.210
So I'm just going to copy that.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.110
I put it here,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.020
So no need to sprint value on the one where I have already installed the cameras.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.730
If you don't have an audio clip in store,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.260
it appears TK Dark it of yours.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:53.980
IPhone game.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.450
Lis,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.390
make sure that you're installing it.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.040
Otherwise we'll be getting ever here.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.350
So we got no aqui,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.550
so I'm just going to change this tool,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.580
not game us on that.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.180
If you mention it s Caymus,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.510
then you need to mention that encryption key also here.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.720
I'm going to say Mikey,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.350
So let's just confine this.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.730
I'm going to deploy my brought stack.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.970
So the core formation is triggering a change.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.350
Once it is updated little school and stayed out there,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.150
it's completely letters.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.300
Goto s three bucket.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.750
Let us leave this page,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.650
pacifists.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.170
Okay,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.410
Anyway,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.200
we don't have a property space open.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.190
So you can see here already has changed UK Muskie's.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.050
If I call here,

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.500
it will show me the custom air and key automatically.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.970
And then it is already showing the air and that we put in our context variable here.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:50.760
So that is how you permit rise your application stack and pick those parameters in run time

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.970
in your stack and took part in.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.020
You can go ahead and check it out in your broad stack.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.090
Or so it would be already configured here.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:03.260
So I really move as much parameters as possible from your stack itself to your syndicated

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.460
or Jason file so that in one time you can change those values depending upon the

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.050
environment.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.790
on the for example,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.720
we chose the encryption key and passed on his product.
