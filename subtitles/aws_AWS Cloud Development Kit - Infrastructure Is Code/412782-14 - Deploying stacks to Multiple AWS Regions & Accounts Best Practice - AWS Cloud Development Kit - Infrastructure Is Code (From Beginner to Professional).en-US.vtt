00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
Hello,

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.870
folks,

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.850
Welcome back we have been seeing How do you see the gate to create resources on deployed

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.070
into our environment?

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.320
We also went ahead and saw that how you can create stacks for different environments on

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.700
change.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.640
The attributes of the resource is depending upon the environment.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.690
We are deploying,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.780
taking this one step for the Let's go ahead and see what best practices that you can follow

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.950
When you were particularly deploying for production environment,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.780
.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.170
they just go back though the project that we have been working with so in this project you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.090
will notice that the region variable is,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.990
Bean said.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.300
In the environment,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.660
there is a reason for that.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.540
On that is,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.000
if you're used to provide on City is going to take the region that is configured in your

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.150
profile at deployed that environment or the stack in that region until,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.870
for example,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.450
if I go ahead and say aws gone figure list hyphen life and provide run,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.250
let us there.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.730
This is a profile I want to use for Department of Fraud.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.840
Enlightment on you can see here the default region is us east.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.190
But I don't want to deploy my stack and uses for production.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.350
Let's say I want to go to Europe.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.130
Then you have to inform City Gate that the stock is going to be divided Europe.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.600
Otherwise it will go ahead and do it uses.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.410
So that is one reason you need to mention the region.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.430
Another best practice that you can follow is you can go ahead and mention the account

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.550
number also,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.610
that the stock is going to be deployed,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.100
right?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.260
This has been given the documentation or so you can go ahead and check it out.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.850
So I'm going to show you how you can do that in your app.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.150
So first of all,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.140
it is clean it up a little bit for Europe,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.480
that is.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.020
No Easter services has to be breast.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.330
So it's Let me just quickly clean my stack here on to be consistent.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.470
I'm just going to make this also two characters.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.220
So for production that they say I want to deploy it and Ireland.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.790
So this is going to be you know,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.180
you on.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.050
Do we have to add our account number also So the assassin bless playing hard and staying

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.420
account number on goat.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.910
So let me grab my phone number.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.290
Yeah,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:15.250
like when they just had a phone number for production stack.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.840
So,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.390
like my phone numbers for a one amendment hours have gotten our phone number for by

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.580
production environment.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.660
So if I both had it deployment production stack now,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.450
before that,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.340
you just go ahead and do with cities.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.060
And so this will go ahead and create my stack on.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.050
I've figured out one anything that you might want to notice if you're just playing around,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.220
If you go to your stack and at this line there's a removable to seek or don't remove policy

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.030
to destroy.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.850
It is going to attempt destruction off your s three bucket if there is no content.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.410
So you gonna go ahead and try it out for a test.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.650
Environments for production.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.540
Be mindful that any bucket that created that bucket name was lost.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.980
You will not be able to get it.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.720
So I recommended to keep it for retain for production anyway,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.530
that that's for a different topic.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.830
So going back here,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.390
let this go ahead and deploy our production stack.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.400
So in this case,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.470
I'm going to go to production on Go ahead,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.100
J hyphen,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.830
hyphen for flying fried before I go ahead and present.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.350
Let s go to our told commission service an island and see any services there.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.670
So the Iron Virginia,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.060
let us go to Ireland.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.550
Now,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.800
as you can see,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.640
your island does not have any stacks unlike wise.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.310
And when you also we do not have any artifact bucket o r any static bucket here.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.050
So let's go ahead and deploy or stack and come back and check it out there.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.640
And remember,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.910
The interesting thing is the bucket name spaces global by the pocket itself hasn't region

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.370
affinity.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.070
So it is going to get created on a particular region.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.750
Just go ahead and take the resource itself.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.750
Let us go back over a count now so you can see it is completed.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.330
So let me go ahead and refreshment base here.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.280
Nothing is going to happen.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.650
Let's go to Ireland.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:24.270
So in Ireland you can see your my product bucket that has been created on.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.080
Likewise,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.500
I should have a resource here.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500
You can see here interviews,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.550
history If I could take you to my mystery bucket service.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.560
Andi,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.070
I should have brought back it.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.150
And you can see this is the Ireland region where the market has been created.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.860
So I have made my stack born into a particular account on also bound to in particular

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.560
region.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.040
So any time I deploy the stack would be confident that this stock is going to go to a

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.290
particular region or leave.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.240
How so?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.950
This is kind of certainty that you want in.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.450
They are production stacks,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.690
so go ahead and four of these best practices.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.990
If you have any problems,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.050
put them in the comments.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.620
I'll try and help them with you.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.520
Until then,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.270
thanks for watching Happy learning.
