00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hello Falls.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome back.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.210
So far,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.100
we have been using city care for creating a single stack for a particular environment.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.550
On were being playing around with only one resource and customizing it.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.590
Can we use city game for multiple environments?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.260
For example,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.160
if you're running an application quite often,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
that will be their environment test environment on then production,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.220
also on the resources that are required,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.630
will be different,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.460
or it can be having more attributes.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.100
For example,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.450
if you take an extra bucket,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.050
invest in one minute.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.200
You not want encryption.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.030
Maybe not questioning as well,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.850
or you'll world want to retain the resources after the people see or testing is completed.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.410
But when you go to production,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.350
you would want have features like encryption on also wishing on maybe an M afraid elite.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.470
Our attention,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.050
given the total mission stack is getting deleted,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.220
so you will have different requirements for different elements.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.900
How we can do this in Syria,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.850
get that is what we're going to see now.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.210
And I think of a scenario where we haven't full stack developer on.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.470
The developer is going to create a perfect bucket stack on deploy that bucket into when

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.520
they win when meant as well to a production environment on both of them are in different

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.960
interviews,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.090
accounts That is a key here on let us in.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.960
But using the CT crescent commanded all the birds is creating the S three bucket stack on.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.100
Then they would go ahead and issue the command to deploy it using the profile for they went

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.930
lineman on then also used the profile for production environment on deployed blood.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.510
When you're deploying it in production,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.800
we will have a different attributes.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.000
Add it to the stack.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.720
Dan immediate.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.250
We will not have hard putting for these two buckets.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.290
Just the burning of one with And when mature getting deployed to check on her getting it

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.820
deployed.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.180
You will add more features our remove or features from that a stack.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.150
So let's go ahead and see how we can do this in our account.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.290
This is the democratic that they have been playing around with.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.010
And I cleaned up all the resources on the outputs that we have.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.240
We don't have any resources in this a stack.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.470
I just deleted everything s so that we can go ahead and simulate a fresh artifact bucket

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.450
stack that we're going to deploy the cell demo before going in.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.900
To do that,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.850
I'm want introduce you to my accounts.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.220
This account is going to be one of my environments on.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.290
You can see here that are relieved.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.120
Seven begets let us get northeast.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.800
Three packets were now on their Likewise,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.100
I deleted all this access.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.470
Will we just have one really two stacks on this account.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.270
You can see here.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.210
This is a different account.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.980
CTK tail.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.070
That's the name says it is going to be the environment on that.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.470
I know stacks adult here and no x three buckets.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.370
So if I go back here on day,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.560
I have also created the enemy's provides.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.630
So Aws s three less profiling them That should be coming back empty because there are no

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.460
buckets like ways.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.100
If I go ahead and do it for Ron,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.110
I should have the seven,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.950
but gets listed.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.170
So we have about our intimacy lisetta that just go ahead and start writing Overcoat here.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.990
The first thing is,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.480
I no longer want to call this as my civic A voice product.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.400
I'm just going to call it my artifact,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.040
but get But I defects Tag.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.200
Oh,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.620
so we need to change this indoor app also,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.890
because they're important this stack and tore up not be wine,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.970
but we could do that later.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.430
Let us go ahead and edit it.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.440
But we need anti word.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.000
For example,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.220
I have introduced a key word here is you can see it is prodding or to force.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.550
You can have any keyword that you can want to pass on to your stack so that you can take

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.650
appropriate actions.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.490
It can be easy encryption falls Or do you want is questioning enabled false or anything so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.930
you can pass on any values and use those values to create your stack itself for So this is

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.850
a string value.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.650
So what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to say if it is broad,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:05.020
So I'm going to create an artifact bucket here on this is going to be my letter.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.770
Say this is going to be my prod and the fact,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.450
but can't.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.940
So because this is going to be my broad.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.720
I'm just going to say,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.170
washing equal toe crew on.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.790
Then I'm going to add encryption.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.450
Also,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.660
if I'm not wrong,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.150
it is but get encryption and then I'm going to say s three managed.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.620
Unlike wise,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.840
I don't want my production pocketed Toby remote when the stock is telling,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.150
that's going to say a moon policy is going to be retained.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.360
It is.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.190
I think it is removal policy on then I want to use them,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.300
retain value here.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.880
So that center for my broad value.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.150
So if it is what broader said toe false,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.660
I just want to create my artifact bucket.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.650
Andi,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.770
I'm just going to say one of the defaults.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:12.050
So this is going to be my Devon Weinman ratified pocket so then sent.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.940
So we have set up or cord in such a way that when we are saying that is broadly was true

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.650
automatically,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.040
these parameters will be set up on when the value is falls.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.680
It is not going to set up these parameters for basically,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.450
bushing is going to before it's an encryption will not be there on the clock for minutes is

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.460
deleted about the stock is doing it.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.240
Will Adams to delete the artifact like it also So now we're set here.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.210
So let us go back to our thought p y on then you feel you can see here.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.920
This is giving us an error.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.570
What we need to do is we need to import our classy A properly.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.120
So this is the worst last name.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.800
So I'm just going to change this year instead of calling this generally in my CD Cape

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.340
Project.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:04.720
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to call this as my dough stock on when you're having

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.500
multiple stature.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.610
When people environments,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.490
it is mandated to set up the environment variable here.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.560
The reason for that The city needs to know that it needs to deploy this a stack and which

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.820
environment if you don't know how that environment that will send up it is going to take up

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.590
your Abdul default profile on Diffuse that.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.270
So in this case,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.370
I'm having two different device on It is possible that you might want to use engineer for

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.790
your taste in women on the island for your protection and Weinmann so it allows you to

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.820
customize stores bad news on,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.250
uh,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.570
provide them in during one time.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.480
So the enemy is the key word.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.060
So let me just go ahead and say on he and remaining Well,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.350
here,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.710
let us say for the deployment us.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.350
I'm just going to say core dot and Veron meant,

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:57.180
and then I'm just going to say Wenjun equal to it was East one.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.940
So what I can do is I can just do get this and then say,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.950
if I wanted to ply this in Europe,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.250
let me take properly.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.320
So I'm willing to say you I'm not sure the region names of bread.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.770
You best one or east one that the same.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.310
Just I'm not going to use Europe by that is how you customize it on then here,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.320
whatever does just going to call you and likewise,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.750
I'm going to duplicate this again.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.160
I'm just going to say this is my broad stack.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.640
So we have duplicated out stack.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.250
Basically,

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.190
I can synthesize and those stack as well at the broad stack as well on.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.340
Then,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.490
when I'm doing a broad stacked,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.900
what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass one more variable,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.310
as is Broad is broad equal.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.190
Do true here because of me.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.790
Want the Prada with encryption back on the worsening,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.370
so just going to pass on the valuable.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.860
So when the stock is getting created have all those additional attributes.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.700
So let's go ahead and listen to size our stack.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.890
If everything is good,

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.440
we should have two stacks here listed for us.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.750
So here we have my nails tacked on,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.750
then broad stacked.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.130
No,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.540
we have synthesised Let us go ahead and quit.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.150
You have a look at the template itself that has been generated.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.250
If you go here,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.290
you will find that that will be to them places the 11 which we don't need it.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.170
So it should be getting rid off despite anyway.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.670
But we have a stack for Mike.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.610
They'll stack template on.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.460
Then you see here under there was that that is no washing control,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.120
o r.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.440
That it's Noah.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.950
Encryption on the delusion policy is by default is retain.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.330
If you don't update it on Dallas people to my production,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:42.160
you can see here that is in a property for encryption on then that is a property for

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.640
question control or so so it automatically generates two different told formation templates

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.480
with one single cold on their uses.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.260
The amount of therefore that you want to customize your templates for different and wife

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.280
wants whether it is there that stop fraud.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:56.930
Now,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.220
let me,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.200
however stacks.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.470
Let us go ahead on deploy them.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.890
So for deploying it is interviews City did reply on,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.870
then followed by my stack name.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.850
So let's go ahead and apply our does back first when you use the don't for a fight.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:22.700
So remember when I'm doing it in the Dell profiler is not going to be questioning our

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.350
encryption.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.780
So this,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.250
uh,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.140
go to our there.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.950
When women this is off their environment,

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.400
we should have a new stand.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.690
You consider order in my deal.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.950
Stock is getting created.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.930
If I go to my resources,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.480
we should have one bucket.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.720
So let me go ahead.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.510
And when does here?

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:54.760
So the properties aboard the wishing and encryption should not be there if assuming the

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.150
seconds complete here.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.450
So what a fresh here there is not done.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:00.850
Black.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.480
Likewise.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.440
I'm just going to deploy it for my pride stack now,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:14.160
So see if he can to pry Ron from when to use a broad profiling.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.650
So I changed.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.370
It is greeted.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.700
Letters,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.540
court overcoat,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.640
formation resources.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.350
This is in this account.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.750
So the drone accounts is going to be a broader environment.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.660
Let me refresh.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.150
The prospect is getting deployed.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.890
Let's check whether our defect bucket is there.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:38.370
So my product stacked bucket So we should have one more bucket to just acting with my broad

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.950
stack.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:44.590
Here it is that there's go inspect the properties here on you can see here the worsening is

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.020
unable on the default.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.550
Encryption is culture set.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.450
So basically,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.600
if you notice what you have done is we just returned the cold ones.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.180
But we're able to dynamically change attributes off.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.480
The temperatures were deploying depending upon the environment.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.690
So you can do this for any other source that you can imagine,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.420
for example,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.340
for production.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.740
You will.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.890
I wanted to play and be PC without an Internet gateway are without some public access

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.760
support resources letters in there,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.030
one Sandbrook In one month,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.780
you would want to attach an elastic I P or Internet gateway so that you can do some

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.610
experimentation,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.900
so it makes it really,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.090
really customizable.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.490
Go ahead and trying Monday environments in your account.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.800
If you have any problems,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.940
put them in the comments.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.410
I try and help them and you in the next Demel literacy.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.280
How we can take this concept a little bit further on.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.790
See how we can have money with stacks in this team CD.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.750
Get project bite for different types of resources.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.090
So far,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.080
we're just playing around with every back later school head and start building some other

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.780
sources and see how we can combine all this concept that there seems so far.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.690
Until then,

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.450
thanks for watching Happy learning.
