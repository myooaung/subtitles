00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hello,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.510
folks.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.750
Welcome back.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.160
We have been hearing a lot about AWS CTK on how it can revolutionize the provisioning off

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.280
infrastructure by using really cold it is.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.110
Go ahead and get started on DSI.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.330
What is required to do that in your development machine?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.800
Whether you're using a laptop or desktop,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.350
our Cloud nine environment one of the main things that you need to have in your laptop so

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
that you can start quoting in seeing again that is what we're going to see today on it is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.490
highly opinionated view because when you're talking about programming languages that are

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.200
many options,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.210
as we saw earlier,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.250
City Gate can be done and Jaguar by.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.740
Don't go darknet on all those languages.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.870
So this predict was said M O is going to be highly opinionated on.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.110
We're going to do that in a line X based laptop we're going to use by.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.300
Don't ask our primary development language it is.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.150
Go ahead and see what all the things that are required when you're talking about

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.970
prerequisites,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.000
some off them are listed here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630
One is an aws see lay on.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.720
Then you also need an AWS account for experimentation on also user with privileges to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.370
provision resources in your account on you also needed nor Jace environment.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.670
It is going to take the poor,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.410
whatever language you're writing it and then working it into a JavaScript on.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.160
Then from there it gets converted into court formation.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.090
You don't need to know about all those things you just need no Jay's installed on your

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.650
laptop.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.660
I show you in a short,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.770
wide if you don't have it,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.750
how to install it or from where you can get it.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.480
And then we also need an I d tool kit that you can attach to your I d on then the runtime

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.040
environment.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.680
In this case,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.670
it is going to be fighting.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:48.100
So the first really quizzically the school hadn't see it and a WC like So I am going to use

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.010
no Lennox laptop.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.540
So the Arab Lucille is already in salt.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.380
So just if you don't have with if you want to confirm it,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.590
I'm in my terminal,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.350
so I'm just going to run aws configure on.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.760
If you are getting a prompt,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.290
then it means that it has been already installed on configured with your kids.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.710
So if you don't have the keys.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.450
This is what I meant by having an account with privileges.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.780
Go ahead and get your access key and secret key on.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.490
Go ahead and configure them on for the rest of the demos.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.850
I'm going to use us East as my primary region on open former can be man as well.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.360
So we have enemies,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.230
Seeley configured and I also have a user configured.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.590
So now that we have a wc l a and also configure it a school head and see what the other

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.630
predict was that we need So no Js we need to have no jay's in your account.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.100
So if you're in Windows,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.540
you can go ahead and get it in the no chase website or if you're in a Mac or some line

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.360
express laptop,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.960
you can use rule on,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.250
then insert nor jays.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.030
So I also have no chase all the insult.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.740
If not,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.150
just go ahead and install it.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.090
So I have no Jay's on the pushing that I have is washing 12.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.410
That should be good enough.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.180
You can see here a strong is your about.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.770
Then we're good to go.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.470
So that is another prerequisite that has been satisfied,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.740
So I d again this is going to be quite a tricky one because everybody has a favorite I d in

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.260
this case.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.580
What?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.620
I'm going to use its visual studio code as we can see here,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.450
the sorts of recommended by the CBK platform.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.970
Because there are some tool kits available,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.140
there are some extensions available.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.290
Other ideas might also have the same thing.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.310
It's up to you Totally.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.470
Which one do you want to use?

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.380
But in this case,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.300
the one that I'm using is I'm assured,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.450
Studio Court And I helped us to my state or for my use case.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.720
So go ahead and choose whichever i d you are comfortable with.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.360
So now that we're done with the I d or so the next political is it is the language.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.120
So if you have noticed it already my i d.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.450
You can see here I have by tone 3.7 or so have by default.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.500
It comes with Piper on 2.7 hold.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.880
So So I can change my room anytime when you're writing a program.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.600
So if you are not having a I don't install,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.290
go ahead and install it on just to show you.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.870
You can see here.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.290
That is the fight on two.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.370
And I also have a fight on three s.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.590
What?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.450
Likewise,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.280
we will need Pip three also.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.760
So if you don't have weapons,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.860
start go ahead and install.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:26.720
Pip and I have configured for board abortion pointing my T 4 to 2.3 point seven so that I

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.150
will always get the latest 3.7 packages.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.090
So you done with idea You are so done with taking the I don't language on there is one more

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.350
important prerequisite when you're talking about right on ISS the virtual environment,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.970
because your city gate is going to create on get triple on.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.850
You are going to install packages in the question environment.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.020
So you will also need fight on which will envy.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.110
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to run these commands in my environment to make

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.680
sure that I have all the latest prerequisites.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.990
So remember this is by default pointing to fight on.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.730
So I'm just going to change it to bite on tree when I'm running it in my environment and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.570
they won't bite on to its deprecate er so I would highly recommend you to go help the juice

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.460
by country as your default as well.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.500
So let this cup,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.940
since I'm using every day CD cape.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.100
Most off the predicted sits in my there were.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.810
Environmental is already installed,

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.150
so if you don't have it in stock than this package will take some time to collect all the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.490
differences and go ahead and install them.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.070
So now we have the which will environment also on.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.850
Then we can go ahead on install Sirikit now.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.650
So to install City Gate,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.340
remember earlier be installed.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.860
No Jay's.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.020
If you're wondering why we're installing OJ's,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.990
this is the reason entire city a court is working on note.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.390
So this is the reason we need NPM install.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.400
So let's just go ahead and copied on.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.940
We needed to be installed globally,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.840
so little school had installed that if you want,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.750
do run it in the electoral environment,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.320
that is what supports it will remove the High Queen G and create a subdirectory on.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.790
You can have a normal city installed on your virtual environment.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.160
Also,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.280
that's also possible.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.100
So now we have installed a CD K.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.660
So if you go ahead and run a city gate washing.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.790
You should be getting in Western number there.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.670
That is one more prerequisite that the city gate code package is dependent on.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.670
We need to go here on install that one as well,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.860
so you can see him.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.800
We have already done the NPM install and Siddiqui washing.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.930
This is the other co dependency.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.410
So I'm just going toe run this on.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.640
Remember my purpose pointing to three.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.450
So if you want to install the fight on three packages,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.950
just make sure you're using the big portion three.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.950
I'm just going to update it.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.670
So now everything is said.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.530
Now we can go ahead and start creating our projects in Abuse city from one words.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.960
So just to confirm everything is good,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.040
I'm just going to get the washings of bill numbers.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.750
Get on.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.370
Remember,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.370
City Gate is getting updated really,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.960
really fast.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.590
That is a lot of developments is happening.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.230
A lot of new features are getting at her,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.590
but fixes are happening.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.840
So on weight off on Amazon,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.060
make sure that it is backwards compatible.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.610
So if you guess if you're stuck up on something and that is a bug and if you're not sure I

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.090
highly recommend you to go ahead and update your city K and try to compile it.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.190
Your daughter formation good again.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.880
So keep your city as close to the latest,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.150
which and it's possible that this will be my recommendation.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.930
So no,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.740
we're done here.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.960
In the next demonstration,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.350
we'll go ahead and start creating or projects and creating your stacks from their own words

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.350
,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.570
actual watching.
