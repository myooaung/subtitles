X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
and the fools when I come back.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.840
So far we have been using City gate the great resources like s three adding some attributes

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.200
like encryption or questioning on.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.570
We also saw halted deployed multiple regions on using the city killer Jason find to add

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.850
some context valuables and important there.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.670
So let us take this one step forward and see how we can create a resource like our VPC on

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.230
how to customize the BBC so that it is highly available on also has unnecessary doubts and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.850
security groups that there.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.780
So this is the documentation for the BBC constrict.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.290
So let us go to bite on.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.850
Politics is just this one line that you see here on you will be able to create a BBC.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.160
But when you're learning or if you want to pride out for your environment,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.810
I recommend you to go ahead and look at all the other attributes that are listed here at

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.940
the top so that you can customize the BBC So,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.480
interational,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.080
I'm going to show you how began building customized,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.790
highly available vpc in your account on.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.120
Remember,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.970
if you're going to use this one link concept,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.020
it is going to create a multiple,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.190
not get with so you.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.210
When your private subjects can communicate to the internet Now then tell me so we can get

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.750
somewhere.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.500
Source help.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.150
When you are creating a VPC,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.650
they just go ahead and start building it in Norco.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.750
So this is the project that you have been playing around with the my city project.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.830
But let us start from scratch.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.140
We're just going to remove this concept so that we have one Lee one networking stack.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.370
So our constructors built under the city get predicted.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.930
It does not to create ever be easy.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.000
Also inside that what I'm going to do is I'm goingto create a lever for the Cordless every

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.990
source stacks so that tomorrow you want to come head and create a easy to instance our

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
ideas instance construct You can go ahead and put them under the resource tax and import

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.380
them as necessary.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.410
So inside this,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.150
I'm going to create a fire going past custom BBC.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.130
So this finest empty now.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.270
So the basic construct off this if I can pick it up from here so this at the four or five

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.440
banks that we eat from this fine,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.550
so let me just remove this.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.500
Let me just change this one.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.860
Also to say Oh,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.050
custom BBC stack on with this is a value that will be passed on earlier.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.300
So we don't need that.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.880
We can use the one line information that we saw in the documentation when the senior value

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.120
was hard quarter in tow.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.650
The construct itself does not do that.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.550
Let's go ahead and use this unique it or the Jason Fire to pull all the parameters like the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.220
sea area,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.730
the mosque on also,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.070
whether you want some results up next for future future usage.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.600
So here we have our context on inside this.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.650
We have a day when alignment of broad environment.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.120
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to create a higher level.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.960
Are dictionary court as environments on said environments,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.780
we will have both our day one prod.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.210
So we started that on in this case.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.940
Let us say I want my broaden.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.060
My much is also going to be in the U.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.240
S.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.820
Pieced one Onda uh,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.630
I'm going to put all maybe busy configuration in one place,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.550
so I'm going to call this VPC conflicts on inside this.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.450
We have a IPCC eight year.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.050
We also need and see ADM ask so that our subjects are excised from this place.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.800
So they say,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.120
I want my CD Master B 24th.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.300
For that I would have to have 26 I p addresses in each submit on my end a c a.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.470
D A rate is going to be slashed 20 so that we can spread it across of my people up with

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.200
pretty sorts.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.510
So room where we can also set another valuable.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.230
This is the custom.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.660
Really Well,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.100
we can use it inside or not later.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.670
Let us say we want a form syndicate not to reserve some subjects for future use.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.790
A.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.760
So I used a central.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.450
So we called the falls on.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.150
We can use these values inside.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.380
So when it is good over a custom bpc that is important context variable.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.150
So that doesn't want the broad can fix.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.990
So my former convicts at that,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.780
So let's go ahead and create our,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.250
uh,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.730
the B C.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.670
So before reading,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.510
we basically need to import a concept.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.730
So the BBC is part of the easy toe construct.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.520
A soldier to school had an important before importing into.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.620
You need to install it as well so that the actors,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.950
when you share they go here on say,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.080
I want easy to install it.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.980
So now we have important if you know where you need to put the common here so that it

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.700
doesn't complain There Andi heroes,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.850
it just underscore.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.300
So the another interesting thing about Michelle studios I can start my imports so that it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.080
is much more easier.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.050
So I don't have to worry about commerce and brackets.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.120
This is how I actually write my course.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.100
So I know clearly what imports are there.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.790
And what is that out of their imported?

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.840
Just go ahead and create or custom BBC.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.190
It is on the upper case.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.150
BP seen on.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.290
Let the scope be to find I'm going to call this custom vpc I d on.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.270
Then we're going to say what is going to be my c idea?

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.660
Ready?

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.550
So if you know where we have broad conflict under port conflicts,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.510
we also have BPC conflicts and to be busy convicts.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.050
We also have a BBC,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.510
see a deer and swell.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.940
So if you were dumped,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.200
you can go in and take it or under the he and me we help run on abroad.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.750
We have ABC conflicts on BBC confident Boch here and also see their mask.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.740
So let's just go ahead on,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.970
say,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.860
how maney availability zones me want to use So we have parameter for that.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.880
We call it Maxie's.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.230
So we'll say we want to use to get over the petitions on since I want a custom BBC with her

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.140
public private and database subheds that for roping my privates up next really incident.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.640
I also need a gnat it with.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.710
So let's just go ahead and say I want to create one night to get with Onda And finally

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.150
we're coming to our subject configuration.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.180
So something is on a list of subjects because that that is going to re public private and

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.630
database.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.550
So just go ahead and start building over suddenly configuration.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.450
So we need to name our sudden it.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.570
So 1st 1 is going to be in my public sub net on the the a.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.420
D A mask.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.360
Everyone were become that already here on,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.850
uh,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:29.900
you just take this and we have something God does see the are underscore Mosque on.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.110
If you're not sure of anything.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.790
You can go ahead and check the documentation.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.030
That is the reason I showed you that you can find the documentation on,

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.710
uh,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.560
what help you can get from the documentation.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.010
So finally,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.150
we're going to tell CD case.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.940
What kind of sudden it this is going to be looking forward is so we can see everything on

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.490
the screen.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.950
So this is going to be in public.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.680
Submit on it is an in home value if you have something.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.790
It dying on dark.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.220
Sure.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.850
How Public There.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.720
Okay,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.800
now we have got our first to publics of nature spread across two easy's.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.950
So what we're gonna do is you can just go ahead and type it completely or just going to

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.350
locate this couple of times.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.910
So I got this as brave it on.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:19.310
Then I did this one also as a private It on this one goes as isolated and this one is going

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.450
to you might db submit Justin more this and say this.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:34.510
So this is all that is required to create and a BBC onder How higher?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.070
Validity.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.600
Also.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.180
So in case if you want to output this vpc so that you can see it as an output construct,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.030
So all you have to do is CF course.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.230
See if we have seen this earlier,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.750
just going ahead and putting it again so that you can do it.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:08:07.780
You can do with custom bc dot BBC Andy and I said,

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:17.210
an export value so we cannot have two values with the same identify.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:24.590
So let me just go ahead and changes put when fixing the BBC would I release the export name

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.990
is having underscores.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.640
Typically,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.460
the export names are not a happy with having having underscore,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.980
so I'm just going to change that one.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.650
Also,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:39.320
the final step is going head and importing or stack in the after two people.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.130
I find it currently they have not people.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.140
If I has my artifact bucket and all that environments,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.570
we don't want that anymore.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.860
So just going to remove these values.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.280
And I don't want my act if it like it also.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.270
So where were we need to import it from resource tax?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:02.910
So let's go ahead and do that resource tax dot custom BBC on Then we have a class called us

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:10.890
accustomed BBC stack so that it's done that this creator stack itself my custom.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.590
Maybe she enquired too.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.650
Okay,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:22.660
let us name our custom BBC or so custom BBC stack.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.850
We're all good here.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.490
I'm sorry,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.750
we don't need a name there.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.930
That isn't to say so.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:33.570
Stack,

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.890
if everything is good and we should have a successful step so they just go ahead and deploy

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.800
our stack.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.080
So when this is deploying,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.790
it may take you to my core commission resource here.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.780
So we should get out.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.980
You start getting creative.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.810
So there's in reviewing progress when the stock is getting evaluated on you can see here.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.210
Right now,

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.540
there is no BBC.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.340
So as soon as my stack gets building resources,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.850
we should start seeing the BBC also getting created.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.590
So right now we are having some substance.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.770
So it just getting Bill did so.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.470
What I'm going to do is just going to wait for some time under the status getting created,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.060
because we are going to get all these resources like a new me BC,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.570
with the DCP options enabled delis enabled six subjects that is spread across both the

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.650
availability zones in Virginia one night get way that is building the problems of net

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.310
roping tables for my public submit pointing to the Internet.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.950
Get away,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:38.370
Ana Old Bone Internet for my private through my night and also some default.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.100
Security groups are initials.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.100
So all these resources are going to create created with those five or 10 lines off course.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.910
If you go to my city,

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:53.040
cannot out that must be on my custom BBC stack dot template.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.850
So if I see here that India struck must be at least 100 200 lines,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.930
you can see your it keeps going.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.490
There's approximately about finder lines,

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.990
of course,

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.220
that has been created for creating justice.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.320
BBC All this is done by city get for us.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.650
So let's go back to your stack,

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.880
Onda.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.450
Hopefully we got all our resources done.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:21.970
So Stack is still in progress to see if our output is done,

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.550
not it.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.230
So it is a matter gator.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.730
So most of other resources that they are already time.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.110
So let's go ahead and check out our PC itself.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.050
So let me just refresh this page.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.720
I'm going to feel that it so that it is easier to navigate for us.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.150
So it is going and check the subjects first.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.720
So you can see here that after 67 answer that we wanted.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.350
So let me go ahead and filter it by public.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.210
So you have those the public subjects.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.310
If I go and check the voting tables,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.550
you should find that just pointing toe investigate with the same thing for this one as well

00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.550
.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.220
It's like Why is that?

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.380
If I go to my,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:02.750
uh,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.990
road Diggins and such for David to this time,

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.760
Why not?

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.640
And should have.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.550
It s a private this way.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:19.450
So we should haven't wrote pointing to the navigator as soon as the matter get with Issa

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.570
published on the roads are added eso because my stack is still getting created So we should

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.450
not be taking this right now.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.570
Oh,

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.710
what I will show you is on a network issue.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.930
We should have and deformed network a seal attached to those subjects like ways I will have

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.920
on security group also that as the default one.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.490
If you want to go ahead and customize it,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.670
you can use the VPC 80 to create additional security groups on subjects.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.700
So I'm just going to wait for one more moment for my 90 Gateway to come online.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:57.930
You can see here this is already available on it is also attached to my custom.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:08.960
BPC integration is complete so they just go back to over noting table on to check our

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.950
privates updates and see if the natural reflecting now.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.870
So you can see here for my private subjects into natural to some pointed at my night And

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.380
that would be the same case for my hat on.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:27.070
Since we don't have value every deal we have not built to Max both our submits or both over

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.520
availabilities order pointing to the same net and you don't have the ability.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.170
So in your goal,

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:38.180
audio to do is just go to our custom resources and changes as a una two nights.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:45.320
Then automatically you will have one more not built in the other submitted it automatically

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:51.340
intelligently chooses the war 80 that is not having and now not so Likewise,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.790
The final thing is whether the old put fiction is also having the value you could see.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.950
Here's the same landing that was built in here.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.840
So this is how you go ahead and create custom resources,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.370
which is really takes Find the length of quarter and as confirmation on build them out and

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.880
see the get right out.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.200
If you have any problems,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.220
put them in the comments.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.050
I'm happy to help them with you.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.330
In the next lecture,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:19.040
we will take this one step forward and see how we can back some off those resources that we

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.150
have burned today.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.750
Thanks for watching.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.350
Happy look.
