00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hello,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.770
folks.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome to another lecture on Sirikit.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.460
Let us see how we can launch Web servers in an auto scaling group.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.790
Friend ended by an application for balance Self.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.770
There are reasons why you want such an architecture.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.650
Let's say you have launched in the publication on it.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.790
This become quite popular and you're getting a lot of hits from your users.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.740
So in that case,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.780
you want the scale of your Web server to meet all the traffic demand.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.280
I'm quite often in interview is the best way to do that is using an order scaling group on

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.280
.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.850
Whenever you have an auto scaling group,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.290
you would want to have a Northern so that that's a single point of entry on orders.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.990
Killing Group can also help check your servers to see whether they are only available,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.550
unable to meet the requirements off your users in terms off agency and performance.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.430
So let's go ahead and see how we can burn this in our city.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.100
Haystack architecture that we're going to build is going to look something like this.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.710
So we have a user who is going to hit the obligation nor balancer domain name,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.550
or that you are.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.990
You can also have a role captivity.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.580
But we're not going to do that today.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.540
So we have a load balancer behind the load balancer.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.600
We have my different observers,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.540
general Part Often.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.450
Order Skating Group.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.150
So these are the two confident that we're going to build in today's picture.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.480
So this is a tear off over application.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.480
I could picture whatever then so far is just imported the bootstrap scripts on Also,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.930
I have imported online exam.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.260
So our web servers basically going to run on online extend my so for building and load

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.810
balancer.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.350
Obviously we need to import the balance of construct so that the school had on do that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.850
first.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.610
So we're going to use the distribution of the load balancer Onda.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.130
We also need to import the I am construct as well as the auto scaling construct,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.650
because we're going to use those functionality as well so into school head and import them

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.650
.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.750
So we have important the necessary constructs.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.120
Remember,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.290
whenever you're importing a new contract and if you just not install,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.600
it is imperative that you need to go ahead and ask them to requirements and struck them.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.190
So we went toe act them here sort of later.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.400
School hadn't had auto scaling first,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.700
followed by the north balancer.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.150
So let me say this on before we do anything else that we just go ahead and install it.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.970
So my contacts have been installed.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.440
So let me just for this.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.030
So they just go back to our Web application.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.450
So little start building on load balance that the question is creating the load balancer.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320
So I'm going to call it my Lord balancers MB on.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.120
Then we went to import of a concept he'll be was too dark application load,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.850
balancer.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.600
And of course,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.190
we always start with the scope followed by the I.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.490
D.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.700
I'm just going to call this as they'll be.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.350
Andi.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.470
We have one to say whether it is which BBC descriptive.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.660
But you can see here I have,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.620
importantly pc from the BBC stack.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.370
So all I'm going to say it's PPC equal to be PC's.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.460
So so and maybe see which is existing in my environment can be used by this construct

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.950
easily unstoppably and BBC again and again.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.500
I'm going to say this is going to be Internet facing,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.950
so I'm going to say true Yeah,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.180
on what is going to be my load balancer name.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.190
I'm going to call this as if so where?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.770
And be so What we're going to do next is we're going toe.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.650
Allow the security group to receive traffic and port 80 from the Internet.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.350
So and we don't connections dot Hello from Internet.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.460
Once again,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.850
we're going to other Only I'd be before traffic.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.510
So under this,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.150
we're going to say easy to dark portrait DCP on bought in India.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.650
They just add a description so that we know why we have added this.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.140
So now we are done with security group,

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:06.380
so next is adding and listener So here we are going to say listener equal to get be dot Add

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:18.250
listener on the listening name is going to explain to the list i d bordered by just my port

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.950
and whether they want to open their tour whether just open or not,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.950
they're just accepting traffic or not.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.850
So we have added a listener as well.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.270
So the next step is going ahead and start building the necessary resources for our order.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.950
Skilling Group So for my auto scaling room,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.080
there are few people prerequisites for example,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.080
we need to know what is am I am going to launch.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.240
What if the Bootstrap scripts?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.090
What is the role?

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.860
What is the excess?

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.550
Its key.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.930
So we have got a couple of those Is that despite here,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.800
the next step is I'm going to build the road.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.650
So I'm just going to say But so were I am ruler.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.820
So we're going to use that I am constructs.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.000
I am dot role I followed by my school when they're just going to have an i d.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.450
Here.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:18.890
So here we are going to say this is going to be assumed by my service,

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.250
which is easy to so I am not service principle.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.500
Easy to door a measure on AWS.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.190
Start calm on.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.100
We're going to add a couple of manage policies were seen this earlier.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.940
Help to advance policies on that one is going to be my assistant policy.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:51.340
Another one is going to be my daily access for history policy name from manage 14 and

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.550
that's what I came for.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.790
So I'm going to copy business one so that it won't make a mistake here for a systems it's

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.440
called us.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.550
Racism managed instance score on just going to do to get this.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.940
So we also have Amazon s trade or read only access here.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.590
So we got our Web server role also.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.930
Really?

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.130
The next step is going ahead and believe the order's getting group.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.950
Except So let's start by that.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.650
I'm going to call this as a Web server auto scaling group.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.220
And you have the construct called this auto scaling on under that,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.200
I'm going to say Auto scaling Group.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.430
Yeah,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.850
plus the one followed by my i d.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:47.990
So I mean,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.180
Mitch,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.390
maybe you want to run it.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.110
So this is the BBC on here.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.770
You can see here help keep them.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.320
But I don't want to do that because I'm going to use a systems patients manager because I

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.590
have against this role and I'm using Amazon.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.070
My next on the agent comes in default,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.410
so I should be able to manage my service by using the SSN vision's manager.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.000
So I'm not going to add a keen him.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.700
If you want to go ahead and add a key,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.250
them did.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.970
So it's something I want to run it.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.930
And so basically,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.070
you can choose whether they want to find it and breaks up next public separates or

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.550
whichever subjects being wand.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.540
So in this case,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.940
I'm going to put them into,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.450
uh oh,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.240
Private seven.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.640
It's because,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.750
my lord balance that is going to be public facing.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:35.000
So if you do not select subjects election Uh,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.230
yeah,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.230
here we are going to say something to type.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:43.850
Is it a sudden it time is going to do pregnant.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.270
So that said for the subjects.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.670
So next step is instance time What type of instance I want to run.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.400
So basically here you if you're familiar with orders getting group were feeling the launch

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.850
configuration on then the auto scaling group configurations in all in one place.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.360
So the instant state was going to meet my group.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.730
I'm going to run a small instance.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.410
If you want to have a different sense,

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.520
go ahead and change them should not be a problem.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:09.910
Instead,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:18.810
style certainty.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.870
Doing my girl camp It does not make a spelling error.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.490
Do my throat.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.950
Did you go there?

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.610
On what mission?

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:30.940
Image?

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.110
We have already imported our machine image just going to say my necks.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.540
Am I here on what role we have already defined the role.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:46.270
Also observer role on what capacity wanted.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.950
Just choose the minute capacity first in the past,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.650
I'm going to say two on then max capacity.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.280
Also,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.030
I'm going to say to on,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.780
Do you want to know how decided field?

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.070
But if you said this well,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.260
whenever you're launching this tack,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.880
it is going.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.730
If you have water,

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.460
scaled it from two to let us a higher number,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.270
then it is going to put the skating group back into his desire number,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.700
so I wouldn't recommend you to go ahead on the tool that is,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.690
I have capacity,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.750
unless you're sure what you're doing.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.980
So finally,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.300
before we forget the needle at the Usage Data field also here,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.240
let's So let's go ahead and on our use elevators for that.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.060
Our instance will pick up the latest 80 TPD packages and become a Web server.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.850
So we have seen this already.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.850
Also say that equal to orders for season two dot user data Dark custom.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.660
Under this,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.420
we just give the user data value that we already picked up somewhere in the beginning,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.420
you can see here we're reading from the fire under storing the value.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.330
It is a data,

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.350
so I'm just passing it on here.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.460
So we got our auto scaling group set up.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.320
The next step is enabling daughter's getting group to receive traffic from the board

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.810
balancer.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.250
So we're going to add a comment here to say,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.950
Donald SG Security Group,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:13.410
Did they see you Graphic brown and be so we can say lips ever SG Dr Connections Dark Hello

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.950
from envy.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.280
If you can go up here,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.180
you will find out that is an l b there.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:28.950
And then we are going to say from easy does not board dot TCP port 80 on the lettuce.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.110
Add a description also.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:37.850
So we know that this is the part off the it be security group.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:45.250
I'm just going to add the same description.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.090
Here it is.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:49.980
Closest out.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.510
So this is good.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:58.340
So we need to add or auto scaling group Toby the targets for our lord balancer so we can

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.290
see here that is already listening at it.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.300
So we're going to say,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:01.630
Listen,

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.250
don't act target groups.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:16.580
So listener so listener I d followed by my fort matter.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.510
I'm going to listen So again it's going to be on port 80 then where we're not going to do

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.320
any certificates.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.480
So it is going to be one Lee.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:23.860
What?

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.020
80 were doing certificates and you will go under.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:32.300
Add another 44443 Also So the targets and going toe attachment reps over SG.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.750
So now we have a test.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.060
Our the scaling instances toe are listening.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.030
So I'm just going to add a comment here.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.490
So finally,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.120
we need the El bur so that we can take it out on the grocer.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.580
So I'm just going toe all put that value also.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:58.150
So I'm going to make it into a few other so that we can just click on it from confirmation

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:06.790
and be docked nor balancer de in its name.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.470
Sugar is the name I was looking for.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:14.000
So I just add a description also to see what it iss So your own good here,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.910
so we can go ahead.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.350
And since it's a self stack on,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.050
check it out.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.750
Okay,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:24.780
so my stack is all good so that I can go ahead on deploy it and it should ask my

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.610
confirmation because we're building multiple security groups and multiple stacks out there

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.610
.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.800
You can do one by one and just going to say deployment of source stack because this is

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.940
dependent on this BBC stack automatically in my city cable deploy the different stack

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.340
aspirin.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.860
So I'm just going to chose this one on later.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.750
Sometime it is going to ask me a question with it and we want to deploy the Elvis type.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.050
Also just going toe preempted by saying why?

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.740
So let us go toe are abused,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.700
export and see what the resources are getting.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.820
But so I should see one start getting,

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.150
but that is my BBC stack.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.800
First on,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:02.970
then,

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.580
after this,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.410
it will be following and deploying my auto scaling group on everything.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.840
So just quickly take you through all the services that we were going to see later.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.190
This is my,

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:18.340
uh you see two page in Virginia that are no servers right now running on defy take you to

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.280
my auto scaling group.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:19.520
There.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.460
Nothing there.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:28.280
Unlike wise that there is no lunch confrontation Also on no Lord balances no diving groups

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:28.280
,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.080
so they just wait for our stack to get completed.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.600
Let me just wait for my humans.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.940
And here so you can see him on BBC stock is completely just go back to our stacks.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.400
Andi,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.840
I should see one more stack here.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.990
If I go back here,

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.050
you can see the other stack has started building.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:54.790
So let's go and check out our Evans to see what humans are getting pulled and resources.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:14:03.220
I can see the security group that has been created already on board balances getting

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.550
created.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.490
Let us start taking over things killed.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.650
So bl we're seeing a load balance and so they just go ahead and check it out.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.470
So,

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.350
other listeners,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.030
my listeners,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:20.370
are still getting burned and you can see you.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.500
There's a BBC on.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.050
This is my public subjects.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.440
If you go to your maybe see section,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.730
you can confirm that this is part off the public subjects so city is automatic and picking

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.430
up my public submits act.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.750
Applying my lord balance of in the public submits.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:41.450
So we should be able to see this many other or so populist into the protection on also the

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.350
concert when it there's that companies deployment.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:50.450
So let us go back to proper formation and seeing what other resources are completed here.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.940
So we should see some more resources that is getting started just goto over events again so

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.110
we can see there is a launch configuration.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:03.330
So I think this is my auto scaling group so we can see here.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.900
That's a launch template as well.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.950
So just take it over here.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:13.930
So here's my lunch conversation that he do Micro instance that he said,

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:18.850
and we didn't want that and keep name that is my were were able to connect it with the

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:24.160
fishing's manager because we have instant Superfly with the This is,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.320
um,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.250
agent rule.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.720
Likewise,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.190
we have a lunch configuration with daughters Killing group,

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.850
so we have this minimum capacity and a maximum capacity.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.200
So if everything is good,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.740
we should be able to see two instance coming up here.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:44.540
So as soon as our instances are coming up online on available in the target groups,

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:50.390
we should be able to see them here so you can see that's interrogators available on the

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.260
target tradition is in progress.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.330
So once it is successful,

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.450
we should be able to see something like healthy or okay here.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:03.710
So I'm going to check my tour formation on Dhere.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:12.820
We have that you are in so you can see here my web app is running on.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.040
You can see the I P address off this hour or so.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.050
It is a 10 10 to 95.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.570
If I go ahead and refresh my screen,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.500
I should see the I P address also changing.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.910
That means that I have to Web servers behind my application.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.930
Lord balances on the traffic is distributed to the different sellers depending upon the

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.250
load on the each server.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:36.930
That is how you create and lips over in an auto scaling group on friend ended with an

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.200
application character.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.910
Go ahead and write in your account.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.000
If you have any problems,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.340
put them in the comments section.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.900
I'll be happy to help them with you.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.770
Thanks for watching Happy learning.
