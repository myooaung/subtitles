00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
Hello Falls.

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.890
Welcome back to another lecture on silly Gay.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.380
This time we're going to see how the great in essence,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.670
stopping on,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.950
go ahead and added the military's as a subscription on pushing myself into the topic and

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.300
see whether we are receiving that email in our mailbox.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.750
So let's go ahead and see how we can builders into over Siddique a stack.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.970
So this is a stack that we're going to build.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.650
I created a fine coldest custom.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.470
SNL starts B Y on the class is going to be customs s and a stack on.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.070
Remember,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.300
Since we're going to use a new conflict,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.490
we need to go ahead and add it to the requirements.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.940
Fine.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.320
So they still that first.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.090
So this is simply a sadness.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.150
So now we have added the SNS topic for subscriptions that it's another construct that our

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.250
city Kate offers.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.170
So let the school where and add that on it is called us.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.060
Aws underscore s Ennis underscore.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.130
We have something called subscriptions.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.170
Go ahead and install the dependencies as soon as you add them so that you don't forget that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.170
,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.650
Peter.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.890
So now we have installing dependencies.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.260
Let us go back toe are stacks file and then go ahead and update our staff.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.480
Close this.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.320
Okay?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310
Four thing is we're going to create a topic and before creating it,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.660
really to importers constructs into our stack itself.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.120
So let's start with that.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.970
Every city can't import aws underscored sns as underscore poisonous on.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.070
But we also need to import a subscription also so that we can use it later.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.350
I'm just going to duplicate this so that we can just go ahead and meditate easily.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.840
Just so we're all set for going out and getting a first stop in the first topic is going to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.580
be called This constant topic on it is going to use the s and this construct on until it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.940
constantly have a method called this topic on.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.600
As always,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.250
we will scope it,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.960
toe this stack on.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.130
Well,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.560
great.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.060
Create an I D on decided is going to be const owned hot topics on.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.800
We can provide a display name for our topic on this display name is going to be something

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.920
like any custom string that you want to show that you can identify this topic and all the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.750
topics that you might have in an account.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.970
So that is a display name.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.380
And then you can have a topic name that you can use it into your stacks or other

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.170
applications on this is going to be con stone hot topic.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.100
So we're on set.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.580
This is always required to create,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.040
in essence,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.350
topic on we want to create in subscription.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.990
So for creating a subscription on you have to do is constant topic about act subscription

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.440
on.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.650
Then,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.840
for adding a subscription.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.080
We have another method like subs that we have already important on the subsidy Have many

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.550
options,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.560
which is email subscriptions Are you have adjacent subscriptions?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.040
Different battle subscriptions are there.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.090
This time we're going to use that email subscription option on inside this.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.690
We can do any emails you want.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.930
I'm just going to give me one here on later that go ahead.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.550
And I had a valid one at that portion message.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.950
So they just go ahead and synthesize or stack to see everything is good.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.320
And if it is good,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.150
I'm going to go ahead and deploy it.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.770
So my stackers completely just goto our court formation section here So you can see here.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.690
This is still saying created program segment.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.650
Refresh it on Dhere.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.120
I should seek to resources oneness for this in this topic and forth subscription.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.490
So let me go toe in this topic Service on here.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.750
We have one topic.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.710
Andi,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.330
this is a constant topic here on you can see here there's a pending subscription for this

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.520
one.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.990
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add another subscription and then let us go ahead

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.250
and try and publish another sits there.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.620
Now I have added and subscription toe this topic on have already subscribed to it.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.650
So that should be received a message from Just go over and quickly send a text message.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.610
So let me just go ahead and pick this one quickly.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.190
Here,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.150
then just send it because we're just doing a demo,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.120
that it's not necessary.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.440
But you can see here that this message to be sent from or essence stop It has been

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.850
successfully received in our basic books.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.600
That is how you create in essence topic with city haystack and greatest subscription on.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.890
Go ahead and use that in your applications.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.700
Cry it.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.700
If there are problems for them in the comments,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.970
we can learn from each other.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.630
Thanks for watching Happy learning
