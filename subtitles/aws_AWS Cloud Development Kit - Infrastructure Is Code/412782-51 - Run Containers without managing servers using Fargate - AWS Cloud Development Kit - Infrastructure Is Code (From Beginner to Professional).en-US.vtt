00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hello,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.920
folks.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.200
Welcome to another lecture on CD K.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.020
The active feel Better that we're going to see now.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.560
Here's how to run applications,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.310
which are containerized without running any soldiers.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.280
When you're talking about containers that are many ways off running them in AWS easy.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.260
This is one off them.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.560
He cases one off them,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.130
whether it is on PC to or managed question.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.740
But the other way of running attendances without the PC to problem that you need to manage

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.300
with instances auto scaling,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.790
patching on configuration,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.320
that is where firing it comes into picture where you just prohibition when your containing

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.030
information.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.670
For example,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.010
What is the container image?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.100
What is the memory?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.330
What is the longing?

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.940
And you don't worry about the underlying compute at all?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.900
That is what fire get off words for you so you can run application containers without

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.310
worrying about the underlying servers.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.130
So that is what we're calling a seller less containers.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.850
So the demo that we're going to build is going to look something like this we're going to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.740
create on plaster and far get on.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.180
Once we created Lester,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.350
we're going to create and service,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.560
which is going to run our application Web servers on inside this Web service.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.960
We're going to create a container definition,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.200
which is part off the task definition.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.760
On what?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.930
Inside the staff definition,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.980
we're going to run a very,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.290
very simple Web service,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.260
which is going to have a static page on this task.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.740
Is going to be friend tended or connected to a load balancer.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.850
I'm for when you're talking about not balancer.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.850
We need target groups so that we can isolate the Web service separately.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.220
Applications ever separately on any other logging o r payments separately.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.790
So you have different target groups,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.120
so we create that I attracted toe on good balance.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.060
So this is a very simple architecture on what I'm going to show you or to us.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.740
One more thing.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.920
Say,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.600
for example,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.450
that Lord is increasing on your containers.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.970
How do you go ahead and increase it?

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.130
Say,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.830
for example,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.980
and the peak traffic when you have more Lord,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.970
what you do is you go ahead and increase the number off or desire attached that you want to

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.830
run earlier.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.760
If you were running one now we're going to run to tasks so that you're service can't manage

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.890
the traditional lord.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.940
And still you can sell all that request.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.560
It is coming into your containers.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.900
So this is what we're going to pull.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.360
Now let's go to our city,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.900
Kester,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.750
and see how we can build this.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.320
This is the fact that we're going to use.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.080
I have named it as summer less container architecture with fire gets stack.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.600
Right now,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.470
there are no resources that has been built on likewise are nor imports.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.100
Also,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.750
we are going to do everything from scratch on for any container or any computer environment

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.120
that you want to run an interview Issue needed.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.840
BPC So that is the first service that we're going to put now on.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.750
BBC is part off the A C to model,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.070
so let us go ahead and import it.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.580
So let this go head on,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.860
but it over bpc on school Bit on,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.490
I'm going to say I want my vpc to be script spread across two availability zones on for not

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.060
a gateways.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.890
I'm going to say I want one Lee one at to get with.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.810
So our BBC years of built So next is going to build our fire,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.650
get plaster.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.580
So let's go ahead and do that on this is coming as part off the easiest model on right now

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.580
.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.520
We have not imported the easiest morning.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.310
So let me go ahead and import it on.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.680
Make sure that you have installed your easiest model here.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.220
If if we're just not there,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220
go ahead and do that.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.090
In my case,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.230
I have already had the easiest model and PCs patterns More do both of these things that we

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.430
will be using shortly.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.010
So forces easiest.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.850
So it just go ahead and build our cluster.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.750
So we have created the scope on the I.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.500
D on.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.640
We're going to define our BBC so that PCs knows Gladys Crestor is going to recite.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.860
So we got our vpc also added,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.450
let us go ahead on create our container rights to service.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.660
So here I'm going to call this as so we're less web service on under easiest patterns.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.910
We have something called us.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.260
If yes,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.780
patterns,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.870
we have not imported it.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.040
Let me just go ahead and do that once again.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.470
If you have not installed it,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.650
go ahead and install it.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.450
Otherwise you'll be getting an other.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.060
So under this,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:37.070
we how something called as application load balanced fargate service on it is sculpt this

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.290
on been Call this as Web service.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.390
I'm goingto say that this service is going to be launched.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.410
So under cluster,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.790
I'm going to say by car service,

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.250
cluster on for memory.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:56.140
This time I'm going to say 1024 on the far get passed on combination off memory and CPU.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.590
You need to maintain those combinations.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.120
Otherwise you'll be getting an error.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.330
The Amazon Documentation page clearly defines what is the combinations that you can have on

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.250
what is supported.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.450
So the combination that I'm using here is one of the least configurations.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.450
Body definitely is supported on countries to run the container that we are going to run.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.710
So finally we got our CPU.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.940
Also added then is what kind of image I want to run in my task.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.470
So we have wanted to find that so under easy s dot container image from registry.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.030
Once again,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.960
I'm going to use it from Dr Hub if you have an easy A registry and if you already have an

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.430
image,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.290
go ahead and use that as well.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.540
So mr slash Web.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.920
So it is going to be serving in a very simple web application running on engine X.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.330
So that is all we need to do on in case if you want to pass some environment variable to

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.110
your container,

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.400
you can use the environment really well for that.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.060
For example,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.160
if you're connecting to a database than you need to kill the database user name and

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.710
password,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.150
are you not the password?

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.870
Probably the date of this.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.850
You are.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.830
You want to pass it on?

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.200
Then you can use this for passwords.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.550
You probably use an interview secret or parameters toward forced storing it securely.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.760
So in this case,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.330
I'm just going to give you an example of how you can say that environment for your

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.650
container or the creation date or anything like that.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.510
So we got our So is definition also set up?

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.230
Let us set up some health checks so that our applications over can check when,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.980
uh so this is coming online on.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.170
Hope confirmed that the service is healthy or not,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.450
are starting new Basque,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.480
so we are going to say summer less Web service.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.730
Dark Target group not going figure has check.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.910
Under this.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.410
We're going to say that I think will toe slash.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.880
So if you have a different website with the multiple parts or different that yours that you

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.020
want to take you and go here that had a different health checks for that.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.880
So that is all it is their I'm going toe put the load balancer urine so that we can quickly

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.650
go head on and take it out.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:30.200
So that is on there.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.810
We have done on the type things by 50 lines.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.250
Of course,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.780
we have got our Forget Leicester.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.050
Let us go and center facial stack and see if everything is good.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.610
So let's go ahead and deployed now our stack What completed?

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.320
Let us go ahead and take what resources have been built on.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.050
We'll put it to the test to see whether just working fine as expected.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.140
So this is our stack.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.260
I'm in Virginia region on.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.200
Let us go ahead and take on the resources.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.660
We should have a BBC.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.220
We should have an easiest cluster on also,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.880
and service and the task to find.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.900
So this is our cluster here on.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.570
We also have a BPC that is to go ahead on chek our cluster.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.110
And remember,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.440
this is in silver lists that cluster groups.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.490
So there is no easy to or anything Croatian.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.460
You can see here under Fugate,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.000
we have and service on under that service,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.520
we have one running task on.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.020
If I could do my Basques here,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.240
so that is the service.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.980
On the first day.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.620
We have a task definition on all the information that people vision.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.250
So if you go to your loves,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.810
you can see the logs from your health checks that are happening here on.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.560
You can see there are different log information that are available for you to troubleshoot

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.450
if that is an issue or anything like that.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.560
So let us go ahead on access.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.840
This cell is from the north balance that you weren't.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.510
You can pick it up from the sea to load balancer Page are can go to your outputs on and

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.700
find that you are here.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.820
Let me just pick it up here so you can see here.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.460
The simple web application is working,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:00.990
flying,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.500
So actually said earlier,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.870
What we're going to do now is we're going to see how to increase the capacity off your

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.800
forget plaster.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.350
So we are running one task.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.650
What I'm going to do is I'm going to say I want a minimum off two tasks that are running.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.830
So if I go back here on the details section off your cluster,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.560
let's go back here on the services.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.710
You have only one task so we want to run to task.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.250
So that's what we're going to go ahead and take it out now.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.330
So on we have to do is under the definition that you have made here.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.130
So I'm going to say desired come equal to to save this file on.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.670
I'm going to deploy it are before deploying.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.150
Let me just show you the proof.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.860
It will clearly show you that earlier the Valley Waas one which was the default setting.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.570
Now it is going to identify the differences to London.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.350
It is going to make the changes.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.680
So a stack what completed?

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.700
Just go ahead and take.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.500
We have two tasks running impressed the page here so we can see the other two dusk running

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.500
.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.310
But when you access the you are you will not notice the difference because the it is

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.290
attached to the load balancer on that request will be coming from either one of those

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.150
containers.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.650
Andi,

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:15.650
to confirm that if you goto our load balancers section and they're easy to you have not

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.150
been insolent target groups.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.850
So let's just go to our target groups on.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:26.220
We should be seeing a different I P addresses being registered here for targets you can see

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.140
here earlier.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.060
It must have been one on now that another task has been added on the fastest.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.390
Smart enough to understand this,

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.210
and is that automatically be?

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.310
How want asking one availability zone on the new task is getting added on the new Oliver It

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.700
is Oh,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.150
so you are achieving high availability.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:49.470
One common usage pattern or best practice for using far get clusters is mentioning you are

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.220
matrices for your application.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.860
For example,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.840
it might mean a load balancer late insee or your CPU PlayStation for your fire,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.290
get task based on those mattresses.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.430
What you can do is you can increase or decrease the or fire,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.750
get capacity by adding more tests are removing us from your plaster.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.700
This way,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.320
you will have always the enough amount of resources on you're not paying for unused

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.420
capacity are overcapacity on.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.360
You can configure Lambda function for that on that way it is also,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.490
unless I'm completely at my automatically managed for you to summarize,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:30.490
we have created and far get Leicester on with that pastor be created and service on inside

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:36.180
the service we added and task on we at ask those tasked to our application load balancer

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.690
target groups and we also have an application load balancer pointing to the stock groups.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.160
Go ahead and try different combinations with the different the container images are

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.600
different.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.700
Sizes are even adding more.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.820
Does still removing task dynamically and see how it is impacting your application as always

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:53.820
.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.680
Thanks for watching happy learning.
