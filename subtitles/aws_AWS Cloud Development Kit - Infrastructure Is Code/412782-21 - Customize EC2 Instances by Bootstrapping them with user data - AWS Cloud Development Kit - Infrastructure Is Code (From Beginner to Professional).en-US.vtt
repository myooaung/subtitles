00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hello,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.880
folks.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.550
Welcome to another every short on CTK.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.500
This time we're going to see how the launch and easy to instance with some footsteps

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.130
scripts,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.550
especially using that you should later field.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.160
If you're going to launch a Web server,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.180
it is not uncommon to pick up the latest question off your tips over vanities from the

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.560
Internet or from your local reported tree.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.590
Or you might want to copy some files so that the Web server will have a nice looking

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.270
webpage when the terrace and you exchange.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.570
So in those cases,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240
you said that if you becomes really,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.240
really interesting,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.870
useful,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.250
So let's see how we can do this in our own account.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.450
This is the repository that we were using so far for running over syndicate demos.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.400
I've just taken the best of easy to stack on right now,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.340
my Web servers not running.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.050
So what we're going to do is we're going to add some usually the field.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.680
So this Web server on open some security groups so that it can accept traffic on the for 80

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.950
or 4 40 if you are going to configure it for certificates also,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.800
so first is we need that usually discriminative.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.940
So I would recommend you to put it in the root off your project or if you are putting in

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.430
some other,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.870
Ford wrote.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.700
It's not a problem.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.450
You just need to reference it properly.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.750
So I'm going to call my usual eaters location as a bootstrap scripts.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140
So under this,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.280
I'm going to create a file called as Install History.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.050
Typically,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.270
Andi,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.340
I'm going to write this in Bash,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.260
so I'm going to install basically,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.220
City pretty here.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.760
I'm not going to get a lamp stack with PHP and everything.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.610
If you're interested,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.050
go ahead and add all the necessary packages that you are interested in on.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.600
I'm going to configure it so that whenever the server restarts on my package comes online,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.930
that is.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.590
My service comes on length th config Mr Deeply on Andre.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350
Just finally start the service as well.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.560
So that's it.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.470
My pushups script is really so The next step is importing it into my cellar,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.310
so I'm just going to add some comments.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.340
It is always a good practice to comment you your court so that you can understand it when

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.270
you come back later.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.110
So we're going to read from the file now.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.650
So this is basic fighting here.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.350
We're just going to pick up the location.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.150
Bootstrap.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:30.370
Followed by the finding on.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.800
We're not way to modify it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.530
Just I'm just going to open it as a read,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.200
only more.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.560
I'm going to store it in a very We called this usually that you could have any variable

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.270
here but should not be a problem.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.920
So we have read the contents of the file on it is in persuading accuser later.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.280
So we're just going to import it now?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.580
Yeah.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.410
I'm going to say user data equal to score.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.550
Easy to dart,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.450
Dr Custom.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.090
So that's it.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.470
My user data field has been imported here so far?

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.880
No.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.280
We need a Web server i p address so that we can go ahead and quickly find out what is the i

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.500
p address and put it in approaching.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.050
So I'm going to you losers and output field so that we can pick up the idea Trust easily.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.890
Since we have seen it already,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.150
I'm just going to quickly update this information.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:36.180
So here is the interesting point here.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.350
So we're launching Web server so you can easily access the public eye.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.190
Beatrice Webb,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.150
seller dot instance underscore public.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.710
I see so you can do it this way are if you are going to put it in the process.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.630
We can also have some fancy additions by string manipulation here.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.140
So what we can do is we can just say at the CTP part that's what's so that we can quickly

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.950
click on it.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.360
So that's it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.650
So remember,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.790
as I said earlier this hour,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.530
does not accept any traffic right now because the security group,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.270
by default,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.750
does not allow incoming traffic.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.350
So we're going to add and so are Soviet window alot,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.350
incoming traffic.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:38.040
So the easiest way to do it is so where Dr Connections on we're going toe all alone all I'd

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.170
be before traffic from all over the Internet.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:55.130
So the sister is alot from any I'd be before on we're going to do it for Port 80 and I'm

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.950
just going to add a friendly description here so that we know why we're open this port.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.990
So let me go ahead and quit.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.350
You check.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.810
Everything is fine before we go in and synthesize so with open bootstrap steps.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.820
So that seems to be anti poll here,

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.950
let me just fix that.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.870
That is bootstrap scripts installing CPD file.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.970
And then we have imported that usually feel and then get out,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.740
putting the public I p address on.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.200
Then we're following the traffic on Port 80.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.580
So everything seems to be fine.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.250
So that this go ahead and synthesize it.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.410
So it looks everything is fine here,

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.960
so they just go ahead and deployed as well.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.080
Since we're opening of the Internet traffic,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.650
it is asking for my permission so that the school had said yes.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.570
So let's head over to our information service here.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.690
We should start seeing and use that coming up here on a given section.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.650
It should start building my lips over.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.120
So that's off.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.290
No,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.120
we have an instance.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.470
Profile level changing.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.350
Go to your resources.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.120
He would see all the resources that I mean,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.550
but but off the stack.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.750
So we guard our security group,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.550
so let us go ahead and check whether we have Port 80 open on our security group.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.260
So on the in bone room,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.650
you can see that support 80 on that description that we get here.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.830
In my opinion,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.580
it's always a perspectives to have some prescriptions.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.340
So you know why there particleboard was open or but it'll rule was added in your security

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.890
group for Let me refresh it.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.650
Here seem whether stack is completed,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.420
we can see here Stack is completed.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.230
Let me go to my output section.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.650
We have our I p address.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.870
So that means Uganda's If everything is fine,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.230
we should have a taste face here.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.850
So that is how simple it is to use that you sell it a field to launch and server on also

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.350
having bootstrapped with some packages or any other packages.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.190
So go ahead and try this in your own account.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.040
If you have any problems for them in the comments in the next demonstration,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.050
we will see how to pick up some fights from s three or makes them for the customer.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.150
Stations in bunching are easy to instance from city care.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.140
Thanks for watching Happy learning
