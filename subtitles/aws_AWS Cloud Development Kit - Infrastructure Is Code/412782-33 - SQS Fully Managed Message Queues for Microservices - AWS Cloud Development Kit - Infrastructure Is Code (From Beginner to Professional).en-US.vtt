00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.310
Hello,

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.880
folks.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.080
Welcome to another episode on City Que.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.290
This time we're going to see how to create a fully managed my city.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.170
Que that can be used with your micro services are several a socket pictures so that you can

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.150
connect your applications through these cues.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
So let's go ahead and build them and see game now.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.270
So this is the fact that we're going to use Andi.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060
I have created a new fine.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.860
So this stock is going to be called as custom excuse stack on.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.540
As always,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.400
since we're going to use a new construct,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.310
we need toe,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.860
install it and then import it So they just go to our requirements while on go ahead and at

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.250
that.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.070
Now let's go ahead and install it.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.400
The installation is completed.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.950
Let me go ahead and start building the stack.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.750
So first step is always import New construct that we have just installed on it is called

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.200
that elevators sq us on.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000
I am going to import.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.830
It has underscore sqs.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.860
I'm going to call this as constant you on the excuse we have on methodical this cube on

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.960
under there will scope it for our stack on then we'll call this as constant que on here,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.410
the important attributes off the queue.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.280
The first thing is,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
I'm going to add It's a Q name on.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.340
I'm just going to call this as gone.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.840
Stone underscored.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.960
Que onda?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.360
I'm going to create on fight folk.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.860
You what 54 q Means is first and forced out.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.350
The messages that come in first will also be eat.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.590
It seemed our first,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.280
so that is what a 54 q means.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.940
So for any five folk,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.750
you you need to up in the name are followed by 50.5 for Ed,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450
so that is mandatory.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.660
And we also need to set up the fight for bullion value or sort of true,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.620
this means that we're setting up off,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.140
I thought you on whether do we want to encrypt messages that are going to be stored in our

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.330
Q?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.590
Yes,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.390
and better say I want my message.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.570
Is that under excuse?

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.700
You have something called a secure encryption on the two encryption.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.570
We have a multiple of values,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.120
and I'm going to say you think a mismanaged case into my data on how long you do we want

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.890
that met face to be the attended the Cube.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.080
We have something before that called us the detention period and I'm going to say corridor

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.870
duration.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.220
Dark days on.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.940
I'm going to say about four days.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.270
I want the message is to be detained in my queue.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.160
Finally,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.400
if I have a processor,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.060
are my other end of the queue on how long do I want the facility Time or basically this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.580
mentions.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.970
If that's a downstream process that just taking up the message from the kill,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.660
How long should it be?

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.450
Not visible to the other processors so that we know that every message is processed.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.200
So by default,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.010
the time is something like 30 seconds.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.880
We can go ahead and increase it or decrease it by using this parameter here.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.070
So just go ahead and say 45 seconds.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.560
So that is it our cues done.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.670
I'm going to go ahead on and sent the faceoff stack on.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.640
If everything is good,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.650
I just go ahead and apply them.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.400
Now the status deplored letters Go door court formation service and check it out.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.190
We have the custom Excuse stack onder outputs that I have nothing because we have not

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.470
exported anything on If I go to my resources,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.490
we have this sqs June that has been created.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.480
Let us go ahead and pick it up from services here.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.510
You can see here that is in a contra and fight for Q on all the parameters that we have

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.790
added,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.310
For example,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.310
the message attention period on the default time out on also the encryption.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.870
If I go to my encryption section,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.870
you can see the encryption is also picked up.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.420
So I think there is no que If you're really on our family with the cues,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.130
it's very simple to go ahead and test it out.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:51.230
You can just go ahead and say this message so message for Let us say constant que on.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.160
You need to add a unique message any so I'm just going to say Kato us on just going to add

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.830
the same mighty and send message.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.520
And usually what happens is once you send a message,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.900
it takes about a minute for the message to start appearing here.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.580
So now you see it as zero.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.520
In a short while,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.790
this number will change.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.820
If not,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.910
go ahead in the precious cream to take it out.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.810
You can see here.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.690
The messages appeared here.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.150
So we have sent a message on the messages being received in the queue on this message will

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.750
be there for four days.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.330
Unless there is a process that that is coming up and picking up this message and deletes it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.330
.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.660
That is how you set up.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.170
Uh,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.180
excuse que on push messages into your rescue rescue using City Cape.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.310
Go ahead and try it.
