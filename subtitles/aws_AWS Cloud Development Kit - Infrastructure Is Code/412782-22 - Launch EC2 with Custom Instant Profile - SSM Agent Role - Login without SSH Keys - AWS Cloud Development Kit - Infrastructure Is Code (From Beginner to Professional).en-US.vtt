00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hello,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.840
folks.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.030
Welcome to another episode on City.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.780
This time we're going to see how the large and easy to instance.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.930
But some people in privileges,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.680
for example,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.570
if you have an easy two instance,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.030
you will need to have some privileges so that you can access s three buckets.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.690
Or you might even use cold Watch agent so that it can communicate with gold watch and push

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.450
some logs.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.130
Or you might need an SS,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.970
um agent so that you can automate this over and fulsome batches on automatically update

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.250
that.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.160
So for all these things you need and I am pro flying,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.860
that is going to be a dad to your easy to instance,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.960
which is called less an instance profile At that distance,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.410
profile will need some privileges like,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.960
for example,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.430
it's awesome.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.720
Permissions are as three permissions or some other provisions.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.450
So let's go ahead and see how we can do this in our account.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.760
So this is the Web server stack that we used earlier way have a BBC and up off that we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.190
built in a simple and easy to instance on,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.070
by default a city cables you and I am profile without any privileges.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.740
So I'm going to show you how you can add some managed policies.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.030
You can go ahead and use the same concepts reviews.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.160
Your own policies are permissions.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.880
This time I'm going to start with some AWS managed policies and peacefully passed them to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.120
your easy to instance.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920
Since we're dealing with policies,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.010
the four step is importing that I am.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.520
So let us go ahead and do that.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.830
A rumor really took install it as well.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.650
So once I have done with the import here,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.250
I will go ahead and install the package.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.040
So it is called US evolution to school.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.960
I am so water requirements.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.230
And at that package,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.010
before I forget it,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.950
I'm going to trigger the insulation here.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.090
Oh,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.220
so we're finished with the installation letters.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.070
Go back to our stack on day,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.250
start adding the permissions so that this Axum coming so we know what we're adding there.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.800
So we are going to reference the Web server road so under website where you have the better

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.340
Caldas Web,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.180
several road on,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.530
we're going to go had managed policy on inside manage policy.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.130
Be needle at the interviews managed I am Aaron or the role name.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.150
So the way to provide that is I am has matured for that.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.340
It is called us managed policy from man.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.810
Its for a C name on the 1st 1 is the one I want to add is an SS,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.180
um,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.880
agent rule because we're using in his own likeness.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.930
Stoicism agent is pre built in.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.690
So by adding this privileges,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.960
this is,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.120
um,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.470
agent will be able to talk to this awesome service,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.310
and you can do some automation like update management.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.960
O R.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.230
10 7 combined said Don't pick up some long flights or push them lock friends.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.590
So different things that you can do with this road.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.980
I want to add one more old so that I can pick up some fights from s three orders of this

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.470
going to took.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.470
The gators are goingto adhere as Amazon.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.280
Yes,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.240
you read only access we don't want off.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.310
Permissions are particular pocket permissions right now.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.710
In production was probably what you'll do is invite the custom policy where you give this

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.390
instance access to particular extreme pocket.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.630
You didn't want to give it to boil the estate,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.530
but catching your account.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.160
So we had done here.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.480
Let us.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.900
Go ahead and synthesizers stack and see if everything looks good.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.060
So everything looks good here.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.690
Let us go ahead and deploy.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.990
So,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.780
one second we're deploying a simple Web servers that we should be able to check the Web

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.540
server by using the I P address off the server.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.290
Onda.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.410
We will also try to connect to the seller because we have an excess of agent on.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.930
We will try to run some commanders to check whether we can access the yesterday but gets or

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.450
not.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.810
So let's get over a low information service now so we can see here.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.910
There's a stack that this getting built Let us go to events onder.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.740
Easy to instance,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.250
right now,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.260
I don't have any running instances.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.540
Once my stack completes,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.400
we should have on running instance here,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.750
so I'm just going to wait for the start to complete.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.430
So let's go ahead and see what resources have been created.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.220
We can see here,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.710
for instance,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.700
is getting put on the system instance role that will be attached at this school head and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.430
check what permissions have been added.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.970
We added to permissions one for SS until SS um managed instant score on.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.770
We also added the Amazon estimated only access so we can see both the paralysis up in added

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.280
here.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.040
Likewise,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.580
we should also have an easy two instance running.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.100
We can see here that is up and running now.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.140
So let us take the Cypriot er's and put it in a brochure and check whether our web server

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.050
is ableto be access from the Internet.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.310
So you can see here our web servers running on were able to access it.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.010
So this is not it we actually I managed to add some privileges,

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.200
so let's go ahead and check.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.010
Our SSN agent is on length.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.230
So if our system agent is online and is communicating to the service,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.980
we should be able to connect with us over on the run.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.950
Some commands there,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.130
So we should be thrown into and bash or a deep portion from here.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.670
You've been going to bash as well.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.770
So little on has three less comment because we have privileges to check s three.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.840
If we go to our s three servers,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.650
we will be able to see the same flight.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.090
But cats that are in my account so you can see here we're getting the same five buckets and

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.890
you can go ahead on Brett some data from the buckets or push some data to the packets are

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.180
you could use the same hated privileges to push them a lot.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.590
Medics to the cloud watches There was also.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.470
So this is how you launch an easy two instance with instance provide with the customized of

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.230
privileges instead of managed policies.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.350
You can go ahead and write your own policies and also at them aside,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.090
shown here trying with the manage policies.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.440
Then,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.420
once you're familiar with their,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.950
then go ahead and start casting my secret and tightening the policies that would be

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.990
required in the production.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.440
Sit down.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.610
Go ahead and try it.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.510
How fun with it.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.500
If you have any problems for de medicaments,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.770
I will try and help them to.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.600
Until then,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.220
thanks for watching Happy learning
