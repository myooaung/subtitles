Welcome back everyone and this lecture will learn how to do additional fields.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,080
Currently we can only see one field of our models in the list view on the Admin Page.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,120
We can actually add more fields to view AND ORDER BY.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,700
And again this is also just an easy addition of an attribute in that class.

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,670
We've been kind of playing around with the up overs of the editor unsure how to do it.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,190
All right so here we are back at the admin PI file and before we actually added the attribute I want

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,300
to show you what it currently looks like when we look at the list view of a particular model and to

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,880
bring in over my browser and right now if I don't do any filters or if I show all I can see all the

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,520
movies.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,590
So I only see right now movie in this list view of a model.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,300
So bringing that over again.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,880
Let's go ahead and show you the attributes and the attributes quite simple as just list display lists

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,020
underscore display and let's go ahead and just copy this list so we display all the fields.

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,540
Usually you probably don't want to do this depending on how many fields you have in your model but that

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,800
should be enough for us.

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,030
We'll save it and then let's bring back our list view page and then I'm going to refresh this and I

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,360
can see the really cear the length and the title and the order you put them in the list is the order

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,210
they show up.

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,470
So I probably want a title over here on the left hand side.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,770
Let's do that as well and move this over and let's go ahead and have title be first.

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,510
So don't cut that here.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,720
It's actually his insert title and then remove it over here on the back.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,230
There you go.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,080
So I'm going to save this and now refresh the page.

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,450
And I can see.

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,230
Title is now here first.

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,300
So whatever is first in this column is the one you can click on to go to the detail view page.

28
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,180
So again this is the list view.

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,040
Click on one of these.

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,700
It shows you the detailed view.

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,830
You can also now sort by these guys so you can notice these little kind of pop ups here so you can sort

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,200
by really sure just by clicking here on the top column and that's how you can add more fields in your

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,740
list for you.

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,690
Simple as that.

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,230
Again the attribute is just lists underscore display and hopefully now you get the theme of how easy

36
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,050
it is to work with Django admen.

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,450
You essentially just create a class here.

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,960
Inherit from Adam in that model admin and then add in attributes as you need them.

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,840
Things like filtering displaying search fields etc. and then just remember to register that particular

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,930
class.

41
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,140
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
