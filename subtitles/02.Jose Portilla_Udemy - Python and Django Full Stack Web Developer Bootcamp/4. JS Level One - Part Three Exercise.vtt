Hello everyone and welcome to part three.

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.530
Your first javascript exercise.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.250
Let's get some practice of your new skills.

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.530
You're going to be creating a very simple web site that takes an A waits in imperial pounds and converts

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.320
it to kilogrammes the H-2A mail is already done.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.120
All your work will just be in the connected not just file and the files can be found under javascript.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.350
Level one folder and they're called Part 3 underscore exercise that each team L and part 3.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.810
J.S..

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.330
So at the bottom of the html file is the connection to the solution that js file which is part 3 that

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.080
js.

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.560
Make sure to actually change that to your own.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.630
Yes file before you start.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.040
Let's quickly explore the HTML file and what the sexercise actually looks like.

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.790
Going to hop over to the editor in browser now OK here you have my editor open as well as the browser

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.090
connected to the H Tim L file and the instructions for the exercise are actually already embedded into

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
this aist him file like image and you're going to be creating a weight metric converter taken a number

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.650
in pounds and convert it to kilograms.

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.570
And what you're going to be doing is.

19
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.350
First you need to grab the Tamil file in all the way down at the bottom we have the script and the reason

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.840
the script is at the bottom is because I want him to load before my script actually loads.

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.110
So I have the script here and right now it's connected to my own script my script that G-S.

22
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.560
But when you first open this file it's going to be connected to part 3.

23
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.270
Yes that is the solution.

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.510
Javascript file.

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.450
So if you want you can run this.

26
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.790
H TIM PAGE ONE time so you can see what the solution looks like.

27
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.340
As far as its interaction with the Web site but make sure when you're actually programming your javascript

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.900
you remember to change the source to your own solution.

29
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.940
Ok so like I said you first want to actually change the script here so it links to your work.

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.670
Then use javascript to accept a number and put in pounds.

31
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.490
Then in your JIT javascript file convert this number to kilogrammes and the conversion from pounds to

32
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.900
kilograms is right here.

33
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.920
You multiply it by 0.4 5:4 and then afterwards report back in an alert that the way is now in kilogrammes

34
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.710
and then log slash write conversion completed to the Consul's second Z here conversion complete in the

35
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.550
console.

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.500
Let me refresh the page and show you what this should all look like.

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.940
Once you've come up with your solution a refresh and we see here it says what is the weight in pounds.

38
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.690
So put in one hundred pounds.

39
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.990
Click OK and then report back.

40
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.660
That is forty five point four kilograms.

41
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.290
OK and down here at the con..

42
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.220
I see conversion completed has been logged.

43
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.170
All right.

44
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.790
This is a fairly simple exercise.

45
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.390
It's actually just a few lines of javascript code that gets stuck on anything.

46
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.980
Feel free to post the Kewney forums or just watch the next lecture.

47
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.730
I will code through the solutions.

48
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.620
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
