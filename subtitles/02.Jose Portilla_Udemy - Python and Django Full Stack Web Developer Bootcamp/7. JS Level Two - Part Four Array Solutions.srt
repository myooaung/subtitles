Hello everyone and welcome back to for Array exercise solution and in this lecture we're going to be

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,170
coding through the solution for that student roster Auray exercise project.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,870
Let's head over to the editor and get started.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,130
OK so here with the javascript part for Array exercise file open.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,400
Let's start off by actually creating the functions.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,640
The first thing we need to create was the add new function for adding a new student so call the keyword

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,320
function and we can just get it by typing F-you when hitting enter and we will say add new and add new

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,200
will not take any parameters.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,100
Instead we're going to do is create a variable inside of add new called new name and we will prompt

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,140
the user for what name would you like to add.

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,570
Question mark and then once we get that new name we're going to push it to the roster.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,730
So we'll grab roster push and then push in that new name and that's all there really is for adding the

13
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,820
new student.

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,760
Now is talk about removing the student and this is actually quite a bit trickier and you definitely

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,120
have to visit the stack overflow link if you're going to do it the same way I do it right now and that

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,540
that overfilling basically has the answer of removing a particular element from an array.

17
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:34,920
So again we'll create a function we'll call it remove and I'm going to say a variable we'll call it

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,800
REM name for a move name.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,130
And we'll ask what name would you like to remove.

20
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:52,360
Question mark and then I'm also going to create a variable called index and this is going to be roster

21
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,800
dot and the method here is index of.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:05,670
And that was in the stack overflow link there so roster that index of REM name.

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,820
And then the other thing from the stack overflow was the splice method and the splice method takes an

24
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,390
index comma one

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,590
where one is just how many elements who want to delete.

26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,100
Starting at.

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,440
This index.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,030
And that's all there is for the remove function.

29
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,940
Let's continue on with the next one.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,310
I actually want to do is display rosters.

31
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,940
That was actually quite simple.

32
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,990
It's basically just logging the roster.

33
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:47,540
So we're going to say function display doesn't take any arguments but we will just log the actual roster.

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,510
Now it's time for basically the hard part which is actual all actually programming all that logic and

35
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,960
lines create a couple more lines here just so I can see everything clearly.

36
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,610
We're going to start off by creating two variables called Start and star.

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,870
It's just a prompt.

38
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,370
That says Would you like to start the Ruster web at and will only accept why or.

39
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:24,700
And so will tell the user wire and there and I will also create a variable called request that is equal

40
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,240
to empty and we'll see a request for as in just the second.

41
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:38,850
But basically it's going to be a string and I'm going to say if Star is equal to y meaning the user

42
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,490
did want to start the Web at while

43
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,590
request is not equal

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,290
to quit I'm going to do the following.

45
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,010
I'll ask for a new request by prompting them.

46
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:11,610
Please select an action add or remove display or quit.

47
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,420
And here is where I'm actually going to start testing for stuff all inside this while loop.

48
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,890
So if the request was equal to add.

49
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:31,610
Well in that case I'm going to call add new and add new has the prompt asking for the new name and pushing

50
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,110
it to the roster.

51
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,560
So all I have to do is call add new nothing else.

52
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,930
LCF request

53
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,950
is equal to display.

54
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,340
That's quite easy too.

55
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,030
I just call display

56
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,250
and then LCF

57
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,410
what say request

58
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,070
is equal to remove.

59
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,260
Well in that case I just call the remove function that I created earlier

60
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,950
and if we scroll all the way down we can see the rest of these brackets to make sure they're all balanced.

61
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:27,520
And I'm going to have an alert here that says Thanks for using the web at.

62
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,500
Please refresh to start over.

63
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,940
And as a quick note I don't have an else statement here.

64
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,980
I technically don't really need one for this entire thing to work.

65
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,110
And the reason for that is because they're all in the while loop here.

66
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,310
But something it could do is say.

67
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,440
Else.

68
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,400
And then just have it be quick.

69
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:54,070
So say request is equal to quit.

70
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:01,430
And basically what this does is if request is not add remove the player quit.

71
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,010
So maybe the person typed something wrong.

72
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,680
It will automatically quit.

73
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,560
So we probably also want to say an alert here not recognized

74
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:26,010
we'll quit or we could just say not recognized and then comment this up and then we'll continually ask

75
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,140
for the prompt here.

76
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,740
All right.

77
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,590
So that's really all you have to do.

78
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,710
Let's actually run this and make sure it worked.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,930
We're going to open up my browser.

80
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,310
OK.

81
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,580
Here is my browser.

82
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,620
I've refreshed the page says Would you like start the web app.

83
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,230
I will say yes please select an action.

84
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,110
Let's add something we'll add.

85
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,310
Jose let's display to make sure it works.

86
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,090
There is Jose.

87
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,020
Let's add one more we'll add in Sammy display Jose and Sammy are there.

88
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,390
Let's remove Sammy and Alex display again.

89
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,020
There's Jose.

90
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,280
And then let's try just typing some random and it says not recognize great.

91
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,590
That's exactly what we wanted.

92
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,680
And then we will quit and it says thinks reason the web please refresh to start over.

93
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,780
OK.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,750
So that's it.

95
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,590
Looks like everything works correctly.

96
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,470
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
