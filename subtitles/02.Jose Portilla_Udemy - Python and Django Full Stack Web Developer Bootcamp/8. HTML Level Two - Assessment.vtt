Hello everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.490
We've reached the end of each tim level too.

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.250
So we'll have an assessment for this assessment.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.670
You're just going to be recreating the front end of a basic sign up page for some sort of online course

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.470
web site.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.530
So check out the file HVM at level 2 assessment reached him.

7
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.770
I'll just copy the full file path and put it into your browser.

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.280
Try not to actually look at the HVM L.

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.970
And let's explore before you begin.

10
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.650
Because that's what you're going to be recreating for your assessment.

11
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.850
All right so here we have the file and I assume that the bits we can see it clearly we have a heading

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.110
here.

13
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.340
Course sign a page and then it also says please know first thing last name pass from an email are required

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.930
to you're going to make sure that those fields are have some sort of way of being required when you

15
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.850
click submit.

16
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.630
Review the lectures.

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.920
If you don't remember how to do that.

18
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.630
And notice that this first name last name and email also have some placeholder so I see something here

19
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.810
that says first name and I type and it goes away.

20
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.740
And then we also password make sure that if you type something in the password it's hidden from view

21
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.140
that we say are you over the age of 18 and we have two radio buttons.

22
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.700
Note that as I click yes and no it changes so that means they are linked somehow.

23
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
And then finally we have this do you have a credit card or PayPal.

24
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.040
And we have a dropdown menu that says either choose credit card or PayPal.

25
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.940
Another way you could have interpreted this question is do you have a credit card or PayPal.

26
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.970
Yes or no.

27
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.430
Really.

28
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.060
I just care that you remember how to do a dropdown menu and then click sign up and basically.

29
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.600
Well I need to fill this out.

30
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.010
So let's do that at gmail dot com.

31
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.900
Some password Sign-Up and nothing should happen it just basically refreshes.

32
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.920
In my case the non zoomed in version but you can see appear in the URL that this has changed.

33
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.530
All right.

34
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.820
As a bonus if you feel that this is pretty easy what I want you to do is see if you can select an action

35
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.850
to actually connect this form to some other HVM l page that you've written maybe a thank you page.

36
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.370
So when you click sign up see if you can link it to a thank you page as a bonus for an action.

37
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.030
All right.

38
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.330
Best of luck and I will see you at the next lecture or we actually code through this.
