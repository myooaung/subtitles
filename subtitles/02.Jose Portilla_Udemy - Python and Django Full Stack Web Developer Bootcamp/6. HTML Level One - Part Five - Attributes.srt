00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,230
Hello everyone and welcome to part five attributes in this lecture we talking about.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,300
Tim attributes would allow us to actually add more information to NHT melted.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,080
And this includes things such as adding a link to another web page or referencing an image.

4
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,190
Let's get started all of this by jumping to the Adam text editor in our browser.

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,910
OK here I am back at the Adam text editor and I'm still using the basic study T.M. file.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,750
You can you sort of reached him if you want.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,350
You can also use the part 5 h HTML attributes file that comes with the actual course notes.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,370
Is going to be editing basic studies Timo.

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,030
Now we're going to need a few things.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,410
One thing we'll need is an actual image file.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:53,380
When we talk about setting an image inside of our page HTML file and to do that we should do is either

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:00,520
find on your computer or download or just use the PMG provided for you in the notes a drop DNG file

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,580
and make sure you save it in the same directory at the.

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,160
Himself all you're working with isn't.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,390
So you can see here I have this basic study to metafile that I'm playing around with in the exact same

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,110
directory.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,020
I have this PMG picture here this image file.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,850
So let me now close that and show you how we can actually insert an image into our h tim L and the way

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,610
we do that is if an image tag.

20
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,600
And that's going to be I m g.

21
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,840
So I'm just going to click enter here and you'll notice you get an automatic pop up that says S R C

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,660
and A L T and that stands for source and ultimate.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,810
And we're going to explain those in just a little bit.

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:45,040
First thing is to notice that this is actually a self-closing tag meaning everything here goes into

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,400
this one image tag.

26
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,690
You don't see as we've seen before in the past.

27
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,510
This closing tag it just comes in one self-contained tags that's called a self-closing tag and we can

28
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,230
actually use this to source an image.

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:06,090
So the thing I'll type here and SIRC for the source of the image is just Django the P and G and then

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,270
I'm going to do control s save and then refresh this page and you'll notice I actually get this image

31
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,820
right here.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,780
And later on we'll learn about resizing images or squeezing them or stretching them however we want.

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,290
Right now we're just using the default image size so you can see here I said image tag.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,940
Check out the source jingle that PAGG and then an alternate.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,290
We're about to discuss.

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,190
Something to note here is that if this file is not in the exact same directory as this H-2 hymnal file

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,220
you may need to put in the entire file path but we'll discuss that much later on we're talking about

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,010
Django when we actually want to link to a specific folder that has all our images and all our documents

39
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,640
in it.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,250
Right now I'll keep things simple by keeping the actual image file in the same directory as they watched

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,780
him file.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,630
Let's discuss this a LTE or alternate.

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,050
Basically what this is for is an alternate thing to display in case you can't find the PMG file.

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,090
So for example let's say I type in missing that P and G.

45
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,860
Now if you look at my directory here I only have Gengel that PNB I don't have some picture called missing

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,740
that pinchy.

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,570
Which means I'll actually have a broken link so if I refresh this we see that classic broken link picture

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,630
that basically says hey I couldn't find this missing PAGG which means it's always a good idea to have

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:35,110
something alternate here so we can say something like oh image not found.

50
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,780
And we passed that in in quotes as a string that will pop up.

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:46,970
Now if I save that and refreshed my page will say something like oh image not found next to this little

52
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,180
broken icon here.

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,910
So that helps us out because later on we're doing more advanced web sites.

54
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,950
I can say something like a little more specific missing.

55
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,030
TNG not found.

56
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,660
So when I'm debugging my web site or checking stuff I immediately know oh missing that PAGG is not found.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:12,470
But you'll notice if I switch this back to Jingo that PNB which is there and I refresh my website I

58
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,380
don't get that alternate image or alternate text anymore.

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,620
It does show up the Django that PMG image and that's really all there is to sourcing an image so you

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:30,410
have the source SIRC and the alternate let me comment that out and refresh this page save this then

61
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,430
refresh my page.

62
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,300
All right.

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,060
So we just discussed how to use image tags.

64
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,790
The next thing I want to talk about is an atack which allows us to actually reference in other ASTM

65
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,040
whole file or another Web site to really show this however I will create another aged him file.

66
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,140
So I'm going to bring back my directory and then right click on whatever folder I'm working on this

67
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:03,030
project folder or I'll add a new file and this new file and going to call it new page h tim L or hit

68
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:09,830
enter and then this new page that to T.M. I'll start typing T.M. enter so I get all that extra stuff.

69
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,830
And then here the body is going to write a letter or heading one that says this is the new page save

70
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,050
that.

71
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,960
So I have to assume all files basics that studied smell that we've been working with and this new page.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,310
H Tim L has just a single heading in it and if I copy this full page and put it in my browser then I

73
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,850
get this is the new page.

74
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,540
Great.

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,750
So what I want to do is try to link this new page or each symbol into my original Basic Set a simple

76
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,600
page.

77
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,060
So let's do that.

78
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,550
I'll come back to basics very simple and to do this I'm going to use in a tag which is just an anchor

79
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,840
Ted and this is going to allow me to pass in a reference there in a ref and I will pass in the reference

80
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,910
to the actual new page or a symbol file that will say new page dot h tim L..

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,800
And notice I don't have to pass right now the full directory path where the full file path to this h

82
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,250
tim l file because it's in the same directory as my basic start.

83
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,210
Tim L. If it was a different situation where this was in in other full there somewhere else on my computer

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,140
I would have to specify more detail the full file path.

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,470
But we'll discuss full file paths and how you should actually create those across different operating

86
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,030
systems.

87
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,910
When we talk about Django right now we'll keep things simple and make sure everything's in the same

88
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,070
directory.

89
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,280
Let me save this so I have my breath in my anchor tag.

90
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,370
But notice this isn't self-closing.

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,880
It has its own closing tab which means I can put stuff in between here and this is basically going to

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:47,260
be the text that is a clickable link and that's all an anchor tag so i can say click me.

93
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,210
I will save this refresh.

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,140
And now I have this attributes and this click me and I can click on click me and that takes me to the

95
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,400
new page.

96
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,600
So again with this anchor tag we keep a reference here have the text that we want to show when we say

97
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,740
click me and then click on that.

98
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,730
And this is the new page.

99
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,920
That's really all N.A. tag is something to know.

100
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,610
You can reference things that are not just local on your computer.

101
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,390
And that goes for images as well.

102
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:23,470
So let me show you what I mean by that we can pass in an actual Web site so I'll say something like

103
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,600
HTP that will be there though.

104
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,020
Facebook dot com and make sure you have to put in the full file path of HTP.

105
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,420
Otherwise this won't work.

106
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,320
And now let's change this from click me to something like Facebook.

107
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,140
We'll save that refresh over here.

108
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,400
And now I see Facebook I click on Facebook and that actually takes me to the Facebook Web site and my

109
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,190
browser will actually self-correct this to make sure it's secure so it goes to HTP S..

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,350
Cole and for Sless for Slash W.W. that Facebook dot com.

111
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,690
All right.

112
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,610
So that's how you can actually reference web sites that are outside of your project folder.

113
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:11,200
You can just pasand the full HCC or HTP s file path instead of a local file and you can actually do

114
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,150
the exact same thing for an image tag.

115
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,990
So for example if we see an image here so I see this image of let's say these little triangles going

116
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,380
to open this image in a new tab.

117
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,080
Here we have the entire image path.

118
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:34,300
So I'm going to actually just copy this image path and then instead of Jingo that PMG I'm going to paste

119
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,950
in that whole image path.

120
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,840
Let's save that and go back to our original web site refresh and we see here.

121
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:49,360
Now we have that image so I'm allowed to basically pass in an outside image and you can use something

122
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,820
like google image search to actually grab a link to an image and then use that as your source instead

123
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,980
of having to save stuff locally.

124
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,600
Now will be times when you definitely want to save stuff locally in case a link ever breaks online.

125
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,180
That way you make sure you always have a backup or you could just use the source online and then have

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
maybe an alternate link or an alternate text show up.

127
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,420
All right.

128
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,350
So that's basically it.

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:20,070
As far as attributes than covering images and anchor tags we've learned a ton of material to this point.

130
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,330
So it's really time that we take a step back make sure we've truly understood everything and tackle

131
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,840
an assessment exercise Thanks everyone.

132
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,210
And I'll see you at the next lecture re-explained the assessment.
