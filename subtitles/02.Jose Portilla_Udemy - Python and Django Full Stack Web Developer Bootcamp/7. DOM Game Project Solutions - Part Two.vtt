00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.150
Welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.970
I'm here right.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.250
We left off last time with the javascript file open.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.730
Again we defined the sections of code that we actually have to code out so let's get started with just

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.650
the restart Game button.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.090
First off let's make the variable let's grab it from the document object model I'm going to say call

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.230
it restart and it's going to be equal to the documents and then I will use queries selector on the document

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.880
and I'm going to grab the tag that I made for it or excuse not the tag the ID.

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.840
I could have also done a button Texas's Deely button on here but lushest do hash tag B.

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.490
So if I look at my main file here I gave it the IDB.

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.260
So that looks good.

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.210
They don't want to grab all the squares to create a variable called squares and then offset that equal

13
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.460
to documents query selector queries selector.

14
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.910
Now let's have it the query selector.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.100
All because I want all the squares and that's going to be the same as all the table cells and something

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.500
to note here is that I spelt squares wrong.

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.310
So there we go.

18
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.860
OK.

19
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.350
So those are all squares and then I want to create a function that clears all the squares.

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.150
So how do we do that.

21
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.490
Well I'll say function.

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.530
Now let's give this function the name clipboard and for this I'll have a for loop that goes for every

23
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.930
cell or everything in the squares and then it just makes the content blank.

24
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.240
So let me show what I mean by that.

25
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.800
We'll say for and the array we're going to be playing with is the squares array.

26
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.140
And then I can click to the activate that.

27
00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.570
So from I will zero all the way to I less than squares that length increasing I'm going to grab the

28
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.050
current cell and then change its text content.

29
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.780
To be blank and that's all I'm doing to clear the board.

30
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.520
So what is actually doing will remember queery selector all is going to return all the table cells and

31
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.650
that I have saved as squares and then we're going to have a function called clipboard that basically

32
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.390
loops through everything in squares every element.

33
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.370
And what is basically acting like an array is not quite a javascript or array but it's acting like one

34
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.310
and then we can just say squares I that text contents and then set that equal to blank.

35
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.020
Let's test to see that this clipboard function works by adding an event listener to restart remember

36
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.530
restart is just our actual restart.

37
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.570
So I will say restart at events.

38
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.200
Listener

39
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.640
and upon a click it's going to call the function clipboard.

40
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.300
So let's save this in right now I have an X in there so I will refresh the page.

41
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.430
It's blank right now.

42
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.050
So if I click restart I'm not going to see any difference.

43
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.190
So I will come back to my main page T.M. and add something to one of these cells.

44
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.100
Let's give it an X.

45
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.330
Refresh my page.

46
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.030
I see that x.

47
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.240
Now if I click restart it was cleared.

48
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.850
So looks like everything's working.

49
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.470
So I'm going to come back here and then clear this so we can refresh this page.

50
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.830
So far we have a function that successfully loops through every cell in the table and clears it makes

51
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.740
its text content nothing.

52
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.160
All right.

53
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.920
Now we've reached what's probably the most challenging part of this project which is getting the board

54
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.420
to display X's and O's or blanks depending on if we click on a cell.

55
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.980
So how can we actually do this.

56
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.180
Well the way you could probably do it given what you know so far is to come back to this H.T. metafile

57
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.860
give each cell a specific ID and then come back to javascript and add event listeners for each particular

58
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.150
ID checking to see if it's blank X or O and then changing the marker depending on where it's been clicked.

59
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.630
So that's one way of doing it.

60
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.190
The official solutions have a way that uses the javascript this keyword that is used in a way we haven't

61
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.910
seen before.

62
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.130
So I'm going to show you first solution that you have the capability to come up with on your own.

63
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.760
However it's repetitive.

64
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.610
Then after that I'll show you the solution that's more advanced and uses this keyword.

65
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.070
But it's a little cleaner and uses a for loop.

66
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.230
So let's start off with the most basic solution we can think of and we'll just run it for one cell.

67
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:58.630
I'm going to give this cell an ID of one and then coming back to my javascript going to make some new

68
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:07.840
lines for myself and we're going to make a variable called cell 1 and have it be equal to the documents

69
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.520
weary selector and then we'll give it the ID of one.

70
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.180
And now we're going to say sell one we'll add an event listener to it.

71
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.620
So there's our event listener and upon click

72
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.170
we'll have it do something.

73
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:42.530
So we'll say function and we'll grab someone and we'll say it's tecs content is going to be equal to

74
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.810
X..

75
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.880
So this is the most basic way we could do this.

76
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.910
Let me refresh the page and make sure is actually working.

77
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.530
So now so when I click on it it becomes x.

78
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.060
If I hit restart then it gets blank.

79
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.280
So right now if I click on it it only turns X once.

80
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.160
So let's add the functionality where it cycles through blank X and 0.

81
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.850
So we can add some logic here in order to make that happen.

82
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:16.190
I'm going to say if sell one that text content is equal to blank.

83
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:27.740
Remember that's how it starts off as then someone text content set that equal to x

84
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.000
LCF

85
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:42.830
cell one that text content is equal to X. Then I'm going to say.

86
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:52.330
So one text content becomes equal to 0 and then else.

87
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.210
Well we're going to be doing here is setting it back equal to blink.

88
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:04.740
So I'll say so on text content is equal to blink.

89
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.200
So this should effectively cycle through X's and O's and let's make sure we actually got the logic right

90
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.690
here.

91
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.180
If I see that the text content is blank I'm going to set the text content to X if when I click on it

92
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.610
I see that the current text content is X..

93
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:28.920
Well then Ill set it be set to zero or 0 and then if it's neither blank nor X then it must be 0.

94
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.450
So I will cycle it back to being blank.

95
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.790
OK let's save this and refresh see if it works.

96
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.550
So here click on this right now.

97
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.160
X.

98
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.140
Click on it again it becomes 0.

99
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.200
Looking at one more time and it's blank.

100
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.120
Great.

101
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.330
So this is what you have the capability and knowledge of doing right now technically then could have

102
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.910
just copied and pasted this eight more times and changed cell one to cell to cell 3 cell 4 et cetera.

103
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.360
And that's how you could solve this problem.

104
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.230
OK so this is the solution you would have probably come up with and you would just copy and paste this

105
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:08.160
maybe eight more times and that's one way of doing it without using the this keyword.

106
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.020
And that's one of the most basic ways of doing it.

107
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.740
However it really violates the dry principle of coding which is don't repeat yourself.

108
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.470
So we're going to be doing is showing you how you can use the this keyword to do something really similar

109
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.650
except not have it be repeated so often.

110
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:30.130
So I'm going to create a function and I will call this function change marker and it's essentially going

111
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.100
to be a very generic version of what we just wrote.

112
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:42.320
I'm going to say if and then I'm going to use the this keyword text content is equal to x excuse me

113
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:52.210
is equal to blank then we'll end up doing is saying this text content and there should have been triple

114
00:08:52.210 --> 00:09:00.550
equal sign and then we'll reset this to be X then we'll have an LCF and this is going to say if this

115
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:13.590
text content is equal to x then I'm going to set this text content equal to 0 and then else if that's

116
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:22.330
the case then I won't say this text content and set it back equal to being blank.

117
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.670
All right so that's the most generic version of this and it's using this keyword and this is inside

118
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.570
of a function which you haven't really seen before we've only seen this keyword inside a method inside

119
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.940
an object but a function is pretty similar to a method so hopefully this is making sense to you so far

120
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.350
especially since we just ran the more specific version of this.

121
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.540
This is basically the generic version.

122
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:50.420
So we need to do is add this as an event listener for all the squares.

123
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.550
So I will say for.

124
00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:04.270
And then I will again loop through squares and then I'm going to say Dot add in events listener and

125
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.480
upon click.

126
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.820
I'm going to call change marker.

127
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.820
And now let's refresh our page and see if this works.

128
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.340
So it's working on the first one.

129
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.030
And now I can see it's working on any of them.

130
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.550
So this is the tic tac toe project and that's really all you have to do.

131
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.310
And now when I click restart it gets cleared.

132
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.440
That's the most generic version of solving that issue.

133
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.660
X's and O's.

134
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.640
Would I expect you to solve this on your own with this solution.

135
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.270
Maybe.

136
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.060
Probably not.

137
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.830
It's a little more advanced and it's a little beyond the scope of what we covered in the sections of

138
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:46.330
the course about javascript but don't worry in the next section we're going to be covering J.

139
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.750
Queery which is going to give you the skills to naturally come up with a much smoother and better way

140
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.630
of accessing document object model material or properties.

141
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.260
OK.

142
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.040
I hope you enjoy the project.

143
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.360
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
