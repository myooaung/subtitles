00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,240
Hello everyone and welcome back to the Part 1 h t m l basics lecture.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,290
Let's start off by exploring the very basics of what an H Tim L file looks like and how he can open

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,530
it in a browser.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,400
Plus learn about some Adam text editor.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,500
Convenience features to quickly create him files.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor now.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:26,830
All right.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,080
Here I am at the Adam text editor as a quick note.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,510
You can either just code along and create new files in the project folders that are provided for you

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,210
as a download to the course or you can add your new project folders or new files as you go along.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,500
It's really up to you.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:49,610
You can always just right click and click a new file new folder or just add a whole new project folder

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,520
so you can see a new folder over here.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,790
It's really up to you.

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,610
I've already created a project folder called the Tim underscore level underscore one in another quick

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:58,970
note.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,490
Try to avoid using just spaces in your folder names and in your file names you should always try to

18
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,290
replace them with something like an underscore to make sure that you can read the whole file path with

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,210
your computer.

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,570
Sometimes spaces will mess the computer up in reading the actual file path.

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,210
So just a quick note on that.

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:24,590
OK let's start off by creating a new file and we will call it basic stop h Timo and we can do uppercase

23
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,580
or lowercase here.

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,050
I'll just keep it simple lowercase because that's usually what they look like.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,740
All right.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,920
So here's a basic slide each T.M. And one thing I want to show you is I can begin to type H T.M..

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,740
And you'll notice that Adam text editor has this little pop up that says H him l.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,810
If I hit enter when I see that pop up I will get the basically boilerplate code as it's called or the

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,020
skeleton code of and HVM file.

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,790
Now let's walk through this and explain what's actually going on in this very first line we see something

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,380
that says doc type H Tim L and that's something you are going to find in pretty much all the stem cell

32
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,110
files.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,970
And that basically just tells the browser hey you're looking at an age HTML file.

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,680
Then we have the team l tags.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,890
You'll notice we have an opening tag here at the line number two and a closing tag over in line number

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,500
10 and difference between the opening and closing tag.

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,900
Is it just lets you know when that starts and when it stops and the closing will notice has a little

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,260
forward slash in it.

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,840
And what's nice about Adam text editor is you'll see these little arrows pop up which just allow you

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:33,560
to collapse or open things between their opening and closing tags so that's just for organization.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,200
Then we have two major sections.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,810
The head of the team M-file and the body of the team are File.

43
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,500
Let's start off by just explaining what the head is the head of the HMO which is this first section

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,710
is going to contain the meta data and for this first section of the course the H team at level 1 we

45
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,570
won't be doing a whole lot with the actual head of the L that will come into play a lot more than we

46
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:04,160
actually UCSF in javascript but it's going to mainly serve as how to link your HMO document to other

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,960
types of files such as your CSSA file or your database javascript's file but another tag that we noticed

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
it's NHT male head.

49
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,720
Is this title tag.

50
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,190
And that's basically what's going to show up as the title when you open this up in a browser and the

51
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,260
title is just what's shown in the tab.

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,970
So I'm going to type in in-between this title tag something like this is the title exclamation mark.

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,600
And notice I don't need any quotes here.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,430
It's just pure text in between these tags.

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,330
And h tim l will recognize it and then this other meta data is just telling you what character set you

56
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,860
would expect and that's UTF 8 encoding.

57
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,220
Don't worry about that too much right now.

58
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,910
Then finally we have the body and the body is going to contain the actual content.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,010
We're going to be discussing actual content such as paragraphs and lists etc. throughout this section

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,830
of the course.

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,140
Right now we'll leave the body blank.

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,510
Last thing I want to show you before we actually view the safe's female file in our browser is how to

63
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,730
comment code.

64
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,380
So and ASTM l comments look like this.

65
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,280
You do a opening tag.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,840
Exclamation mark dash dash.

67
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,360
And that says that's the start of the comment and then the end of the comment is dash dash.

68
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,400
The other closing sign and then anything here is a comment.

69
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,730
The other quick way to do this is if you have some text or a line of code you can just do a control

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,870
or command depending on your OS.

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,570
A forward slash in Adam and sublime text editor will actually just auto comment everything there.

72
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:51,390
Or if you wanted to you can actually highlight many lines and then do control forward slash to comment

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,340
or control forward slash to uncomment.

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,930
All right.

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,880
So anything in between those two types of tags is a comment and it's just control or command forward

76
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,560
slash to quickly make a line or multiple lines in actual comments and when you do control s here to

77
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,520
save this then let's open this up in a browser.

78
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:17,010
So the way we open this up in our browser is by just passing in the entire file path into the browser.

79
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,070
For now we're going to be just running things locally.

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,790
So that's how it will work.

81
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,950
I'm going to right click on MH T.M. file and then say copy full path.

82
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,370
So it will copy the full path to that and then let me bring in a browser window.

83
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,940
And here is a browser window and what I can do is right where my browser usually goes.

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm going to just copy and paste that file path.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,980
So this is just the whole file path to that actual HTL file.

86
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,480
I hit enter and I noticed something that's just basically a blank page and that makes sense we haven't

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,540
provided any content or each content in the body of each team I'll file but what we do notice is this

88
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,450
our little this is the title in the title actually showed up.

89
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,560
Perfect.

90
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,270
So that's really all there is for the very basics of an AFEs Himmel file.

91
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,140
What NH him I'll file mostly will be as we work with it or the actual body tags.

92
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,250
So let's go ahead and continue on by editing this file with body tags in part 2 in the next lecture.

93
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,170
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
