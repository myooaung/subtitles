00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.310
Hello everyone and welcome back to the solutions lecture for the TMI level 2 assessment.

2
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.970
Let's get started by jumping straight to the editor.

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.980
All right so here I have the editor and the course Sign-Up page opened.

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.060
I am just going to start straight from scratch.

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.750
But remember this is what we're trying to recreate here.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.000
H t m l.

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.040
So the first thing I want to do is just call him I'll give this some sort of title we'll just say Course

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.010
Sign-Up and then let's start off with the body.

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.510
So here we can see there's some sort of heading one and we will say of course sign Sign-Up page to match

10
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.180
that.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.730
And then we have what appears to be a paragraph to it then heading to reading three That's fine and

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.780
we'll say please no

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.450
we'll say all text fields required just to save us some time and then we start with the real business

14
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.840
which is the form.

15
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.070
So I'll call the form right now and we will remove class action in a post.

16
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.250
There was a bonus on the action which we'll cover in just a little bit towards the end.

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.490
Let's start off with the basic form.

18
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.790
First thing you wanted to do is the inputs.

19
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.730
So we have a first name and put in a last name and put Let's grab those inputs the first name is just

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.110
a text input.

21
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.910
It has no value but it does have a placeholder so let's put that in here or put it placeholder in that

22
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.140
says first name and then let's just label this.

23
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.560
We'll give it a label.

24
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.330
And we'll say it's for F am.

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.150
Her first name and we'll give the input an ID of FM and then let's come back up here and give it the

26
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.370
label first name Colin.

27
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.860
All right.

28
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.010
Now we're going to do a very similar thing for the last name so let's do that as well.

29
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.220
Let's copy this and paste it.

30
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.190
Let's make this last name let's come up here and change this to Elham for last name.

31
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.010
It looks like I actually wrote them and sort of.

32
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.090
And so let's change those on both of these l n and F and first name last name and then the placeholder

33
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.060
here sort of first name is going to say last name.

34
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.180
All right so so far we have an extra t there.

35
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.580
So far we have the first two inputs for the first name and the last name.

36
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.410
Let's save this and make sure we're connected.

37
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.420
Make sure things are working correctly.

38
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.480
I will repeat that.

39
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.040
Enter Elix are good to go here of course sign a page of text textfield are required first name and last

40
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.800
names to remember is that they're all required.

41
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.980
Which means I need to add one more parameter here in my input which is just the required keyword and

42
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.870
I need to do the same thing here required.

43
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.280
You can see that Adam is already ready to help me out.

44
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.030
Now you just need to.

45
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.250
You could say it equals two.

46
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.510
True but that's all I really need here.

47
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.700
OK.

48
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.450
Then up next we want the email that we had earlier.

49
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.460
So again I will say input this time I'll say e-mail and I will give the placeholder.

50
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.800
Now let's just say the placeholder is user at gmail dot com or something like that.

51
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.020
Can't remember quite what it was but we'll put a label here and we'll say this label is for the let's

52
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:43.310
say email Rowse call it male so we don't confuse it with the type and give it an ID of male and then

53
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.610
for the label we will say email and then finally we also want a password.

54
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.970
So again I will make a label here will say it's for pass call password there.

55
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.040
And then create the input for it input and you notice it's because a lot faster when using Adam's really

56
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.930
helpful auto complete.

57
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.310
So we will say password and no placeholder there.

58
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.850
Let's save this and see what it looks like.

59
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.380
So far we're probably going to change something that we have a bit of a basically no gap between first

60
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.710
name last name email and password.

61
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.210
So one quick fix we can do that since we don't know styling it is to just in-between first name and

62
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.780
last name add some paragraph tags to insert another block there and we can just keep them blanks and

63
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.940
I want to refresh this.

64
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.330
We get a little empty block there later on when we learn about CSSA.

65
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.440
We're going to learn how we can actually call styling for buffers and margins et cetera.

66
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.000
Right now we can just use this little cheat.

67
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.470
OK.

68
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.970
So you have all the text fields and let's make sure we have them all required.

69
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.270
So we still need to add those to the last two we just created.

70
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.980
So it required and then down here we also want to add in required and you don't need to say equals in

71
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.120
our case we can just say required there.

72
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.850
Then up next we want to get if some radio buttons ask for over the age of 18 yes or no has put a paragraph

73
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.670
in here saying Are you over 18.

74
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:31.030
Question mark will need two inputs and they're both going to be radio is going to be input.

75
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.650
Call it radio.

76
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.780
And remember if you want to be linked to share the same name so we'll call them both over asking if

77
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.070
they're over 18 and let's give them a label.

78
00:05:47.310 --> 00:06:01.890
So say label for Y is yes and then give the first one an ID of Y and then so we can recognize it later.

79
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:09.290
Let's give it a value of yes and let's give this one a value of no and give it a label.

80
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.200
And the reason for that is later on whenever they select I can reference the value there.

81
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:23.380
So we'll put in a label here for an ID equal to an.

82
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.910
And then here it's going to be no.

83
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.700
So let's say that make sure everything's working correctly for us.

84
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.990
Or your routine let's make sure they're linked together and looks like that's working just fine.

85
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.840
All right.

86
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.520
Can even expand this a little bit.

87
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.700
And Dallas check out the last thing we needed to do which was a drop them.

88
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.240
You have a credit card or PayPal.

89
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:55.090
So let's just say you have a card or Paypal question mark or remember the dropdown doesn't use an input

90
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.420
tag.

91
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.990
Instead it uses a selects tag.

92
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.940
So we have selects we can give it a class but we don't worry about that and also give it a name which

93
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.760
is give it a simple name we'll say payments and then finally inside of this we have the option tags

94
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.240
so option one will say this is the value of CC and we'll give it the actual name on each T.M. credit

95
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.500
card or excuse me not really a name but what it's actually going to display.

96
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:32.250
And then the next option value here will say Peepy for Paypal and then PayPal there.

97
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.290
So let's save that.

98
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.020
Make sure it's working when I refresh this.

99
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.790
Do you have a credit card or PayPal.

100
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.560
Here we can select them perfect.

101
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:47.180
And when I actually click Submit I'll get back evaluate either CC or Peepy for payment x.

102
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.360
Finally let's use that paragraph trick again and put the submit button.

103
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.710
So put submit and the value will give it is

104
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.270
and let's save this now let's confirm that it all worked or fresh This will put in a first name and

105
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.530
the last name.

106
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:17.990
But in some e-mail it's just made up and that's a password over 18 credit card to sign up.

107
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.320
Which should just basically refresh the page.

108
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.120
And if we look over here on the your elf expand this I see the options that I wanted.

109
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.740
Perfect.

110
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.010
So what we can do now is to expand on this.

111
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:38.460
You could add values so you could give password a value an email a value if you wanted to show up here

112
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.480
that you are after clicking submit but that doesn't help us too much right now because they don't know

113
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.690
how to use stuff on the back end to actually grab those values.

114
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.200
So we'll leave it there for now.

115
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:53.250
What I want to address is the actual bonus question which was how can you make this Sign-Up link to

116
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.550
another page or another HMO file.

117
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.150
And remember we can do that through inaction.

118
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.620
So I will call action here.

119
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:08.550
And what I will do is I will creates by bring back might the rectory with control or command backslash

120
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.070
or create a new file here.

121
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.740
Now I will say thank you not HMO and here it's just going to be an HTML file.

122
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.000
With one headings saying thank you.

123
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.040
We all say that.

124
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.690
And then the action is going to take us to that.

125
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.310
Thank you.

126
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.720
Timo and the message will be get save that.

127
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.760
So looks really similar to what we should earlier when we actually lead to the Facebook page.

128
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.980
Then instead now the action is linked to a local aged him and make sure it's in the same directory that

129
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.270
we don't have the pass and the whole file path you just pass.

130
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.680
Thank you ladies T.M..

131
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.540
So I will save that refreshed this Allen and make sure I refresh that correctly.

132
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.300
Enter.

133
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:57.610
OK.

134
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.100
Course sign up page.

135
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.840
Let's zoom out a little bit.

136
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.930
So it's still OK.

137
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:09.500
I'll put it the same information as last time Protea some made up e-mail address made up password over

138
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.320
18 credit card Sign-Up and it takes us to think Page hopefully you're able to figure out that bonus

139
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.190
as well.

140
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.740
But what I really want you to see is now we're actually ready to almost level up to understanding how

141
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.390
we can link pages together and that's going to be a really big part of creating that web application.

142
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:32.750
How pages linked to each other and how your whole web application is designed to interact with itself.

143
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.350
All right.

144
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:39.640
So let's just quickly review everything we just did by grabbing this guy and expanding it.

145
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.330
So we had to do is created that heading one just a paragraph.

146
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.740
We had the form and if you did the bonus you wanted to select action and method to some other HVM l

147
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.490
page you had or if you wanted to just another web site.

148
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.670
Remember for the Web site need a passen HTP cetera.

149
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.970
Otherwise I'll start looking in the local namespace.

150
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:04.190
Which means on your computer then we want to use labels we have the input for these tax number we had

151
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.940
to make sure they were all required.

152
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.910
We had the first name last name had the placeholders mixture that required this little trick or the

153
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.720
paragraph.

154
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.060
Don't worry if you didn't get that yet you don't need it.

155
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.650
Later on we actually learned about C Ss So if you were having difficult do that.

156
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.620
Don't sweat it.

157
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:25.820
It's kind of a trick then coming up next we had to have this e-mail label password.

158
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.810
Again it was required.

159
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.150
Are you over 18.

160
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.690
The trick here is when you're dealing with radio buttons and you want them to be linked together make

161
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.740
sure they have the same name.

162
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.440
In this case it was over and over and assigning values to the text fields wasn't really necessary for

163
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.880
our use case but obviously you will have to assign values to them.

164
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.980
Where are we dealing a full web application.

165
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.310
So keep that in mind.

166
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.770
Then finally we have this dropdown menu of Carter Pay-Pal and that's the select tag with the option

167
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.600
tag and then we had the submit button.

168
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.440
OK.

169
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.220
Hope you enjoyed that assessment exercise.

170
00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.790
And you basically know enough HTL now to continue on with the rest of the course.

171
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.200
Thanks everyone and I will see you at the next section.
