Hello everyone and welcome back to the solutions lecture for the Django challenge.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,790
Well we're going to be doing this lecture video is just going through the solutions to the previous

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,940
challenges together.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,210
If you are able to figure it all out then you can go ahead and just skip this lecture.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,320
But if you want to see the process gone through one more time feel free to stick around as I go through

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,780
it.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,160
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor to get started OK here I am at the Adam text editor.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,260
Now the first thing we needed to do was actually create a new Django project so I'll just go ahead and

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,550
put this under that same.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,830
My Django stuff folder that we had earlier makes you change directories so you're matched to it.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,320
And then well I will go ahead and do is say Django dash adamant.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,860
What was.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,820
And then I do the starts project command.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,410
Hopefully we're able to remember that and then whatever you want to name the project in this case we'll

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,590
call it something like pro to we'll hit enter and then we can see here that the project too has been

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,010
created.

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,880
So under my jingoes stuff I had this new pro to folder and it's ready to go.

18
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,980
Then the next thing I needed to do was actually create an application inside of this pro to project.

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,810
So I will do is change the rectory to be inside of Pro-Tools.

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:27,980
So I will say see the two row to and now I should be aligned of this managed up by file so I can call

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,190
that file and then call start app and create that second app.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,710
So say Python managed up PI and then the commander I want to call for that the star app and then let's

23
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:49,830
call this something like app to create it or it can see we have app 2 inside of that project too.

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,860
Great.

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,950
Then the next thing you want to do is actually create a view.

26
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,140
So I click here on a view and here we say create your views here.

27
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,010
So let's fill in the needed information.

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,200
The typical view is shown you how to do so far requires that HTP response and we need to actually import

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,690
that.

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,820
We will say from jingo.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,920
H t t p import HTP response.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,590
And then we'll go ahead and create that index for you which is going to be DPF to create that function

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,440
index and then it takes on a request.

34
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,900
Remember this could actually be called whatever you want but by convention it's request and we will

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:43,580
return that HTP response and pass in some code and in this case actually wanted you to pasan some H

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Tim L So will say my second project and then close off the H team Elkhead am.

37
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:59,690
Now obviously you won't be passing in an entire h m l string here for most usual circumstances but I

38
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,180
just wanted to show you what would happen in case you wanted to test out the capabilities of Django

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,760
for this views that py file.

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,150
So I will save that and then we need to link this new view to our u r l.

41
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,930
So I come over here to you or else start.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,350
Scroll down and then we have the URL pattern's list.

43
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:31,270
And just like we did last time and going to say from and in this case it's going to be app to import

44
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,700
views that views that py file and then under your patterns.

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm going to say your L looks good and to have that in your l using regular expression.

46
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,070
I'm going to use just like we did last time the Chevron with the dollar sign.

47
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:00,420
And then as a second argument let's make sure we only have one single quote there I will say buse dot

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,100
index.

49
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,650
So I call index off of that and then we'll just give that the name index comma to complete that.

50
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,980
And then finally I need to edit my settings that PI file under pro 2 to let the actual project know

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,750
that my app 2 application actually exists.

52
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:28,960
So again we come down here until we see installed apps and I will add in here as an argument that app

53
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,640
too.

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,790
And then I will save this then we can actually run our server and make sure everything works correctly.

55
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:48,270
Let's go ahead and do that just come down here and I will say Python managed up high run server enter

56
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,680
lets make sure everything works out OK.

57
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,500
Looks like we're running it here.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,900
So I'm going to copy this.

59
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,690
Put it into my browser and hopefully we see that string.

60
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,200
My second project and looks like it came out well in the drag it over.

61
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,610
Now we can see here we have my second project in a taluk So it's actually able to understand that that's

62
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,960
HVM L when it reports back that view.

63
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,670
And what I want you to do is sort of get used to this workflow of creating a project and creating applications

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,290
hopefully you feel comfortable with the few commands that we've learned so far.

65
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,580
All right.

66
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,550
That's really all there is to this challenge.

67
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,280
If you were getting stuck on anything or had any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums and I'll

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,670
be happy to help you there.

69
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,910
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
