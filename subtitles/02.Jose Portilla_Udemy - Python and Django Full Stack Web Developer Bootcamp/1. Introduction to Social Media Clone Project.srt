00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,960
Welcome to your next social clone project in this project we're going to be taking bits and pieces from

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:17,560
other social sites to build our own platform and our site is basically going to be a social outer space

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,710
fan community site.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,910
So people who are big fans of things that do have outer space can come here and be part of the site

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,950
this clone project also takes full advantage of some of jingoes onepoint elevons newest features such

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,550
as loggin view and log out view.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,730
So the basic idea of the site is that users can create groups on various topics that have to do with

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,420
outer space things like Space X NASA Pluto etc..

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,070
They can then create posts inside those groups and they can also leave and join other groups.

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,980
Let's discuss a few of the key features.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,980
So as I mentioned there are groups in this web site similar to things like sublets except for just calling

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,970
them groups.

13
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:01,300
There's also multiple users and authorisations just like any social media site or a social network site.

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,960
There's also posts inside the group similar to posting a tweet.

15
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,120
We're also going to be linking user profiles with an at symbol.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,400
So if you ever see a user name somewhere there's a little symbol attached to it you can click on that

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
symbol and then go straight to their profile.

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,160
And there's also multiple applications.

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,220
Unlike the previous clone project.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,320
Let's take a quick peek at the actual project and remember you can download the zip file in this lecture

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,490
as a resource which has all the code that we're going to be needing for this project.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,360
Let's jump to the browser and check out the project.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,630
All right.

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,790
This is what the Web site actually looks like it's called Star social and let's say it's the best community

25
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,410
for all things on outer space.

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,500
And one of the funny little features of it is with javascript and CSSA we can't create stars and let

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,980
him bounce around etc..

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,260
So the main idea is that we could sign up as a new user and then we get this sign up page.

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,310
So we have at this plaining so we'll call this space fan.

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,330
One is our display name.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,560
Give this an email address of hello at gmail and then we'll say test password and we need to confirm

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,780
our password so we'll say test password.

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,950
I didn't mess that up.

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,520
There we go.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,030
And now let's log in.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:17,580
So I'll a space fan 1 and lie test password log in and it says Now I'm logged in.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,830
Go to groups saw select go to groups and I can see there's some groups already created here for me so

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,490
I can create a new group and it will tell me it's create a new group.

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:36,900
So we'll give this group something that says like NASA rocks and then we'll say people who like NASA

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,010
will create that group so we can then join the group.

41
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,950
So it has no members right now so we'll join the group and now we can see has a member count of 1.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,250
So there's no posts in this group yet.

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,650
Now you notice that we have a post button a group button and a create group button will be on groups.

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,770
And now you can see in the group list we have my new group Nassor rocks and then the second group so

45
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,680
we can end up doing is posting to any of these if I click on post it allows me to do and you message

46
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:13,020
so I'll say first post in NASA exclamation point and then I'll choose this Nassor rocks group hit post

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,340
and then I can see here I'm not superzoom then but hopefully you can see this.

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll zoom in a little more that I have the first post in Assa space fan and I can see space fan once

49
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,380
I had this little symbol I have the time I post it.

50
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,630
And NASA rocks.

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,310
And if I hit on a space fan 1 there is my post history at space fan 1 and it's basically since I only

52
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,110
have one post.

53
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,590
There it is.

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,070
And I can also delete posts so I can hit delete here.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,860
It says Are you sure you want to delete this post.

56
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,190
I can either confirm to delete or cancel it so I'll just confirm that delete etc now takes me back to

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,660
just a list of all the posts currently available for me.

58
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,850
So again it groups.

59
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,690
I can see members I can join other groups etc..

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,950
All right there's a lot to this project even though it seems pretty simple on the back and there's a

61
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,220
lot going on but it's going to feel like a natural extension of our blog project.

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,050
So let's discuss various things to know about this project and how to approach it.

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,620
A hop back to the presentation slides now so as I previously mentioned you can download the zip files

64
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,750
in this lecture for all of the code and this project workflow will also be a bit different than the

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,040
previous project.

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,300
We're going to be focusing on a more realistic development process where we build out applications one

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,430
by one versus the previous project where we kind of built all the views first and then all the templates

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,810
etc. We're actually going to focus on applications one at a time.

69
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,280
And this approach we take here is definitely going to be more realistic but by its nature it's also

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,690
going to contain a lot more debugging especially because some applications depend on other applications.

71
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,450
And while the blogging isn't very fun when first learning a concept by now you've learned enough that

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,220
you feel really comfortable enough to debug often so keep that in mind as you approach these videos

73
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,050
you're going to see us debugging a lot.

74
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,970
But it's definitely part of a realistic development process.

75
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,510
OK.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Another note is that we're also going to be using some outside libraries to keep this in mind.

77
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,420
If you happen to just immediately run the file that's in the resource for this lecture.

78
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,240
If you don't have the right modules installed you may get something that says No module names etc..

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,270
Then these can be easily fixed of just a simple Pipp install in your environment or in your virtual

80
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,620
environment and we'll do this in the video lectures as well as you run into those modules so keep that

81
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,120
in mind.

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,250
If you get something that says maybe no module named bootstrap theory then you may have to install bootstrap

83
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,190
3 OK.

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,350
This project is also specifically designed to feel like an extension of the previous block clone project.

85
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,890
And what I really want to get across here is thinking of social media Web sites as extensions of simple

86
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,590
blogs will really help your understanding as far as building a social media website with Django.

87
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,180
So remember that we created a text blog for a single user really similar to medium dot com if it was

88
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,050
just a simple single user blog site.

89
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,220
Now we're going to try to do is expand this concept of a blog site to an actual social media site by

90
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,160
simply expanding to multiple users.

91
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,040
So let's think of this in some examples.

92
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,520
Instagram.

93
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,840
You could technically think of as just a photo blog with multiple users.

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,960
Twitter is literally just a microblog service with Again multiple users.

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,680
YouTube is just a video blog service with multiple users.

96
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,330
They'll be full.

97
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,190
However it does take a lot more work than I'm kind of throwing out here to build sites like these especially

98
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,220
at scale but the basic premise is the same.

99
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,190
We can expand the idea of a single blog for a single user attach multiple users to it.

100
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,120
And now we're dealing with a social media network especially if things like Instagram Twitter or YouTube

101
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,940
where they're especially focused on a particular type of post or blog.

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,010
OK so these ideas are still there.

103
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,980
More importantly you now have awesome jingle skills and we're going to learn even more.

104
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,270
So let's get started building out our site of Social Network.

105
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,910
Thanks and I'll see it the next lecture.
