00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,100
Hello everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,470
Welcome to the bootstrap section of the course.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,690
Bootstrap is a very common framework to use for front and web development and it's actually going to

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,830
help us save a lot of time from dealing with CSSA manually.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,560
But first we need to ask ourselves what is a framework what makes it different than just a library or

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,050
some sort of package.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,330
Well a framework has a couple of key qualities.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,720
Some of those qualities are inversion of control meaning you're giving up control to the framework and

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,910
the framework is going to have some sort of default behavior.

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,100
And it's a non modifiable framework code.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,080
And basically what this means is the framework is going to be defining the rules for you to follow not

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,010
the other way around.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:55,470
Usually we've been seeing ourselves write some code defining the rules and then executing the code.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,700
Here the framework is going to tell you what the rules are as far as how you can manipulate the code.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,380
So there's an inversion of control there between what we're used to and we'll get more use of this idea

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:14,220
of what a framework is when we reach Django because Django itself is a web framework for Python now

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,500
a large part of bootstrap is not memorization but really understanding how to reference the documentation

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,200
for your own use cases and this section will focus on some of the more common use cases of bootstrap.

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,170
But the main thing to get across here is your ability to reference the documentation understand what

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,710
you need to get out of it and then apply it to your own web site before we begin though let's talk about

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,670
bootstrap version 3 versus version 4.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,490
So bootstrap 4 is currently still in development at the time of this filming and will be released soon.

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,710
Right now it's an alpha so likely beta will come out after that and then after that we'll get some sort

24
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,840
of first initial release.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,080
Now it may already be released by the time you're viewing this video but if it hasn't yet bootstrap

26
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,070
actually makes it really easy for me to use the alpha version or the beta version that that's out by

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,930
the time you're watching this right now so you can actually quickly and easily use whatever the current

28
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,370
version of bootstrap for is.

29
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,950
While bootstrap theory is still the main release for our level of use the differences between version

30
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,070
3 and version 4 won't really be apparent to us.

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,590
We're not going to dive so deep into bootstrap that these differences are even going to be on our radar

32
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,930
while version 4 is a major rewrite from Version 3.

33
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,810
We are really not going to dive deep enough to notice any of the differences.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,140
A few of the differences are things such as panels are now being replaced by something called cards

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,390
larger default font sizes.

36
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,990
There's a new grids here.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,440
The use of flex box throughout the version for framework and a move from less to SAS.

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,390
Now a lot of these terms if you're new to bootstrap and to see assess probably don't mean anything to

39
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,790
you.

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,930
And you have no idea what I'm referencing here.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,310
If that's the case really don't worry about it.

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,260
We're not going to dive into bootstrap so deep in this course nor will we need to that we need to understand

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,300
all these differences between version 3 and version 4.

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,170
So again the most important thing to get out of this section of the course is the ability to reference

45
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,970
the bootstrap documentation.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,050
So let's explore the documentation and see some examples of what bootstrap actually looks like.

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,480
The documentation is amazing it's full of examples that makes it really easy to copy and paste and modify

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,890
in your own code.

49
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,610
Let's go to get bootstrap dot com.

50
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,260
OK so here Eric get bootstrapped dot com you'll see a little banner here that says Ayyash bootstrap

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,950
4 is coming.

52
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,870
You can click on that if you want more information on Version 4 but you'll notice that there's actually

53
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,410
links on quickly getting started with a version for right now.

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,450
It's in alpha.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,180
So who knows.

56
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,700
By the time you're viewing this video it may already be in beta or it may already be on its first release.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,620
But let's go back and work of the current release which is right now version 3 and again for our use

58
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,180
cases.

59
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,380
Either one will work fine for you.

60
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,850
So if you click on dialup bootstrap it takes you to this getting started link and there's essentially

61
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,770
two ways to use bootstrap.

62
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,980
As far as in conjunction with pure web application you can either download the source code itself which

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,360
is going to be the font files the source less some javascript etc. or you can actually just use what's

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:26,270
known as a Cdn a C The n is a content delivery network and you can think of it as essential to working

65
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,840
in a really similar manner to how we use google fonts.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,600
So Google fonts API or the font library that or essentially Ladas to copy and paste a CDN link into

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,380
free html file and then it just got the files over the Internet and that's basically what we can do

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,050
here.

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,470
We can see the links here.

70
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,930
That allow us to copy and paste into our HMO file to actually leak to boot strap which is great.

71
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,950
You can see here there's a stylesheet as well as some compile them in a fight Javascript.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,330
And we'll be talking about this when we actually open up the editor and start dealing with bootstrap.

73
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,240
But essentially we're going to be copying these links.

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,420
You can also manually download the links and then save them onto your computer and link to the local

75
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,770
reference on your computer.

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,480
But that just is a bunch of downloaded files that we don't really need.

77
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,950
If you're trying to make your application self-hosted without any internet maybe you're going on a train

78
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,580
ride or something you want to play around a bootstrap then you will have to download it manually that

79
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,140
way.

80
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,600
But if you have access to the internet then you can just use CDN.

81
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,060
And if you're watching video then it's most likely they do have access to the Internet.

82
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,950
OK.

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,350
So coming back up here I want to explore the documentation a little more if you need to click on getting

84
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,860
started.

85
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,080
You'll take it to this link and you'll notice that beyond the download there's just basic information

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,610
like what's included.

87
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,760
Which is right here is what pre-compiled nuestra looks like.

88
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,570
It's really just a bunch of the SS files bunch font files and then two javascript files here.

89
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,370
There's the bootstrap source code and then if you keep going down there is just basic information basic

90
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,890
template information etc..

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,260
And then there's some examples so here are some examples of what the framework looks like.

92
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,790
Click on these to open up in New tabs.

93
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,100
Hopefully you can begin to see an idea of what bootstrap actually does.

94
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,000
So here are some very simple templates of what bootstrap looks like.

95
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,190
So you can see there's a nav bar here.

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,860
There is some sort of theme example and then there are some buttons here.

97
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,820
There's also the grid template which we'll be talking about later on.

98
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,820
There's a Jumbotron template there is a narrow template again if a jumbo tron here.

99
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,100
And then there's a nut bar template and we're going to be walking through a lot of these things throughout

100
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,070
the section of the course.

101
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,170
Jumbotron snack bars grids.

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,210
Those are all really common things that we are going to cover with bootstrap.

103
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,730
But for specific things if you scroll back up here and click on components this will take you through

104
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,810
basically all the components at CSA or excuse me bootstrap has to offer.

105
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,230
So if you want more details on for instance a nav bar you just click here on the side the nav bar and

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,470
has really great documentation I'll tell you what the default nav bar it looks like and that it has

107
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,950
tons of example code.

108
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,400
So this is an example of what this nav bar looks like.

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,570
So you can see has a dropdown menu and will be discussing what this looks like later on.

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,430
And that also has a code for it so you can always reference the code as well as what the code is going

111
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,060
to look like.

112
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,610
So if you want a brand image in your now bar it shows an example what that looks like and shows the

113
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,570
example what that code looks like.

114
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,780
You want forms input forms you know.

115
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,180
Or maybe a search button shows you what that looks like as well.

116
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,340
So you keep going down here maybe you want to check out how progress bars work with bootstrap.

117
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,770
Well you just click on bootstrap here on progress bars and you can see the basic example of what a progress

118
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,090
bar looks like.

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,950
And it shows you the code for as well.

120
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,990
Then if you want to label it also shows you that you can see that bootstrap is basically just a bunch

121
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,990
of predefined CSSA styles that are really going to help you.

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,030
And they each have their own class and we're going to discuss how to actually use these and a lot more

123
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,650
detail in future lectures.

124
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,240
What I want to do is get out this lecture is the fact that you can reference basically anything you

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,370
want about this strap and C example code for as well as what it looks like.

126
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,530
All on the documentation page.

127
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,040
OK.

128
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,670
So the very first thing we're going to be discussing we talk about bootstrap is how to use these buttons

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,020
these really simple buttons and you'll see that they actually already have classes defined to them so

130
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,410
very basic examples look like this lift left middle right but they'll also have their own colored classes

131
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,980
which are going to be exploring later on.

132
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,820
All right.

133
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,760
So go ahead.

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,920
I encourage you to just jump around the documentation and check it out.

135
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,440
But coming up next we're going to talk a lot more about bootstrap and buttons.

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,340
Thanks everyone.

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,390
I'll see you at the next lecture.
