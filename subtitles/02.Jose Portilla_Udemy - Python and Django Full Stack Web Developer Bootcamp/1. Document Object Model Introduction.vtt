Hello everyone and welcome to the document object model section of the course.

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.300
In this section we're going to be learning about the document object model or DCOM Domm and the document

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.100
object model is going to allow us to interface our javascript code to directly interactive.

4
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.680
H Tim Allen CSSA on a web page.

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.600
So far we've already learned that have a pretty good understanding of the three main front end technologies.

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.630
That's simple for the web site content CSSA for the styling of that content and then javascript which

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.700
can interact with the Web site each TMLC assess and actually manipulate what you see on the page.

8
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.500
Well we actually don't know how to do yet is how to really connect that javascript with H.M.S. assess

9
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
how can we use javascript to directly interact with the H.M.S. assess and change what the user is actually

10
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.190
seeing.

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.910
Well browsers will construct the document object model which basically means storing all the HTL tags

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.550
as javascript objects.

13
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.020
Let me show you a very simple example of this imagine I have some very basic H-2.

14
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.310
Over here on the left hand side I have a head a title which is just my title in in the body.

15
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.410
I have a heading 1 and then an anchor tag.

16
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.060
Web Site Link and then right below that on the left hand side is what this would look like in the browser

17
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.060
it would just be a heading and then some link text there.

18
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.370
When I upload this in my browser what happens is my browser creates this document object model and I

19
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.500
can already see how this looks like a javascript object so I have the element the aged him l the head

20
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.700
the title the text and I can actually grab things from the document object model using javascript so

21
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.430
we can see the DOMA or dom of any web site so you can go to Web site and in the consul type document

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.740
to see the actual document object model.

23
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.510
Now we're going to be doing that in this lecture later on and that will return the text of the page

24
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.950
to see the actual objects you want to use counsel that Diyar and then pasand document this document

25
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.070
object model will allow us to use javascript to actually interact with the web page and affect him and

26
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.070
see us on the web page.

27
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.730
Now keep in mind the document object model is enormous.

28
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.720
It has tons of properties it's a huge object but most developers won't use all the properties.

29
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.460
Not even close to all the properties.

30
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.390
But we're going to be covering the most common objects use and I want you to be prepared for the unknown.

31
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.020
When you first see the docking object model it's going to seem really intimidating and there's all these

32
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.080
properties and you'll feel like there's no way you'll ever have be able to memorize all of them.

33
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.570
And that's not really the point you don't have to memorize all of them.

34
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.820
We have to do is have an understanding of how it works that way.

35
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.300
When you need something that you haven't encountered yet you have the capability to reference it on

36
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540
your own and look for help on your own.

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.440
So let's continue we're actually exploring this idea in the browser and afterwards in the next lecture

38
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.470
we're going to go through an example of using javascript with the document object model.

39
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.840
So let me help over to my browser and kind of show you realistically what the heck I've been talking

40
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.640
about.

41
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.800
OK so here I am at Instagram dot com.

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.940
You can really choose any web site for this exercise or this example.

43
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.650
And hopefully now you can kind of see based off just what Instagram looks like at this moment in time.

44
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.310
You probably already have the ability to mockup something that looks pretty similar to this just with

45
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.560
H TMLC SS and bootstrap.

46
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.860
You already know how to create forms how to create nav bars etc..

47
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.270
But let's continue on and talk about the actual thing we came here for which is the document object

48
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.770
model where you can do.

49
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.970
And you can do this on any page.

50
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.240
It has to be Instagram.

51
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.960
Right click then inspect and then come to the console.

52
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.900
And what you're going to do is show us clear the console.

53
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.770
You may have some messages here the website you're visiting but worry about them just clear the console

54
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640
and let's explore the document object model.

55
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.060
Now if I just type in the variable document and hit enter I will actually get as an output the time

56
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.400
else on this page so I can see here there's a body and I can keep expanding this to end up seeing some

57
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.250
scripts maybe I want to see these divs cetera.

58
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.590
Eventually I'll see the forms but that's not actually what I want to see.

59
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.690
What we want to see is this entire document so all the T.M. and its properties as a javascript object.

60
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:15.460
And to do that I can say console got DJR and then passen the document I enter and now we see document.

61
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.030
And if I expand it I get what looks like and basically is a javascript object or you have all these

62
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.300
various properties and their values.

63
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.000
And here I can actually then using javascript Rabbe properties from this web page and then edit their

64
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.990
values to actually create changes that appear to the user on the front end.

65
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And that's basically the idea behind the document object model.

66
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.200
This is what's going to allow you to use javascript to actually manipulate what the user sees on the

67
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.110
web page.

68
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.920
And this is going to be the big leap forward for us to end our understanding of how the front end actually

69
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.670
works.

70
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.500
So far we have all the puzzle pieces but we haven't really put them together the document object model

71
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.780
is what's going to allow us to put them all together and actually see how the front end fully collaborates

72
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.750
with javascript.

73
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.950
H.M.S. assess making that powerful front and stack really shine and really work OK.

74
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.360
So that's all I want to cover for this lecture and the next lecture we're actually going to show you

75
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.150
an example of how you can affect this document object model using javascript.

76
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.610
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
