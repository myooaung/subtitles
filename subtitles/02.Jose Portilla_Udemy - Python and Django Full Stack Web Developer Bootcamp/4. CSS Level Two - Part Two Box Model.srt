00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,070
Hello everyone and welcome back to part two of the Level 2 this lecture we're going to be discussing

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,190
and learning about the CSSA box model the box model allows us to precisely dictate how we want HVM l

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,440
elements to look on a page.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,740
So the basic box model looks something like this.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,210
You have your e-mail content that might be something like a paragraph of text within each T.M. then

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,450
in-between the paragraph or whatever HVM content you have and the border you have padding and remember

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,490
the border is something that actually played with performance C Ss that was things like a two pixel

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,110
dotted orange border around your content.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,430
So if you want more space between actual content and the border you have padding there.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,330
And then if you want some space between your border and other HTL content within their own box model

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,120
there's a margin you can specify beyond that order.

12
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,650
So each of these padding border and margin elements have a space that you can define.

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,220
That way you can space out your elements exactly how you want them to look and you just specify each

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,010
side to just beyond padding border and margin.

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,710
You can actually specify left the right bottom etc. to have even more flexibility and control over the

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,220
box model and your T.M. elements.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,910
Let's explore some examples of this by jumping to our editor in our browser OK.

18
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,050
So here my editor I have an HMO file open called Part Two box models.

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,910
It's linked here in my browser and then I also have it linked to a style sheet here that's blank right

20
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,620
now.

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,340
Let's add a little bit of content to this.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,120
Tim L5 to get started.

23
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:44,770
I'll add a Heading 1 elements and it will just be saying something like top and we'll give it the ID

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:57,820
top and then we'll add another Heading 1 and we'll call it bottom with the same ID.

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,760
So let's refresh this and see we have a top and bottom and now let's explore what happens when we adjust

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,260
the box model around these.

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,490
Remember the box small consists of the margin the border the padding and then the actual content.

28
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,120
So to make it clear what's actually going on.

29
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,510
Let's come back to the SS and then create a CSSA call for each of them for each of their IDs.

30
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,860
So that's top and bottom and we'll give each of them a border.

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,580
So the border for the first one let's have it be a four pixel solid blue border.

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:45,700
And for the bottom one we'll give it a border of four pixel solid red so save that refresh over here.

33
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,250
Now we can see now we have the actual borders around them.

34
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,610
So something that we can actually specify is the width of the border itself which we've experimented

35
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,870
a little bit by actually color pixels but we can do is the find with as a percentage so we can see right

36
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:09,100
now that this blue border here goes from essentially one end of the browser to the other.

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,350
And if I stretch this browser out as well you'll see that the Border continues to stretch along with

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,870
me stress in the browser which is good but sometimes you don't want it to go from ends and you want

39
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,020
to fine it based on some sort of percentage and you can do just that.

40
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:30,240
So if I want to find the with based off some percentage I can say 25 percent.

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,950
Now if I refresh this I can see we're going to tick up 25 percent of the width of the browser.

42
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:43,250
So as I expand this we can see we're expanding the blue browser as long as it takes up 25 percent of

43
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,210
the width of the actual page itself.

44
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,600
Now let's show you another thing we can do.

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,290
We've already seen text align bullets go ahead and show that if I say text the line center and refresh

46
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:03,570
this page I can see now my text is aligned to the center relative to the actual order.

47
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,200
Now let's imagine that I actually want to move this entire blue block around.

48
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,680
Well what do I have to change then we go back to our box model image which opened up here in a new tab.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,960
We see that it's really the margin that's going to define the space between the border and everything

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,530
else so right now if we come back here I have the contents some order and then the margin and in between

51
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,970
the content and the border is padding.

52
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,540
But what we really want to change here is this margin right here.

53
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,690
I want to center this entire blue border.

54
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,590
And one thing we can do is actually specify specifically margin.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,510
And then what I can say is the top right bottom and left pixels.

56
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,100
So we'll start off by showing you the pixels.

57
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,320
What happens if we say something like this 10 pixels on the top.

58
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Let me actually put this as a comment so you can remember the order it goes.

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,950
Top right bottom left.

60
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,180
The other way we could do this is by actually specifying something like margined dash left.

61
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:14,650
So we saw earlier an image that I was pacifically specify left right top bottom but you can just do

62
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,440
it all in one single margin call just by the spacing and there's actually no comma that goes in between.

63
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,950
So we'll have the top 10 pixels margin right.

64
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,470
The 20 pixels and let's say bottom is a lot.

65
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,150
We'll make it 100 pixels and left will make it 400 pixel or something just so we can get an idea of

66
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,420
the differences here and refresh this.

67
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,190
We can see here now we're actually defined in the margin based off of pixels where the width is still

68
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,880
defined to be 25 percent of the actual width of the page.

69
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,130
Now if I call auto here to the margin

70
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,840
save this and refresh notice that it will be auto centered.

71
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,730
So if you want something to be centered not just the textbook the actual block itself that box model

72
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,700
we can see that we can call auto here and right now I'm calling a with of 25 percent of the browser

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,590
page and the margin is auto that it's even on both sides.

74
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,270
Great.

75
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,870
Now let's mess around a little bit with this bottom call.

76
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:25,820
Let's specify that with to be 50 percent of the page and let's give it some padding and remember padding

77
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,710
is going to make space between the actual content and the border itself.

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,740
So keep in mind what you think is going to happen if I say something like padding 200 pixels here what

79
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,400
do you expect the shape to look like as far as the relationship between bottom and this red border.

80
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,080
Well let's find out.

81
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
Going to refresh.

82
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,160
And this is basically exactly what we hopefully expected.

83
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,620
Remember padding is the difference between the content itself and the border.

84
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,580
So if we come back here we see that we have the content the padding and then the border.

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,510
So what do I do if I want to maybe align this to the center while I just come back here and call text

86
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,350
align center refresh.

87
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,930
I can see now my text alignment has been centered.

88
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,900
OK so that is the basics of learning the box model first.

89
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:22,560
SS Really we just want to focus on those four things the actual content itself the padding the border

90
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,580
and then the margin.

91
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,430
Or remember the spacing that happens between all of them and the fact they can call top left right or

92
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,200
bottom for each of those things OK.

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,220
Coming up next is going to be an explanation of a project that will really help hone in on these ideas.

94
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,770
I know we just really briefly covered it in the lecture but the next project is really designed for

95
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,910
you to kind of discover these things on your own.

96
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,980
And then the next section will be discussing Bootstrap which is going to help automate a lot of these

97
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,380
things so you don't have to worry every time by adding a new element what the border is what the with

98
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,770
is what the margin is etc..

99
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,420
A lot of that stuff is going to be taken care of when we begin to use bootstrap.

100
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,340
But for now we want to make sure that you understand if you had to go in and manually edit the assess

101
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,950
that you're able to do that with the box model.

102
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,530
So again box model maintains to get out that if you need to adjust your content you have the padding

103
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,700
border and margin all to play around with to get stuff to look exactly like you want it to.

104
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,240
And you can define things in percent or in pixel and then you can align things to be auto as well.

105
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,940
All right thanks everyone.

106
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,750
I'll see you at the next lecture we're going to explain that project to you and how it's really going

107
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,960
to help you understand the box model and it's also a font aspect to it as well.

108
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,390
Thanks.

109
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,460
I'll see you at the next lecture.
