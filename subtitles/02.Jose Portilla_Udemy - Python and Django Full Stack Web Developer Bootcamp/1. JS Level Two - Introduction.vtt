Hello everyone and welcome to javascript level to so far we've only really covered the basics of javascript

2
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.380
and now it's time to expand our understanding by learning a little more about advanced material.

3
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.570
And in this section we're going to be covering three main topics functions arrays and objects.

4
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.570
Functions are going to allow us to reuse or code arrays or a data structure that will allow us to store

5
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.700
data sequentially and then we'll learn about objects which will allow us to store data with key value

6
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.510
pairs.

7
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.380
Three really important topics.

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.080
And we'll also have exercises for each of these topics for plenty of practice by just learning these

9
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.670
three additional topics we're really going to be able to expand our capabilities of javascript on the

10
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.720
front end.

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.510
OK.

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.360
I hope you're excited.

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.390
So let's get started.

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.590
I'll see at the next lecture.
