1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,760
Welcome everyone to Part 11 of the social club project before we can begin debugging we have to add

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,070
in views for leaving and joining groups.

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,170
We kind of left those views untouched and now we're going to add them in it's going to be too class

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,350
based views and then we're going to connect them to the Urals not py file inside of the group's application.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,520
Once we've done that we should be ready to go for debugging and testing.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,340
The reason we have to do this before we actually jump straight into debugging is that we'll get a lot

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,760
of errors because instead of a lot of our templates we're actually calling groups join in groups leave

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,940
for those actual buttons and we need some sort of view to at least connect them.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,750
Let's hop over to the editor and finish that up.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,250
All right here we have the views the PI file for groups application and we help create group single

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,130
group and list groups and I'm going to create two more class based views.

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,720
And that's going to be a joint group I'll pass there for now.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,850
And a Leib group and they're gonna look really similar.

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,050
Just one is going to be for leaving a group and another one's going to be for joining a group.

15
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,550
Let's start with join group.

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,500
First off to join a group should be logged in so will have log in required Mixon and we're going to

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,070
use another generic class based view.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,750
And that one's going to be a redirect for you.

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,820
So once someone clicks on join we should do some stuff on the back and for models to join the actual

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,710
user to be a member of that group and then we're going to redirect to another page so that we can do

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:40,150
here is say if there's a method we can define called Get redirect you are el.

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:46,180
And that will allow us to grab whatever we wanted direct them to.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,710
Once they join it group will say self arcsin keyword arguments and we're going to return a reverse call.

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,600
So in order to use reverse make sure you scroll up here and actually import it it's right here under

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,870
your own resolver so we're good to go.

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,110
The only collapse that directory tree get a little more room here and there we're going to redirect

27
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,740
to groups single.

28
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,740
So that will be the detail view of that particular group.

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,370
Now in order to know what groups we're talking about we're going to add in a keyword arguments dictionary

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:25,790
and it's just going to define slug as self keyword arguments lips self cured arguments get slug.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,530
Essentially you just get whatever slug of the page or clicking button that you're on the group of.

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,640
And that's all you need to do forget redirect you are all and know what we can do is add in some more

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:45,740
checks in case this person is already a member of the group so you can say the F gets and they will

34
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:59,730
be self request and that takes an args and keyword arguments and a well-defined group as object.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,200
In fact we're going to need to import this was a good object or for or for which either means try to

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,940
get the group that this person is currently looking at or return a four or four page.

37
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:17,830
So in order to use this command we're going to scroll back up and then we'll say from jingo shortcuts

38
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,130
import objects or four or four.

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,570
And you also notice there's a get list option but we're just looking for a single object so just say

40
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,180
group and then we will say group is what we want.

41
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:37,790
So then we're going to add in a couple more things we will say group slug and slug is going to be able

42
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:44,470
to self keyword arguments get slug

43
00:03:47,420 --> 00:04:02,850
and then we're going to try we will say group member objects creates user is equal to self request user

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,570
work group is equal to a group.

45
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,110
All right so what does that actually mean.

46
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,810
I'm going to try to get the group member objects and create one where the user is equal to the current

47
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,460
user and group to group.

48
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:26,180
So creating a number and then I will have an accept accept and I can actually accept a specific error.

49
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,680
So the specific error we're looking for is an integrity error.

50
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,680
Well you don't have to technically you can just say except you don't have that right in the air here.

51
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,190
So it can say integrity air.

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,980
And then we will say messages warning and in order to use messages you're actually going to need to

53
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:52,930
import it so let's scroll back to the top and say from Jingo that contrib import messages these are

54
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,730
basically things we can send back to the user.

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,940
So say from lips from Jingo that contrib import messages so we can send the message hey you're already

56
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,710
a member of that group.

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,110
If you're trying to join it again and then say itself the request and then we actually pass and what

58
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:19,690
we want to warn here so we can say warning already a member so that will be if they're already a member

59
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,440
we'll get some sort of error there.

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:33,010
Else we're going to say is messages success Noll's say self-taught requests and then say is a second

61
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,150
crap.

62
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,070
This is not supposed to be an equal sign neither is this supposed to pass in the self.

63
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:47,580
And then here we're going to say as a second argument you are now a member.

64
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,190
We actually don't need these princes here.

65
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,640
It's just the second argument.

66
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,540
OK.

67
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,980
So that should be it for that.

68
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:04,730
And then at the end of all this get we're going to return calls super gets request arcs and then he

69
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,690
word arguments and then save that.

70
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,590
So we're doing here is if you're joining a group we have this redirect you are ill from this a view

71
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,200
that just says OK once you join the group go back to that group's single detail page and then for this

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,210
we want to make sure that a person is going to receive some sort of error or warning message if they're

73
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,890
already inside the group and a good way to do that is by using jingoes built in messages from contrib.

74
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,870
So using that you can just try to do what we would do which is grab a group member object and create

75
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:43,230
it with the user equal to the current user and group equal to group which we just said Get object or

76
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,620
create.

77
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,970
So that's where groups coming from.

78
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,240
So this group right here is linked to this group right here on line 29 and then we can say except integrity

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,550
air.

80
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,980
And you can just actually say except So if there's any sort of air you could just say for instance this.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,010
That's totally fine as well say that they were going to send some warning message says hey you're already

82
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,780
a member.

83
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,620
Otherwise if it works we'll say you're now a member and then we're just going to return super get requests

84
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:15,750
and then Arkes and keyword arguments then we're going to fix this for LIBOR and actually be pretty similar.

85
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,250
So for lebe group we're going to again say you should be log in to leave a group and we'll also have

86
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,540
a generic redirector view.

87
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,740
So once you leave a group you should be directed somewhere.

88
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,880
So I'll say in fact this will just make it the exact same thing.

89
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,470
Once you leave a group you get redirected to that group's page.

90
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,240
You can also make it redirect to the home page if you want it to or the grouplets page but we'll keep

91
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,810
things simple and experiment and Titian's right there is.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,200
So again pretty much the exact same thing when you leave a group you'll be redirected to that group's

93
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,090
detail page.

94
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,720
And then finally we'll have a get method very similar to the one we just made.

95
00:07:51,780 --> 00:08:01,780
So it's going to be self request arx keyword arguments to make sure that they can't accidentally leave

96
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,670
a group that are not really in it.

97
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:10,780
So we're going to do is first try we will try to get a object we'll call it membership and set that

98
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,760
equal to models group member and they'll be objects and I'm going to filter those objects.

99
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:29,650
And we will filter only start this new line user is equal to self request user and then group underscore

100
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:41,780
underscore underscore underscore slug Ziegel to self-taught keyword arguments get slug and then off

101
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,190
all that we're going to just call get method.

102
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,610
So we're going to attempt to try to get a membership and that's all that group member assuming that

103
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,610
the user is already in that group.

104
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,620
So grab the group slug grab the user off that group member object and that's going to be my little membership

105
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:05,700
that are going to be playing around with and then I'm going to be except now I can say models group

106
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,610
member does not exist.

107
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,550
That's an actual thing I can call off that group member object.

108
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,660
So if that thing does happen to actually exist it means that group member was never actually a member

109
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,300
of that group.

110
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,350
So you excellently click delete button on a group you were never a member of to say messages warning

111
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,930
self-taught request.

112
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:36,830
Basically same thing we're doing last time and says Sorry you are in this group and let's say you are

113
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,900
not so don't have to worry about syntax for single quotes.

114
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,090
OK so sorry you are in the group.

115
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,730
Else we're going to do is if everything's working we'll say membership and we can call a delete method

116
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:57,580
off of this and then we're going to say messages and call a success message and then pasand the request

117
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:12,070
request and says you have left the group then I'm going to return super gets passen request person or

118
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,180
X and then person keyword arguments.

119
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,680
OK so that should be looking good.

120
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,850
I'm going to save this and the next thing I want to do is make sure I actually connect these views to

121
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,430
my your stop PI file.

122
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,810
So let's open that up.

123
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,790
Else that pie inside of groups we have a couple of more views to do so we'll come over and we'll add

124
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,940
in the leave and join view to the left profile we'll say you're all

125
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,150
join forward slash and we will say we're actually going to just grab and copy and paste the same thing

126
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,570
here.

127
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,080
Join and then we will say views.

128
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,990
Join a group and call that as a view and give that the name join since that's what we did in the templates.

129
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,270
And then the other thing we're going to do is add in the leave.

130
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,770
So let me just copy and paste this into the same thing.

131
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,930
Copy paste instead of join.

132
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,620
It's going to say leave and sort of join group.

133
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,500
It will be great.

134
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:24,660
And then set the name join it will be leave so we're going to save that and that's it for the join and

135
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,620
leave views that we had to create.

136
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,030
So again over and views.

137
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,410
He's definitely more complicated views so we kind of waited till now for joining a group and leaving

138
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:34,930
group.

139
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,330
They're really really similar.

140
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,630
They're both read direct views.

141
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,260
Meaning you just kind of define OK what's this person's perform this action.

142
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,470
Where should they go to.

143
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,210
And that's the redirect view and I can actually pass keyword arguments and grab things off that current

144
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,330
requests such as the slug that they're looking at to go to that detail page and then we have to get

145
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:00,780
methods both in leave and join group and basically what these do is check to see if the user can actually

146
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,360
perform the given action.

147
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,240
If he didn't have these try except.

148
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,340
Else calls here.

149
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:12,150
You may just get broken pages if the person wasn't in the group and then try to join it and then try

150
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,450
to join it again etc. instead of doing all that they can just have these messages show up and that will

151
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,920
help fix any issues.

152
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,650
OK so that's it.

153
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,090
We should now be ready to take care of a few more things in settings that pi connect everything and

154
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,190
start the bugginess.

155
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,060
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
