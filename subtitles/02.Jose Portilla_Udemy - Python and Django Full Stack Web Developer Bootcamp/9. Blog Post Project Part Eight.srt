00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,600
Hello everyone and welcome back to part 8 of the blog clone project.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,120
So now we're going to continue on by filling out the rest of the templates.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,340
Let's hop over to the editor and get started.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:16,910
OK.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,610
Here I am at the editor.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,780
I have the base studies team l file open here and what I'm going to be doing is opening up the rest

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,730
of these team files and I can double click on them to open them up in new tabs I'm going to do that

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,240
and then and basically all of these what we're gonna be doing is extending from the blog base raised

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,600
him L. so have already here in the About page so it's collapses directory tree and put the Slyne in

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,950
all of these since we're going to be sending from baseline T.M. for all of these.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,200
And we see as files so we don't need to put it there.

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,830
OK.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,490
So let's start off with probably the simplest page is going to be our About page.

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,260
So in this about page is just an empty template and you can really put whatever you want here but we're

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,470
going to add in a call to the content block.

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:15,350
So say content and then we're going to end that block say and the block and then here you can just put

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,130
whatever you want.

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,230
Just keep things simple.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,130
We'll have an H1 heading and I will say about this company.

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,570
Or you can say about me the pending.

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,290
That's a personal blog and then I'll say thanks for checking it out and maybe you could put in a Jumbotron

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:40,210
a thing etc. but we're going to do is copy and paste this real quick and grab this block call and LME

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,730
delete the end block.

24
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,640
And I'm also going to pace that into all the rest the aged him else to set up the actual blocks.

25
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,010
So we'll do that as well.

26
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,520
Wups and that's because we're going to be using that in essentially every single page him Al file since

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,860
that includes the nav bar itself.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,770
So we'll do that and all of these.

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,660
OK.

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,910
So let me go across the board and save these and the next one I'm going to work on is post list.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,100
Remember post lists is just the list the view that lists all the posts so it should be pretty simple

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,990
to work with.

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,510
We're going to do is after calling block content I'm going to create a DIV tag here called center stage

34
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,790
and that's going to allow me to kind of center these a little more.

35
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:34,840
And so over here and blog about C Ss I will create something as a new class called center stage where

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:44,010
anything inside this center stage I'll call margin left to be auto to center it as well as margin right.

37
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,070
And you could also just call it margin auto but this kind of just to make it a little more clear what

38
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,400
center stage is about.

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,890
And hopefully the name is also pretty clear but will have that this isn't necessary you don't need to

40
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,340
do that.

41
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,430
We'll just kind of be offset if you don't.

42
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,530
And we're going to do is have a for loop with Django template.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,280
So say for post in or remember the default is post list whenever you were a fatalist view.

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,140
It's that name of that model underscore list and then when you have the four you've got to have the.

45
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:21,580
And the four and then we're going to do is let's create another div and we'll have this be the class

46
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:28,420
post in case we ever want to do anything with it and we'll say H-1 have a link here.

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,730
And this is going to be a moral effect let's make sure that template tag Yoro and Ill take us to the

48
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,160
post detail.

49
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:47,970
Page with the piquet primary key equal to post-up piquet and essentially it is going to do is add in

50
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,570
the temple injection here of post-Idol.

51
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,180
And this says OK if you are able to click on that post-Idol since it's an anchor tag it's going to take

52
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,810
you to that post detail where the primary key of that post detail is equal to postop Piquet or post

53
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,240
is being returned for Postum post list.

54
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,270
And then after that let's create another div and we'll give this the date class we may or may not use

55
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:22,260
it just kind of keeping us organized here and then we'll have a paragraph that says published on and

56
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,700
then we're going to have the date.

57
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,330
So I'll say post the published and then I'm going to use some template filters and remember that's basically

58
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,990
string functions or date time functions that are from Python and you can use them with template injections

59
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,970
and I'd like to use date just for some formatting here so I'll say a capital D space am y.

60
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,830
And note the spacing here you sometimes get errors if everything here isn't touching together.

61
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,350
So there's no spaces here.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:03,010
And then finally what I can do is after that div I'll create one more anchor tag that links to the comments

63
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:15,830
so I'll say here you are I'll post underscore detail Piquet is equal to postop Piquet's to the exact

64
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,260
same thing wrote there and then I'm going to say have some comments.

65
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,230
Leps comments.

66
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:37,000
And then what I'm going to do is inject the comic counts so I'll say post approve underscore comments

67
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,900
and then what I can call for that is the kind of count attribute or count method.

68
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,640
So if you go back to the blog post wups page.

69
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,840
Basically what this is saying is if I were to click where it says comments won or comments too it would

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,630
take me back to that post detail page.

71
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,690
Just like clicking the title would which kind of make sense because if I click on comments I probably

72
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,460
want to see the detail page that actually has the list of those comments and that's it for the post

73
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,350
list page.

74
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,800
And this is essentially our home page for the Web site.

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,450
So we're all done with this now.

76
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,330
So let's go ahead and pretend someone clicked on it which would bring him over to the post detail page.

77
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,980
And this is going to be from a detail view.

78
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,940
So let's get started on this one.

79
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,330
So we're going to be probably one of the more complicated views or at least the view that has a lot

80
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,730
of content with it.

81
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:33,410
So we're going to create inside of this block in H-1 tag and we'll give it the class we'll give it the

82
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:41,460
class equal to will say post-Idol and then we'll say lower here.

83
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,640
So remember Lowder is that coloring class Sophie come back then here.

84
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,850
Lowder That way the actual colors change and we'll show later on a kind of a quick fix to get everything

85
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,210
to change color especially the highlighting which is essentially just coming back to the baseline each

86
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,040
symbol.

87
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:04,560
And over here you go to body you can just call class and then say loader here which is going to add

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,730
a lot more coloring effects.

89
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,930
Now be careful of this because you don't want to set everything to have like the background color.

90
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,580
So make sure this is set to color OK.

91
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,730
Coming back to the post the page after doing those changes.

92
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:27,950
What I'm going to do is have the heading 1 be the title of the post and then what I'm going to do is

93
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:36,370
have an if statement that says if the Post published date

94
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:46,410
I will say else and then I'll have an end.

95
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,820
Just to kind of set up my logic.

96
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,420
OK so what are we going to do if the Post published they meaning there's some sort of publication.

97
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,350
Then I'll create some sort of class here.

98
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,520
Pasand day the post day and then I'm going to inject the postop published date

99
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,790
else which means it's not published or going to do is say.

100
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,850
Else.

101
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,370
And have a button here.

102
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,150
So this button is going to be.

103
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,620
We'll give it a class.

104
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,890
So it looks nicer.

105
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,480
We'll say between beats and the fall.

106
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,170
Just one of those bootstrap classes and what it's going to link to is a button that asks you oh you

107
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:40,230
want to publish this or not because it does have a published date meaning that it passes if test it

108
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,310
hasn't been published yet.

109
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,860
So we're going to do is if you click on that publish button I'll take it to you or El to the Post

110
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,830
publish where your primary key is the post-primary key.

111
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,780
There we have it.

112
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,870
And then we're going to end this.

113
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,260
So let's save that.

114
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,670
And then after that once that little post-Idol is done or you have the publish button all we're gonna

115
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:14,240
do is add in a paragraph here with the class equal to post content and we'll be adding these classes

116
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,220
to the C S S file later on.

117
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,350
Some of them we won't use some of them we will.

118
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,190
I always think it's a good idea to add in more classes than you may need.

119
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,500
And then once you fill that CSSA and your website looks good you can then go Ramoo classes but it's

120
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,460
really helpful for organizations have these classes here whether or not you're going to use them right

121
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,980
away.

122
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:40,240
And what's going to be here is going to have the post title and then we're going to have a safe on it.

123
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,340
And basically what safe does is since we're going to be using that medium javascript editor if we select

124
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,240
something as bold we won't want it to show up.

125
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,960
For instance in the Web site looking like this like oh bold text with the tags.

126
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,710
So if I don't have safe here and I've affected it using the medium editor it's going to look like this

127
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:07,140
included the tags if I have save that it's going to translate that is T.M. to actually look like we

128
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,820
expect it to look.

129
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,020
And if that doesn't really make sense you can basically just take off safe here and they'll immediately

130
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,490
make sense as far as what I'm trying to convey.

131
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:25,340
And then we're going to do is call one more says line breaks B.R. which essentially there's a line break.

132
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,280
The team Elbel so-called break there.

133
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,610
And then we're going to have another statement that's going to check that the user's authenticator not

134
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,080
souls.

135
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,570
If user is authenticated we're going to do some stuff.

136
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:46,210
But as always if you've got to END-IF so to create some new lines here.

137
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,910
So these are authenticated.

138
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,270
We should probably have something or let's say a two buttons one to edit the post in one to remove the

139
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,950
post.

140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,130
So the first line is going to be an anchor tag and we'll give it a class

141
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,480
and the class is going to be a primary button.

142
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,170
So say between space between primary

143
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,130
and then we'll your L posts underscore it will pass and the primary key is equal to the post-primary

144
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,730
keygen.

145
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:26,410
Just as we them before and then we're also going to inserts inside of this icon.

146
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,840
So let's do that.

147
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,630
We'll use a span tag for that will say span and we just have to give it a class.

148
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,430
So the class we're going to say is this glyph icon or Cliffie Econ. the penny how you pronounce it.

149
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,410
And then another glyph icon

150
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,970
Pensil.

151
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,910
So that's going to look like a little pencil.

152
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,770
So in case you want to actually edit the post you click on the pencil icon then I'm going to copy this

153
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,120
and let's do another one for removing the post.

154
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:07,610
So instead of it it will take you to post remove and then instead of a pencil glyph icon sort of we're

155
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,690
going to just say remove which is a little X..

156
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,090
OK.

157
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
So that's all we need to do there.

158
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,150
Let's continue on song.

159
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,960
Kind of a separator here.

160
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,060
I'll say actually you can do a horizontal break there.

161
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,260
Or horizontal row and then we're going to say is have a class here and let's have a button that allows

162
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,000
us to add comments.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:48,010
So I'll say this is an H ref that takes it to your L that is add comment to post with the primary key

164
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,450
being equal to the post-primary key.

165
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,100
Let's actually get the bootstrap class.

166
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,330
It looks nice.

167
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,770
We can say something like between beats and primary wups

168
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,150
PTEN comments.

169
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,280
So if we ever want to do stuff we can add it to that and then coming over to the right we have add comments.

170
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,320
Post and let's have some actual something in this link that says like add comments.

171
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,110
So we'll save that and then I'm going to put everything else here inside of a container class.

172
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,080
Everything that's left and basically inside this container is going to be the list of the comments.

173
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,680
So I'll say for comments in postop comments.

174
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,830
All and because I have this I want to and for.

175
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:53,460
So it's now well say and for and that after that we're going to do is absolutely close that in we're

176
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,010
going to end up doing is saying this.

177
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,810
So for every comma and post-doc comments I'm going to add in the break that we've got a little bit of

178
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:06,020
space and then another check of the user's authenticated or at the comma is an approved comment.

179
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,250
Otherwise I don't really want to display it.

180
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,040
So I'm going to say if the user is authenticated

181
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:24,300
or the comments isn't approved comments going back with that model and since I have an if statement

182
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,080
it's a good idea to just take care of the END-IF right now.

183
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,540
I'm going to pass in the comments created day so let's inject that in a comment.

184
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:48,210
Created underscore dates and they want to do is say if nots comments prove prove underscore comments

185
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,980
all have two buttons here.

186
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,270
One to remove the comment and then one to approve the comment.

187
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,440
This is going to be really similar to what I have here.

188
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,760
So it's going to copy and paste these

189
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,670
and let's line these up.

190
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,400
So I need to add this.

191
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,790
So here at the end this tab these and so they look a little more clear.

192
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,790
And I like to paste isn't.

193
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,840
So let me give this one more here and it's copy and paste this one more time.

194
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:29,840
And then here will have remove but instead of a post remove it's going to be a comments remove and a

195
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,890
sort of a poster to move here or actually you can just say this is comments or move instead.

196
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,200
So at the top on the comment remove So comment remove Piquet is the comments

197
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,870
primary key and then this Spanish class will just have it be removed so that stays the same and we can

198
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,180
have this being said of a primary button the default button and then the second one is going to be in

199
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,750
approval.

200
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:07,200
So instead of saying Kamens remove all change it common to prove so common to prove and the piquet does

201
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,850
need to be.

202
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,480
Comments.

203
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:15,030
Piquet's well and then the other one is going to have to be Cliffie Khan and you can really choose any

204
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,140
clip icons you want but we'll just say OK.

205
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,770
All right.

206
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,110
So a little if statement to kind of check everything's OK as far as what buttons we show.

207
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,600
And then below that I'm going to actually add in the information with some paragraph tags where I will

208
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,740
say put in the actual text of the comments.

209
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:46,690
Pass it through Safe case to use any special T.M. and then say line breaks so that we actually take

210
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:53,710
care of new line breaks and below that we'll add in one more paragraph tag or this paragraph tag is

211
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,910
going to say who is posted by.

212
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,170
So I posted my.

213
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:06,830
And then going to inject the comments author and we can passen as bold if we want but that's it.

214
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:13,030
And then what we can do is in between this and if this and for have a template tag to check if something's

215
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,020
empty meaning if there was nothing in the post comments at all.

216
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,380
We'll just say ok.

217
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,340
Empty.

218
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:28,010
And then it's a nice easy tag call for if this is empty what you can post in this case will say no comments.

219
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,400
OK so this was definitely one of the most complicated views we had to do throughout the entire project

220
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,050
so let's quickly go over it.

221
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,160
And if you want to actually reference any of this I'd highly recommend the kind of just copy and paste

222
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,180
from the notes provided to make sure everything matches because there's a lot of stuff we could have

223
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,590
possibly gone wrong here.

224
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,350
But essentially all we're doing is we're saying OK put in the post title if the Post has a publication

225
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,090
date.

226
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,290
Start the post date and then actually place it the publication date.

227
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,570
Else we're going to have a button here that says hey do you want to publish this.

228
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,640
And they'll take it to the Post publish page after that you have the actual post content which you start

229
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,230
off with just the post title.

230
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,530
Make sure it's safe and then have the line breaks if these are authenticated.

231
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,360
There are going to be able to edit the post or remove the post.

232
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,580
So that's what this block of code is doing.

233
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,610
Below that we're going to be able to add comments to the post.

234
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,170
And in this case we have this container for all the comments that are released to that post because

235
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,820
we are postop.

236
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,560
OK.

237
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,410
If the user is authenticated or the comments and approved comments we're going to show the creation

238
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:30,980
date.

239
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,870
If the comma is not an approved comment so I'm logged then I should still be able to see these comments

240
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,580
but they're not approved.

241
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,600
I can either remove the comments or give it the OK that it's been approved.

242
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,930
And then once that's done we're going to show the common text safe with line breaks and then show who

243
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,010
actually posted that comment.

244
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,590
So that's actually all this post the tail is doing.

245
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,610
So lots of code.

246
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,550
But the idea is pretty straightforward.

247
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,590
OK.

248
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,260
We'll continue on this in the next lecture.

249
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,900
We go the other templates.

250
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,270
Thanks and I'll see you there.
