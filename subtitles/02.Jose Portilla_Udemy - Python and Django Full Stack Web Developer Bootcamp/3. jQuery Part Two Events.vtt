00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.020
Hello everyone and welcome to part two.

2
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.600
Jake queery events and this lecturer are going to be using the same H-2 him I'll file from the previous

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.150
lecture.

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.270
We're also going to be connecting it to a jazz file where we'll be using a query to work with events.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.390
Let's get started by hopping over to the editor in the browser.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.050
OK so we have the Tim L file from the previous lecture open here on the editor as well as linked to

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.610
in the browser.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.730
Now we're going to be linking this to our own Javascript.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.970
So if we go all the way down here I've added a script tag with the source my script but Jesus just changed

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.080
that to whatever dodgiest you have in the same directory as this HVM I'll file.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.890
Here's the empty that Jesus.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.130
And let's show you some basic event handling with Jake Query.

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.590
First let's talk about clicks.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.620
Imagine you want to have the heading one here change when you click on it.

15
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.510
Well you can do is say something like H-1 and then you have the event call.

16
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.910
So that can be something like click and I going show you a link later on actually have it here open

17
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.070
in my browser with all the different type of event methods you can call using a query.

18
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280
There are a ton of them available to you.

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130
We're going to be going over the most basic ones and the most useful ones.

20
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.090
So that click is definitely one of those.

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.490
And inside of this is where you pass in your function.

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.350
They want to have executed when something it's clicked specifically having one element here.

23
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.170
So we're going to let's just say we logged something first so there was a click we will save that and

24
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.120
let's refresh this page and open up our console so we can actually see the log or me expand this a little

25
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.530
bit.

26
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.050
Here's a con. And I'm going to click on H-1 and I see there was a click.

27
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.420
Perfect.

28
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.460
So it's all working out.

29
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.930
Now let's expand on this idea.

30
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.800
Actually grabbing multiple elements.

31
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.070
So there's only one heading one but what if I pass an ally.

32
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.530
Well this is actually going to basically work automatically thanks to a query where if I say cancel

33
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.910
that log any ally was clicked.

34
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.090
Saved this.

35
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.830
I refresh this page and click on any line item.

36
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.860
You can see here that keeps getting repeated.

37
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.750
Perfect.

38
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.950
Now if you actually want to call methods or properties off whatever specific variable you're interacting

39
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.920
with here you have to use the this keyword.

40
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.370
Now let me show you an example of what that would look like.

41
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.770
Imagine that I want to change the heading every time I click on it.

42
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.540
Well what you can end up doing is you call dollar sign and imprint sees you pass in the this keyword

43
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.620
and inside of an event call like this that this keyword is referring to whatever object you are currently

44
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.420
performing that event on.

45
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.700
So we have this and then the offer that you can call it just like the variables we saw in the previous

46
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.150
lectures.

47
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.650
If I want to change the text I just grab text and then say I was changed so I'll save that.

48
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.070
And let's close this for now and refresh the page.

49
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.850
I'm going to click on heading one here and we can see I was changed so again with Jake Query.

50
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.480
You kind of have this funky keyboard with this but also in combination with the dollar sign.

51
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.950
So if we have any event call instead of the function we want to actually affect what's going on here

52
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.290
we have the dollar sign this and then dot in any of the previous methods we saw from the previous lecture.

53
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.110
Okay.

54
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.640
So that's the basics of clicks and there's also things like double clicks hover over mouseover.

55
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.930
There's a lot of stuff like that.

56
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.740
And if you want the complete reference they're all here and category events.

57
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.170
For instance let's say we're looking for DoubleClick.

58
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.210
Well it can expand this Z-Man.

59
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.450
Let's say I'm looking for something to do if click or double click while I can start typing click.

60
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.810
I see the event handler for click but I can keep searching and there I seen double click right below

61
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.880
it with DBIL click.

62
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.310
So that's what I would have to call that a click if I only wanted the event to listen for double click.

63
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.080
All right.

64
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.330
Now for events we are not just limited to things like clicks or mouse overs with just our mouse we can

65
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.310
actually perform actions on our keyboard and that's known as a key press.

66
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.500
Let's walk through a few examples of interacting the key press using Jake Query.

67
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.800
I will use the dollar sign notation and grab the input tax.

68
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.670
If we scroll down here we see we have to impot tags the text box right here and then submit.

69
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.180
So I just want to grab the text one so I will say E Q 0 since it's the very first input that shows up

70
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.140
on the page.

71
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:05.490
And then I'm going to call a method he press on this and I will call a function to occur whenever I

72
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.590
press a key inside of that text box.

73
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:18.340
And what I'm going to have happen is I will change heading 3 I'm going to toggle it's class turn blue

74
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:28.470
and let's save that I'll refresh my browser over here and now we'll see what happens as I begin to type

75
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.050
in this box.

76
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.580
You can see that the toggle class is toggling this turn blue on and off so again what's happening here.

77
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.730
Well I'm grabbing all the input tags then indexing to grab the very first one is a text box and then

78
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.610
assigning a key press method to it where every time I press a key inside the text box this function

79
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.110
occurs in this function.

80
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.600
Rab's the heading three tags toggles their class to be turned blue OK.

81
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.170
Now we can actually grab an event object from this that has a ton of information.

82
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.980
Now let me show you how we can do that inside of this function.

83
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:15.040
I can input the special keyword events and I'm going to log this so I will say cancel dot log this event

84
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.330
and you can see that it's highlighted to indicate that it's keyword.

85
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.960
I'm going to refresh this page.

86
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:29.160
And as I type you'll notice I get a console log and this is known as an event object and this event

87
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.570
object has a ton of information on it which we're really not going to need to know.

88
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.450
But if you scroll all the way down there's a which property here and if we click on that we see that

89
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:48.520
which is equal to 97 and that corresponded with the letter a type B that I get a new object.

90
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.550
Open it up.

91
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.580
Click on a.

92
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.300
And we see we have 98 by type the letter C.

93
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.430
Open up the new event objects all the way down.

94
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.850
I see I have ninety nine so there are actual number codes for every key on your keyboard which makes

95
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:10.510
sense because maybe only one action to occur when I enter or press w or press an up and down arrow key

96
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.920
which means we can actually specify events dot which to grab a particular code.

97
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.050
So let's see that in action I'm going to say

98
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.490
event which

99
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.300
is equal to and I want to use the key code 13 which is the enter key.

100
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.700
I will change heading 3

101
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:58.520
Zuby toggle class turn blue and let's save this one to refresh the page.

102
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.880
And now we should see that as I type stuff.

103
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:07.100
Nothing really happens until I press enter which I know you can't see that the change occurs.

104
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.490
So right now I'm just pressing enter on my keyboard and the changes occurring for any other key press.

105
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.460
Nothing will happen.

106
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.260
And that's how you can use the event object to grab information.

107
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:23.080
And with key presses which will tell you a numeric code that corresponds to that key and you can just

108
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.290
Google online for the numerical codes specific reason your keyboard.

109
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.110
We're going to discuss two more things.

110
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.970
And one is the method and the next one it will be effects and animations.

111
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.220
But let's quickly show you what the method looks like.

112
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:47.150
The method essentially acts like event at event listener from vanilla Javascript.

113
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:58.020
So if I grab H-1 and say dot on I passen and events for instance let's passen double click

114
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.790
and then I pass in the function

115
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:15.990
and we can use a special this keyword to reference H-1 here I'll say this and we will toggle class to

116
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.350
be turned blue.

117
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.660
So it's happening here.

118
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:27.000
I'm saying on DoubleClick call this function and this references the H-1.

119
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:34.010
So if I refresh this page every time I double click on this it's going to toggle this on and off and

120
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.580
my highlighting is making it seem a little weird because when your height when you double click something

121
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.210
it also gets highlighted.

122
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.390
Hopefully you can see when I'm trying to convey here and you can practice this on your computer to get

123
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.450
a better idea of it.

124
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:46.710
All right.

125
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.940
So let's show one of my last example.

126
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.660
This is basically just like an event listener so I can say something like mouse enter.

127
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.760
Save this and this should actually be a lower Casey save that.

128
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:09.290
And refresh our page and you'll see here as I mouse hovers over it suddenly turns into blue.

129
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.020
And now I can talk with the class just by hovering off anon.

130
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:19.150
So now I can just have a single call with toggle class instead of the dual calls we saw back when I

131
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.720
was using vanilla javascript's OK.

132
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.380
Finally let's talk about events and animations.

133
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.120
Now you can go to API that J.

134
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.700
Queried dot com categories slash effects to get more information about this.

135
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:38.450
But basically you can have animations or effects occur.

136
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.530
We'll show you some very common ones.

137
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:49.150
I'm going to say input da e q and I'm going to grab the second input which we look back at the HDMI.

138
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.550
It's the submit button.

139
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.120
So I want something to happen when I click on submit.

140
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.130
So I will say on click

141
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.230
function

142
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.090
and then I'm going to grab everything in the container class.

143
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.430
Let's put this in quotes here.

144
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.460
So grab everything in that container class.

145
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:26.250
And say fade out and you can pass in a number here in milliseconds.

146
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.120
So I like to refresh this.

147
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:28.990
I hit submit.

148
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.740
Let's close this before I do that.

149
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.470
I'll eventually see everything fade out within 30 seconds.

150
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.040
So what is actually going on here.

151
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.730
Well this is just an animation that is available to update query.

152
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:49.390
And basically it just fade out and you pasan a number of milliseconds that you want the fadeout to take.

153
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:56.120
There are many many animations and effects available to you just to show you one more you can use slide

154
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.810
up.

155
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:57.920
I will save this.

156
00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.630
Let's refresh the page.

157
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:06.320
And as I click Submit I can see everything starts to get slide up or basically a white and in order

158
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.500
to get this back I just have to refresh.

159
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.330
OK.

160
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:17.370
So again there's a link in the notes or you can just go to a guide that just create icon slash category

161
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.970
such effects to get the full list of all the effects available to here.

162
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.690
We won't really be playing around these too much throughout the rest of the course but you may find

163
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:32.530
when you're dealing with your own web site it may be fun to add in your own animation using Jake Weary.

164
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.230
All right.

165
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.730
So go ahead and check out the notes if you want to review anything we covered here.

166
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:42.460
But hopefully you now realize that Shakeri makes your life really simple and a whole lot easier especially

167
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.870
in working with the DOM.

168
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.330
Coming up next we're going to have a Kinect for game project.

169
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.150
We're actually going to make a working a fully working front and Web site that has a Kinect for game

170
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.860
on it.

171
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.840
Thanks everyone and I'll see in the next lecture.
