00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.620
Hello everyone and welcome to part one of CSSA level one.

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.290
I just wanted to quickly point out in the section of the course the notes are divided up into parts

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.630
1 through 5 and then we have a final level one assessment.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.940
Each part consists of an eighth HTML file and a CSSA file.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.750
So for example you may have something like Part 1 that age html and then Part 1 underscore master that

6
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.270
CSC.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.910
So those two files are meant to go together and be linked together and you can refer to the contents

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.890
of the CSSA level one folder for more information.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.340
OK let's get started with Part 1 where we begin to discuss the very basics of CSSA and how we can link

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540
it to an aged female file going to jump to the Adam text editor to get started.

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.510
All right so here I have my editor open as well as my browser.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.750
I've created a new folder called CSSA level 1 and they have two files in it.

13
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.740
One that each T.M. and part 1 underscore mastered that C Ss and will be Typee encoding these out if

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.270
you want the completed versions.

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.730
Just check the CSSA level one folder from the download.

16
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.110
All right.

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.320
Moving along a quick note it's unusual to have a digit or a number inside the name of a CSSA reached

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.570
him.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.280
File.

20
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840
I'm just leaving them there so it's clear which ones match up with the course notes and parts.

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.030
But usually you wouldn't actually have a digit or number inside the name of an email or the SS file.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.280
So I just wanted to quickly note that lets start off by making a very basic ASML page and that will

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.610
show how we can link stuff in the CSSA file to it.

24
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.270
So right now I have hurt one that asked him open all h t m l and I'm going to collapse the directory.

25
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.000
Just control or command backslash there and we'll just make this called C Ss basics and the title will

26
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.720
save that and then in the body I'm going to have a heading in this heading is just going to say this

27
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.140
is the heading and will have a paragraph as well in the body and it's going to just say let's see a

28
00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.300
list and then let's just create an ordered list o l where each item has a list item tag line will have

29
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.020
item 1.

30
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.300
Now let's make two more items in this list.

31
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.530
Item 2 ally.

32
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.590
Enter there and then.

33
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.490
Item 3.

34
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.050
OK let's save that.

35
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.420
Refresh our browser over here.

36
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.990
Looks good.

37
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.320
I can zoom in a little bit so we can see it better.

38
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.040
Ok so I have the heading.

39
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.250
Let's see a list item one item to item 3 and lets on the bottom say a heading for.

40
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.070
This is adding for save that refresh.

41
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.200
Now we see at the bottom we have heading for perfect.

42
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.850
Now we want to learn how we can actually connect styles to this same old document.

43
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.790
And that is where the head portion of the HVM document comes into play.

44
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.110
What we need to do is use a special keyword tag called link you'll see as I begin to type it.

45
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.680
I can hit enter and I get a link here and by default it says the relationship of this link is a stylesheet

46
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.950
and then we have a Tref which is going to be the actual path to this CSSA file and in our case it's

47
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.960
called Part 1 underscore M. that C Ss and we can just use Part 1 underscore M. that CSSA.

48
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.970
If it was located somewhere else on my computer I'd have to type in the whole file path or make a reference

49
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.080
to the whole file path.

50
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.820
But these two files are in the same directory so I can just write part 1 underscore master that see

51
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.970
SS and I also want to make sure that I specify that it's a style sheet and then I click save here and

52
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.090
if I refresh I won't notice anything different but now my document is linked to my style sheet.

53
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.940
So let's jump to the style sheet.

54
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.740
The start see SS and get started.

55
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.570
First let's show the basics.

56
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.370
If I want to make a comment it's just a forward slash Asterix and then anything you type in between

57
00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.240
two of those so then another Asterix forward slash is a comment and just like we did of H Tim L I can

58
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.650
type some text so will say some text and that I can do control forward slash.

59
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.510
It automatically makes that into a comment so you can save yourself some time there.

60
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.400
That also works for a multi-line So if I have some text on multiple lines I can highlight all of this

61
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.700
control or command forward slash and it will automatically make that all into a comment and it's always

62
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.150
good to calmy your code.

63
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.510
If you come back to a later time.

64
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.730
Now let's discuss the general form of SS The general form look something like this.

65
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:44.440
You have some sort of selected tag then curly braces inside these curly braces are going to have some

66
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.850
property a colon and then some value for that property in a semi-colon.

67
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.390
So that's going to be the very basic format for a CSSA file.

68
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.140
I wanted to comment that out and actually show you an example of one.

69
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.970
So let's think of a selected tag.

70
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.460
If I look back to my H.T. mail file I know that I have H-1 as a possible tag.

71
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.280
So let's grab that tag by typing in H-1.

72
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.200
I put in curly brackets and I can zoom in here a little bit so it's a little clearer.

73
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.800
And then I want a property of H-1 and one of the first properties are going to be working with is the

74
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.600
color property and you can see here that as I begin to type stuff in the CSSA file.

75
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.400
Adam text editor is actually trying to help me out.

76
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.380
Like oh you want color you want columns.

77
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.920
Column count etc..

78
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.840
So we just want color so I can actually hit enter there and all begin.

79
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.190
Help me out here with this.

80
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.180
So I want color and then I can state the actual color I want in this case.

81
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.310
I want the color to be blue and then a semi-colon.

82
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.370
And you notice what happened as I was typing the color itself for instance purple it doesn't turn yellow

83
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.640
that syntax highlighting until it's a color that works.

84
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.690
Now there are actually a lot of colors that CSSA already knows just by their name things such as basic

85
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.140
colors like red green black orange purple etc. later on where you'll learn how to actually passen color

86
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.580
codes.

87
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.870
But right now we're going to keep things really simple and just make this blue.

88
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.880
So let's save this and see what happens when we refresh our page.

89
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.160
And now you notice that this is the heading.

90
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.170
Anything with the H-1 tag.

91
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.830
Now has the color blue.

92
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.130
And that's the very basic idea of how C Ss works.

93
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.930
So you just have whatever tag you want to effect in the female the property of that age T.M..

94
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.790
And then what you want to change the property to.

95
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.230
There are a ton of properties you can edit using CSSA connected to your HTML file.

96
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.010
One of the most basic ones so we've covered already is color and we're going to show you right now in

97
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:57.830
this lecture various ways to change the color using not just key words but also code such as in our

98
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.900
G-B code in our G-B code and a hex code and we'll discuss what those are in just a little bit.

99
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.840
But don't worry too much right now about having to memorize all the various properties that are available

100
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.170
to you as we go through CSSA level 1 and see esus level 2 you're going to begin to naturally stand what

101
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.340
properties you want to affect.

102
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.650
Using C Ss for this lecture.

103
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:24.970
All I want you to get out of it is the general format of CSX which is the tag name the curly braces

104
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.720
and then the property.

105
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.890
And what you want the property value to be and how to link CSSA to H.T. mail file and the different

106
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.140
ways to change color.

107
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.890
So we've already learned how to link the H.T. mail file member that was just this link tag.

108
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.160
We've already learned the basic method of CSSA which is this tag curly braces.

109
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.230
And then property value.

110
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.290
So let's continue to explore the different ways we can effect color.

111
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.960
So so far we learn that there are certain keywords very common colors are available for us if I make

112
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.140
this red save this refresh on my page.

113
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.250
Now this is the heading is read.

114
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.100
So let's explore some more of this.

115
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.710
I'm going to put another tag in.

116
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.450
So that's going to affect all elements of the tag.

117
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:10.790
I remember that's item one.

118
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:19.560
Item 2 an item 3 let's call color now let's make these green save it refresh over here.

119
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.810
Now I can see the item one item tonight.

120
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.560
Three are green but there are other ways to do colors.

121
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.790
You don't just have to use colored anes because maybe you want your own custom color a certain shade

122
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.600
of blue a certain shade of red etc. you can do.

123
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.930
RG codes.

124
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.680
Let's explore a little bit more about what R.G. be codes look like.

125
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:50.130
I take my browser and expand it and I go to Google then here in Google I can search for RSGB enter and

126
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:58.280
I get this RG color model and then I can also do RSGB picker and notice that some of the top links are

127
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.160
color pictures that will be three schools are to be color code charts.

128
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.880
Any of these will work just fine.

129
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:10.030
They can click on color picker that come basically here we have a what's known as a color picker ZF-I

130
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.650
zoom in a bit.

131
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.600
You may be familiar with something that looks like this.

132
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.650
Remember we actually saw our own colored picker back when we were working of HMO.

133
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.380
But here you just select whatever color you want based off what looks good to you visually and you can

134
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.420
get the actual R.G. B code and you can also get hex codes if we're going to talk about it just a little

135
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:28.910
bit.

136
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:36.940
But if you notice we go back to Google and just search for color picker than Google itself will actually

137
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.260
show you the values here.

138
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.880
So I like using Google's own color pictures just google searching for color picker actually brings R.G.

139
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.890
B and this hex code for you which we're going to discuss just a little bit.

140
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.060
But let's say I wanted a specific shade of green.

141
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.330
I saw the basic green we had but let's say I want kind of a more forest green a little darker.

142
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:02.170
So I come down here I pick the color I like and I know these color numbers right here.

143
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.060
This basically is a representation of how much red is in the color how much green is in the color and

144
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.220
how much blue is in the color.

145
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.700
That's why it's called r.g.

146
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.550
So I can come back here and in this RSGB I will put those numbers so it was eight to me back here 84

147
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.570
in one.

148
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.960
So eight's 84 and 1.

149
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.810
And notice once it's complete everything is now the same teal colors for syntax highlighting.

150
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:34.140
So I will save this come back here and refresh and might not be too noticeable on your screen but I

151
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.570
can see that this is a nice darker green.

152
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.590
And just to make it really obvious we'll come and choose a brighter colors so let's go from dark green

153
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.370
to maybe some bright orange to come back to color picker.

154
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.260
Play around with this.

155
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.820
Maybe choose this really bright orange over here.

156
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.850
That's 2 5 5 9 7 0.

157
00:10:52.890 --> 00:11:00.100
I'll copy that person in here to 5:5 red 97 green 0 blue.

158
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.590
I will save my CSSA file to save those changes.

159
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.360
Refresh.

160
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.990
Now I see the list items have definitely changed.

161
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.830
Item one item to item 3.

162
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:09.480
All right.

163
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.830
Let's explore two more methods of changing color.

164
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.200
So I will grab this.

165
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.940
Let's see a list which is or just a paragraph.

166
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:26.950
So I say P curly braces call the color property and now I want to show you how to use hex codes and

167
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:33.170
hex codes are basically just another way of displaying the color than an actual code value.

168
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.980
So let's make it into kind of a nice blue.

169
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.800
Hopefully these are showing up well on your screen.

170
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.190
So I like the shade of blue.

171
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.760
I copy and paste this hex code and make sure it has this hash tag symbol in front of it.

172
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:53.860
Paste it in here and then a semi-colon to save this and then I will come back here to see if this basic's

173
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.890
refresh.

174
00:11:54.890 --> 00:12:00.580
And now I see that the paragraph or anything of that paragraph tag has been changed to have a blue color

175
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.660
that specific blue that I chose.

176
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.210
So that's just another way of coding out a color you have.

177
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.240
RG B red green blue and yellow hex codes.

178
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.240
Finally I want to show you one last way and I will do it for heading for.

179
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:20.390
And it's really similar to R.G. B except it's R.G. B.A.A. and the difference between RSGB which is red

180
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:26.230
green blue and are G.P.A. which looks like this color.

181
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:36.640
And then it's going to have four inputs is that R.G. is just red green blue R-GA is red green blue and

182
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.040
a term called Alpha.

183
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.290
And if you've done any sort of data visualization before you'll be familiar with Alpha where the alpha

184
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:49.730
parameter is a number between 0 and 1 or 0 stands for fully transparent and one that stands for fully

185
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.600
opaque.

186
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:57.530
So you can think of that second or last a value that Alpha value is just clarifying how dark or how

187
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.590
transparent this color is.

188
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.380
So let's come back up here.

189
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.610
Choose these values the same values and then input.

190
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.930
Let's say 0.5 for our color.

191
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:15.740
So we'll save that come back to heading for refreshed so we can see here at 0.5 the orange is a little

192
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.530
lighter.

193
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:25.610
If I go all the way to 1 and I save this refresh here then I can see that I have basically the darkest

194
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.140
possible version of this.

195
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:34.070
RG B it's fully opaque and that should match up with the normal R.G. be so be with a or alpha being

196
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:43.240
one is the exact same thing as R.G. B and F I make this zero and say refresh that I can see that it's

197
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.460
fully transparent.

198
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.290
So I want to highlight it.

199
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.130
I can see it but with zero it's fully transparent.

200
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:54.730
So again our GPA really similar to our D-B except a this last term just defines how transparent it is

201
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.280
with 0 being fully transparent and one being fully opaque.

202
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.030
OK.

203
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.850
So that's it as far as this part one.

204
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:07.600
What we've learned so far is how to connect CSSA to each T.M. the general format for a CSSA select the

205
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.820
tag property value mechanism and then how we can affect colors throughout the course.

206
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.490
Probably the most common color method we're going to be using are hex codes.

207
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.390
And that's probably what you see most commonly these days.

208
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.900
You also see R.G. be quite a lot R-Ga..

209
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.420
It's not very common unless you're doing a very quick Web site so you just directly call a letter name

210
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.910
colors like red purple green etc. but for really quick jobs you may want to do that because it's much

211
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.200
easier but usually you see hex codes.

212
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.080
OK thanks everyone.

213
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.960
And if you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

214
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.050
I'll see you at the next lecture.
