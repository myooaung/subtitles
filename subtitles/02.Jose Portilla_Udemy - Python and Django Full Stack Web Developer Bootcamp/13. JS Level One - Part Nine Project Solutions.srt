00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,290
Hello everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,910
Hopefully already attempted the javascript level and project because in this lecture we'll be coding

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,580
through an example solution for it.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,340
OK I'm excited so let's get started by hopping over to the editor.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,760
OK.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,990
So here we have my editor open.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,430
I've linked the html file to my own script.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,000
My script is right now empty.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,380
So nothing's going on.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,370
When I refresh the page.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,490
So let's expand or editor at everything we need and then we'll test it out with the actual web site

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,090
page.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,090
So I'm going to zoom in just a little more so we can see everything clearly.

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,870
OK.

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:43,560
The first thing I need to do is have the four conditions that I'm going to be checking.

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,420
Remember those four conditions are this.

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,160
It's the name condition so I'm going to make variables for these.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,120
And the name condition will have that be NULL to start off with the name condition.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,690
Is this their first name.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,200
First letter of the first name matched the first letter of their last name and you can actually not

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,690
have them be null they can be anything because we're going to be reassigning these later on but I'm

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,470
going to make them null to be clear that they're nothing right now.

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,850
And if you want we can put some icons there the conditions so they have to be between 20 and 30 exclusive.

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,960
We also have the high condition that's going to be No.

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,890
And then we also finally have the same condition.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,730
So I will say var that condition is nil.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,500
OK so those are the four conditions that I'm checking for.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,620
But remember I'm actually going to need to at least ask some questions.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,050
So let's put those questions at the top and going to grab the first name.

30
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,510
It's going to be a prompt whoops.

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:55,650
Now what I wanted it prompts and I will ask first name please.

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,670
And you can basically write as much or as little as you want and then ask for the last name and I'm

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,680
going to.

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,640
Sorry about that.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,360
There it is prompt.

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,450
OK.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm going to ask for the last name please.

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,960
And then the next variable i want is age.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,740
So I'm going to ask how old are you.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,450
Questionmark

41
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,570
also on height.

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,050
So that's another promt.

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,460
So just a bunch of prompts so we ask the user when they reached a page.

44
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,620
What is your Height's question mark.

45
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,720
And then finally that name will ask for a prompt.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,620
What is your name questionmark.

47
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,930
So we have everything after all of that.

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,900
I'm just going to say it.

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,380
Thank you so much for the information.

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,910
And it doesn't matter a whole lot whether we define these four condition variables before or after this.

51
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,930
But I like the idea of grabbing all the variables that we need from the user first and then having all

52
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,440
our logic follow it.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,880
So we had those four conditions.

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,740
Let's start using control flow to actually check that these conditions are true or false.

55
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,960
So the first we need to check is the name condition remember the name.

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,010
Condition asks is the first letter of their first name and the first letter of their last name.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,530
The same thing.

58
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:44,890
So I'm going to say if first name index at zero is equal to last name index at zero set the name condition

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:54,920
to be equal to true else the name condition is going to be equal to false.

60
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,250
That's a quick and easy way we can check if their first letter of their first name matches the first

61
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,170
letter of their last name.

62
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,020
Now we want to check the age condition.

63
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,900
So how do we do that.

64
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,780
Well we want to say if age is greater than 20s or are we doing exclusive.

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:21,600
So I don't put that equal sign and ages less than 30 so we make sure not to over shoot this.

66
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,320
I will say that the age condition Zuko is a true else.

67
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,740
I know they didn't pass the age test.

68
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,570
Age condition is equal to false.

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,920
And hopefully now you can see why we could have assigned something else for the age condition we could

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,620
have assigned them all to be true or all to be false to begin with.

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,270
Moving along we have our age we have the first name check.

72
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,220
And now I want to check the height condition

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,000
so I will say if

74
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:06,050
it's is greater than or equal to 1 7 Remember it was at least 170 that I want my height condition.

75
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:17,170
I can see helping us out here to be true and just like the last time I'll say else I condition is equal

76
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,340
to false.

77
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,850
Pretty simple and pretty straightforward so far.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,050
And then last but not least I want to make sure that the pet name is ending with Y.

79
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,360
This was a little tricky because we haven't shown anything quite like this but hopefully you're able

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,490
to figure it out.

81
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:39,820
I'll see if the pet name and then somehow I want to grab the last letter of the pet names.

82
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,540
How do we actually do that.

83
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,470
Well we know how to grab the first letter which is just 0.

84
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,290
But if I want to grab the last letter I'm going to have to take into account that pet names can be of

85
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,700
different lengths and one way it can do that is by calling that name length.

86
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,860
So we might think that this gives us the very last letter but remember indexing starts at zero which

87
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,630
means I need to subtract one from this in order to make it work.

88
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,730
So you can imagine that if I had the pet name just be the letter A.

89
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,040
And I want to check the last letter of the string of a single letter.

90
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,560
I'd have to check 0 right.

91
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,530
So even if it has length of one I'd have to say one minus one to actually grab that last letter.

92
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,810
So that's just a quick explanation of why I have to do the minus one here.

93
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,620
That's because indexing starts at zero and if you don't believe me you can kind of check it out.

94
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:37,590
Play it yourself and I want to make sure this is equal to why and if that's the case then I know the

95
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,790
condition will be reassigned to true else.

96
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,680
I'll say that condition is equal to false great so have the pet name there and now I just want to check

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,380
if all four conditions are true.

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,310
So check all conditions

99
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,570
and what I'm going to do here say if the name condition is true.

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:20,820
Hans the age condition is true and the condition is true and the condition is true.

101
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:31,470
I'm going to log something like welcome's by else we can either not do anything or just say nothing

102
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,390
to see here.

103
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,530
And sometimes what confuses beginners is the fact that I'm just writing here the actual condition and

104
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:45,840
not saying something like name condition equals true and A's condition equals true etc..

105
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,020
Remember these are already booleans themselves so these conditions should already be booleans by the

106
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,750
time they get to this stage.

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,770
They're either all true or all false or some combination of true and false meaning I don't need actually

108
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,210
check.

109
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,900
Is Equal equal.

110
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,150
True because they're actually all conditional tricks.

111
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,560
So basically is going to be something like True and False and True and False or false false and false

112
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,070
are true or untrue etc..

113
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,330
Ok so you can always review the actual part 9 javascript if you want.

114
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,790
The written code for everything not just that here let's say this and actually test it out to make sure

115
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,920
it worked going to expand this.

116
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,580
We are going to refresh

117
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,320
and here we see first name please.

118
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:36,080
All input Jose last name will say John how old mine will say we are 27.

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,950
What is my height.

120
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,910
I'll say 180 centimeters.

121
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Pet name.

122
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,820
I'll say Franki for y.

123
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,450
Thanks so much for the information we Right-Click inspect.

124
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,820
Check the console and it says welcome by.

125
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,450
Let's make sure the inverse is true.

126
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,490
So I refresh this page first name.

127
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,990
Just going insert some garbage.

128
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,910
Last name some other garbage held in my amp.

129
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:04,440
12 years old will say were 120 centimeters and pet name is Alph.

130
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,880
Now it says nothing to see here Merfolk So it looks like our solution worked correctly.

131
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,030
OK if you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

132
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,860
But you are now complete with javascript.

133
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,590
Level 1.

134
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,130
It's time to move on to javascript level 2.

135
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,330
Thanks and I'll see it the next section of the course.
