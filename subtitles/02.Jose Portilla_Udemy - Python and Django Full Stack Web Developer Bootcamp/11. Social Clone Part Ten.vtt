00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.910
Hello everyone and welcome to the social cloning project part 10.

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
Now that we have our views for the Post's app and the Eurostar profile complete let's create the template

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.290
HTL files for the Post's pages.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.950
Once that is complete we can begin to debug in the next lecture.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.300
All right.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.540
Let's hop over to the editor and get started.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.850
All right so what I got ahead and done is under the Post's application or other templates under post

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.190
I have the html files so we created earlier in the section of the course.

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.180
Now we're going to do start off by editing post underscore Baystate HMO.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.110
This is the post based file.

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.620
So first we're going to extend from our initial base that each team which has the navigation bar.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.750
And we're going to do a really similar thing here just like we did with the group based its HTML file.

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.870
Let's create a block and this block is going to be called content.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.490
And then inside of this I'm going to create a class and this will be the Post's page in case I ever

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.800
want to edit this.

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.970
And then inside of that I'll create a container and then inside of that I'll create a row and then what

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.720
we're gonna do here is just have three blocks and it's going to be just like we did with the groups

18
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.570
they'll be pre-post the post content and then post post so pre-post and then I'm just going to delete

19
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.300
this blank space and copy and paste this.

20
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.010
So this should look really familiar to you after we did the group base.

21
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.990
So pre-post.

22
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.240
And then this is going to be called Post underscore content and then we'll call Post Post kind of a

23
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.130
weird fortune with the words there but that's OK.

24
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.990
And that's basically all you have to do with the post underscore base smell file just like we did with

25
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.180
the group based the ex-teammate File.

26
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.450
Coming up next we're going to do is create the post form.

27
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.510
So I'm going to open up post underscore form.

28
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.530
H Tim L.

29
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.030
And this is the email template that's linked to creating a new post.

30
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.730
We're going to say extends from post slash post.

31
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.140
They start each team L and then we're going to load bootstrap 3.

32
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.100
And hopefully this feels really familiar to you because this is essentially just like that group form

33
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.980
page and then we're going to have our block and that will be the post content that we're going to say

34
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.030
age 4 or age 3 whatever you want create a new post and then we'll insert a form here.

35
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.950
And the class we actually will just give this ID in case we ever want to mess around with it.

36
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:51.260
Just be post form id and then the action is going to go back to your old template there's going to be

37
00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:00.700
Yoro posts create and then we're going to say method is POSSO that's all we need here inside of the

38
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.390
actual form.

39
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.100
We need a couple of things one as always is Earthsea SRF tokin.

40
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.010
Then we're going to actually call our form.

41
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.390
So let's do that with a template tag.

42
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.960
And this reason bootstrap three resequence say bootstrap underscore form make this look nice and then

43
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.200
pass and form.

44
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.130
Once you've done that which is the input button.

45
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.740
So have the input button the type is submit the name that doesn't really need a name the value will

46
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.450
give it the value of post so it can connect to it later.

47
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.600
Then let's go ahead and give it a class based off some bootstrap things so say between between primary

48
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.230
and a lot of this is really up to you by and large just style calls and that's all we have to do for

49
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.570
the post form.

50
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.720
So far everything is looking really similar to what we did with the group's application.

51
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.110
The post base is really similar to that group base and then post forum really similar to the group forum.

52
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.400
Now let's move on to the actual post list.

53
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.360
H T.M..

54
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.600
So again this is the post lists the html file the one I'm working in right now and we're going to do

55
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:14.470
here is start off by extending to say extends post slash posts underscore based h tim L and then we're

56
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.710
going to call our blocks or block we'll say pre post content and we'll start off here by saying div

57
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.960
class call M.D dash 4.

58
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.710
Then the next thing I want to do is check if a user is actually authenticated.

59
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.260
So what I can do here is say if and here I need to call the request user is authenticated.

60
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.300
And then inside of that we're going to say create a div class and we're going to use some kind of bootstrap

61
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.940
stuff so card with shadow.

62
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.260
Again this is all really styling calls so you don't have to do it this way.

63
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.670
In fact you can just do no classes if you kind of wave a good idea of the bare bones content and then

64
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.980
adding classes as you get more and more familiar bootstrap.

65
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:11.100
But inside of this we'll have a whip's a title that we can later edit and this is just going to say

66
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.160
your group's.

67
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:22.210
So if the users log then we want to list out their groups and then we're going to say create an unordered

68
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.630
list and we'll give this a class list.

69
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.570
Onst I don't again you don't really need to follow along with his classes exactly.

70
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.510
The next thing we're going to do inside this unordered list is say for member score group and just be

71
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.920
a variable name whatever you want to call it in.

72
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.420
And so we're going to look a little familiar we'll say get user groups and you might be wondering this

73
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.030
looks a little familiar this underscore user groups.

74
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.930
So what that actually is is if you remember back on the groups application when we were working with

75
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.260
the models that PI file underneath groups we had this from Django import template register is equal

76
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.280
to template library.

77
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.940
And that actually allowed us to if we scroll down over here use this related name to actually grab that

78
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.260
and you can add the underscore to connect to the group member.

79
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.290
Now definitely check that documentation because this is more of an advanced thing but basically that

80
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.140
allows us to do a link from the post to the group member.

81
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.490
So we'll come back to post list.

82
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.230
And now we're saying for member group and get user groups.

83
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.600
Essentially if you're a user for every group that you're actually a member of where we're going to do

84
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.430
is create a list item and that's going to be an anchor tag inside of that.

85
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:49.720
And essentially it's just going to say your L groups single the slug let's make sure that's in single

86
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:59.240
quotes and spaced out correctly for the slug here is equal to member underscore group dot group dot

87
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.310
slug.

88
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.500
OK.

89
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.420
So basically grabbing the member group inside of all the users groups and then grabbing that group off

90
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.540
of that model and then grabbing slug off for that group.

91
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.300
So that's what that entire line is doing when me collapse tree so you can see the whole thing a little

92
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.460
better.

93
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.170
Definitely a more advanced call there.

94
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.910
And what I'm going to do is add a class to that list element.

95
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.870
So it just looks a little nicer in the future.

96
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.940
So let's make this class equal to.

97
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:35.700
And we're going say group and then add on Ally with bullet save that and then that's going to end our

98
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.320
for loop and that will be the end of an ordered list.

99
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.920
And we're going to keep going down until we get to that end if.

100
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.740
OK.

101
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.800
So so far we have that little view where someone can see all the groups that they belong to and then

102
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.300
we're going to continue on after this.

103
00:07:51.300 --> 00:08:03.080
And if we'll create another div and we'll say Card card with chateau than inside of this will create

104
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:12.630
a div the class call will be contents and then we'll say heading 5 and we'll give this a class equal

105
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:21.120
to title and this will be just all groups in the same unordered list.

106
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:30.340
And inside let's give this a class B list list dash and style in case we ever edit that.

107
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.670
And here we're going to say is another for loop.

108
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:46.290
We'll say for other group in get underscore other underscore groups create a list elements and then

109
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.650
we will say create anchor tag where the reference is going to be the following.

110
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.370
All groups single essentially we just did.

111
00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:01.980
The slug is equal to make sure that single quotes there correctly go where that slug is equal to other

112
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.830
group slug.

113
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.960
So there I'm not actually calling a member group so I don't need to call other group that group the

114
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.680
group itself is right here and there other group.

115
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:19.030
OK now we'll end the four and let's also give this list a nice class that looks a little nicer.

116
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:26.950
So this list element is going to have a class equal to group and we'll say ally with a bullet.

117
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:36.130
And say that if a bullet and then end that for a loop then finally all the way past this unordered list

118
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:42.000
and all the lives right after this end block we're going to scroll down and create another block here.

119
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:51.030
So will say block post content and then inside of this we'll say div class and this is going to be called

120
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.950
to call M.D 8.

121
00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.560
Now we're going to save for the post in post list.

122
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.340
We will inject that underscore post which we're going to work on in just a little bit.

123
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.540
We'll say include.

124
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:13.860
We've actually already seen this before in the groups pages will say posts underscore poster T.M. and

125
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.060
then save that.

126
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:21.150
So here include are going to be able to inject post H.C. email and we have these two basic things one

127
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.800
is checking if the request geezer's authenticated.

128
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.730
We have that list right here of those member groups.

129
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.330
OK saving that.

130
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.330
Let's move along.

131
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.660
I'm going to close this.

132
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.770
So let's deal with the actual underscore.

133
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.230
Post to each team l file.

134
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.920
Since I just down here said include it so I will open up.

135
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.040
Underscore postdates e-mails underscore post.

136
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.710
H Tim L that I'm about to do.

137
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:50.850
Let's underscore again find your underscore postdates kill file and then hear what you will do is we

138
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:57.330
actually don't need to extend from because we know we're directly going to inject this right here we're

139
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.620
not going to have it be part of a full page by itself.

140
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.740
So in that case we actually don't need say extends.

141
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:10.560
Instead we basically start right where we want to which is going to be something like a div so have

142
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.680
a div here and then the heading 3 is going to just be the post message.

143
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:25.970
Each T.M. and then we want it to be safe so that it looks good we'll say DIVX and we'll give this class

144
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.350
media abody

145
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.800
and then we'll have a strong call here are bulled it doesn't really matter.

146
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.410
We've post user the user name.

147
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:44.260
It's the actual name of the person here that's going to be the at symbol and then we'll have H5 and

148
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.520
let's give this a class of media heading.

149
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.430
And again we may or may not use all these classes really up to you that after that we're going to have

150
00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:02.690
a span and then we will say let's give this band a class for user name OK.

151
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:08.490
And then inside of this we will say give an anchor tag that anchor tag.

152
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.740
It's going to be a URL reference so you are l two posts.

153
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.460
Make sure that's in quotes posts for the user.

154
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:23.500
So that's essentially a link to that actual user's individual posts and then or the user name is equal

155
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.870
to post user or user name.

156
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.720
OK so what does that actually mean.

157
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:36.550
Well basically we're going to have the post message and then whoever wrote the post that means the actual

158
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.450
username and then if you click on that username which is going to be something like Jose or at Sindy

159
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.120
etcetera whatever their username is it will take you to all the posts for up to kill user.

160
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.670
And this essentially is the link between clicking on someone's name and then viewing their quote unquote

161
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.290
profile.

162
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.400
In our case the profile is really simple it's just a list of all the user's posts.

163
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.100
OK.

164
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:05.310
So that ends that span the next you're going to do is create a little time tag.

165
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:11.110
So the time tag is actually going to allow us to post the time and that's going to essentially indicate

166
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.170
what time was this post created.

167
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.750
So we'll give this class equal to time in case we ever want to edit that.

168
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:26.500
And then inside of this will be in other anchor tag and then we'll say Tref And let's just have this

169
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:41.280
take you back to your L posts single where the user name is equal to postop user the user name where

170
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.970
the primary key is equal to the post primary key.

171
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.540
Okay great then we can actually kind of close that off in case it's getting too long and that will end

172
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:56.480
that time and then all we should do is actually paste this whole thing inside of the heading when we

173
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.040
grab that closing tag and paste it right here.

174
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.690
There we go.

175
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.800
And then we have our div tags.

176
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.020
So let's continue on by right after this.

177
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:16.150
H5 we're going to create a new div and we'll give it again media filter class filter and we're going

178
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:24.030
to say if inside of this if statement I will check if the user is authenticated.

179
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:30.730
So if the user is authenticated and they also want to confirm that not only is the user a log then but

180
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.410
the actual post is it the users post.

181
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:39.560
So I want to say and if Post user is equal to the current user.

182
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.140
So if those two things are true then this person should be able to delete the post.

183
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:54.430
Which means we're going to have an anchor tag here and we'll send them to your all of posts delete where

184
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.490
the primary key is equal to postop primary key.

185
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.350
OK and then let's go ahead and give this couple of more things here.

186
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.870
You can also give something like a title if you really wanted to.

187
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:13.640
So we could say title delete and then let's also give this a class.

188
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:19.490
So I was getting a little too far going to continue if they could take their class this will just be

189
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:27.670
a basic class between BT and dash simple it's a simple button there.

190
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:35.110
And then inside of this let's actually create a spam's we can call a glyph icon I'll say class and then

191
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:52.700
glyph icon glyph I can remove text danger and then we're also going to say oops that's it in school

192
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.010
too true.

193
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.520
And basically you may have seen hidden before but you haven't seen a are I a hit.

194
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.180
So what that is that's accessible rich Internet applications and that finds a way to make the Web content

195
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.120
in web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

196
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.860
So basically what happens is if certain people have disabilities they have screen readers so they kind

197
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.400
of hover their mouse or they open up a window and it starts reading stuff for them.

198
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.510
So instead of just saying hidden for people with those disabilities are using the screen readers we

199
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.730
have this ere are I a cache hidden.

200
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.550
And basically what that means is the hidden attribute that's new and each team of five it tells browsers

201
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.500
not to display the element and this particular one tells screen readers to ignore the element and not

202
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.440
read it out loud.

203
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.870
So again this is actually just kind of keeping an eye on people with disabilities and putting it in

204
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.240
their.

205
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.700
So let's continue along after that.

206
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.510
We're going to just create the actual delete.

207
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:53.520
So we'll see span let's not Spain.

208
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.480
Make sure to right that again.

209
00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.140
Spam and let's give this a class equal to text.

210
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:07.620
Dash danger icon dash label and will say delete.

211
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.300
That's going to be the end if there.

212
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.260
And that's it for this underscore post.

213
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.340
So you should have three closing divs after that.

214
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.520
At the very bottom.

215
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.430
OK.

216
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.210
So that's it for underscore.

217
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.700
Post.

218
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.760
We saw a couple of more things.

219
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.820
Do we finished underscore post Finnis post underscore ascorbate CML haven't confirmed delete.

220
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.440
So let's take care of that now.

221
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.550
That was pretty straightforward.

222
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:40.400
We're going to do is say extends post slash post base lips each T.M. and then we're going to say a block

223
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.660
of post content.

224
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:53.490
Let's create a heading three asking something like Are you sure you want to delete this post.

225
00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:04.550
Questionmark then inside of this will say DIVX and loops enter and then we'll say class posts.

226
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.230
And this is where we're going to include to include

227
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:19.580
PPO's slash underscore poster each symbol and then we can say it with post equal to object and then

228
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.660
we'll say hide delete equal to true.

229
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.190
We make sure that an XLE doubles here.

230
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.120
OK so there's a little include inside of that div.

231
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:35.880
So I actually kind of includes a poster going to delete and then finally we need our form so the form

232
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.270
doesn't need a class C we need an action.

233
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:46.620
We just need a method to post Ticken a quick C S a token and then will say input type is submit essentially

234
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.690
just saying yes I want to delete.

235
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.610
We can give it a value of confirmed delete just to make it really obvious to the user that they're about

236
00:18:53.610 --> 00:19:00.730
to delete their posts confirm deletes and then skip this class good class.

237
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:08.530
Probably danger button and let's give it large So we have this beauty in beauty and danger between large

238
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.720
and will create a link here.

239
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:22.290
For your L posts single is essentially going to be the cancelbot that we're building out.

240
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:27.890
User name is equal to user not user name since we know they have to be logged in to even reach this

241
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:33.100
page and then primary key will just be object the primary key.

242
00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.500
Actually just the way to go back and let's make sure it's spelt right.

243
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.160
You are l.

244
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:45.910
Go so they can either hit this or confirm the input button which submits that the DO want delete this

245
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.710
which is linked to our delete view or they have this cancel button which supposed to be essentially

246
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:59.630
a link here and then let's say cancel OK perfect and actually we need to give this a class.

247
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.960
It looks good.

248
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:08.490
So instead of this anchor tag I'm going to give the class it will have that class speak to say between

249
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:15.280
batin dashed simple beats and large between the thoughts.

250
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.590
It just keeps attacking them.

251
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.380
That really doesn't matter.

252
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.900
OK.

253
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.340
So that's looking good.

254
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.280
That's the end of our form.

255
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.480
That should be in the book.

256
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.600
So there is the confirmed delete essentially just saying OK you want to delete this if not take them

257
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.810
back to that actual post the individual post the tell you.

258
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.490
OK speaking of detail.

259
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.540
That's one of the ones you have left.

260
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.140
We have post forum posts list and we selected a user post list which is going to be really similar post

261
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.450
list.

262
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.250
But let's take out that post the till page first.

263
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.770
Luckily for us we actually took care of a lot of that work.

264
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:55.540
So we just need to extend from post posts underscore base HTL and then say give a block of post underscore

265
00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.290
content create a div class of call dash.

266
00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.660
The Dash 8.

267
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.760
And then we're just going to include post slash underscore postdates smell.

268
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.610
That's all we have to do because basically all the heavy lifting of the actual post detail page was

269
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.010
done an underscore posterized C.M. perfect.

270
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.870
So we're going to have that ready to go.

271
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.970
Then we have post four minutes ago post list and we just need the user post lists which is actually

272
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:25.630
quite simple.

273
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:36.660
So a user post list is going to extends from posts underscore posts based T.M. will have a block here

274
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:44.370
for the pre-post and then inside of this we'll have a div and let's make this be call M.D for

275
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:56.540
each one and we'll say it's call say post user dot username.

276
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.170
So that actually shows the user name before the post.

277
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.760
You can also put this above the post isn't really meant or below the post so either above or below the

278
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.170
post where we prefer these names.

279
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.580
That's fine.

280
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.850
We're going to say block post content.

281
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.530
We're created for this.

282
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.010
And the class is going to be call dash.

283
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:26.960
The Dash 8 is going to be a for loop that says for post in post underscore list.

284
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:37.530
What we'll do is include Post forward slash underscore poster HTL say that and then that's actually

285
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.710
it for user post list.

286
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.200
OK.

287
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.330
So definitely did a lot of the heavy lifting for the templates.

288
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.680
This is stuff that is really easy to make a typo and I'm sure I've made one.

289
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.890
Along the way which you're going to be the bugging in just a little bit.

290
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.840
So in the very next lecture we're going to do is make sure all our settings and our migrations are ready

291
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.870
to go and then we'll start debugging.

292
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:02.220
Definitely check against the provided note files to make sure that everything you have matches up with

293
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.330
those no files.

294
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.180
Thanks everyone and I'll see if the next lecture.
