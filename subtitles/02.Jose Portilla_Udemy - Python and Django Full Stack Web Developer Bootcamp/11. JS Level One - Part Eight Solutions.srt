Hello everyone and welcome back to part A.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,210
We're going to be going over the solutions to the loop exercise questions from the previous lecture.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,340
So let's continue going to open up my editor to get started.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,310
OK here we have the actual problems uploaded in the javascript with the comment that I had to follow.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,430
Now we're going to be doing.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,170
First is problem one where how do you use a for loop to Prince or console log out the word hello five

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,950
times and we never actually did something quite like this.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,160
But hopefully you're able to figure it out with both methods.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:41,180
So if a while loop Let's show you how we can do that we'll see variable x is equal to zero.

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,910
And you could have chosen any variable name here that the name doesn't actually matter.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,150
The say a while loop.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,750
Now I'll say while X is less than five I'm going to cancel that log.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,690
Hello and then I want to remember to add 1 to X and increment it.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,520
So now I run my code I see hello and it's been output 5 times.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,910
Google Chrome just lets you know that this little shortcut the bubble of Fibe there.

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,950
Up next we have the for loop and I wanted to use a for loop to do this.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,930
So essentially you can just break down what we were doing up here above.

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,930
So I have variable I's equal to zero.

19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,740
Since I is going to be less than five I put that here and I'll leave.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,900
Plus plus.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,790
And then I can actually just copy and paste the cancel command and just to make sure it's actually working.

22
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,610
I'm going to say something like hello with for loop.

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,080
We'll save that.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,640
Let's run this code and I see hello and then hello a for loop.

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,350
The above ran five times.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,770
Great let's move on to Problem Two problem too just to use loops to cancel that log or print out all

27
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,020
the odd numbers from 1 to 25.

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,740
And we wanted to do this using two methods the while loop and then a for loop.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,590
Let's start off with the While loop.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm going to make a variable called num and in the solutions actually just reassign them from a previous

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,950
problem.

32
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:26,770
And then I'm going to say while my num is less than 25 if numb maade to is not equal to zero.

33
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,460
Remember previously if you want to check for an even number.

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,460
We said Number two equals zero.

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,140
In this case we're doing the exact opposite for our numbers.

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,770
I'm going to log that NUM and then I also want to make sure that I continually add to them.

37
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,850
So I'll just say no.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,350
Plus plus.

39
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,880
So let's make sure that actually works and want to refresh my page here.

40
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,270
And there are all the numbers one all the way to 23 for the while loop and now for the for loop.

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,460
Let's do that as well.

42
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:05,990
Ongoing same for and then I'm going to fix some of these so it says instead of the actual length of

43
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:14,160
the array this is going to be five Let's expand this a little bit.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:24,270
So I'm going to say if I maade to is not equal to zero.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,070
Log.

46
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,720
I that's really all there is to this.

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,820
Make sure my brackets are balanced so I'll save that.

48
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,130
And let's comment everything else out.

49
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,560
So we make sure that only that is running.

50
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,250
So I will save this scroll the way down refresh my page and here I only see one through three make sure

51
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,510
it went all the way.

52
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,110
That should have been 25.

53
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,690
OK.

54
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,310
Now is refresh page.

55
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,600
And there we have it 1 through 23.

56
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,330
Great.

57
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,870
And that's how you could do it with a for loop.

58
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,160
So that's it just to pretty simple problems and hopefully you can begin to see the relationship between

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,990
the while loop and the for.

60
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,860
OK.

61
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,920
Thanks everybody.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,540
And in the next lecture we're going to get practice on everything we covered in javascript level 1 with

63
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,580
a little bit of an assessment project.

64
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:13,950
Thanks.

65
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,090
And I'll see at the next lecture.
