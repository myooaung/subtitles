00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,900
Well everyone and welcome to part two content interaction in this lecture.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,110
We're going to be seeing more examples of how to interact with the c.m. from the document object model.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,950
We'll show you how to do things such as change text change the age to smell code and affect the attributes

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,250
the relevant files for the structure are part to content that H.T. T.M..

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,130
That's the actual file how open my browser and part to interact but yes that's just the copy of all

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,590
the commands I'll be inputting into the console.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,790
Let's get started by opening up to content buddy T.M. in our browser.

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,790
All right so here we have the HTL document open and we're going to be doing is showing you how to change

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,910
the text it's him all content and attributes with the actual Dom.

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,860
So imagine that you've used queery selector to actually select an element from the document object model

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,400
and you call that variable.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,320
My variable then you could use some of these methods to actually affect or interact with it.

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,230
So we could call my variable dot text content and that returns the actual text.

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,120
So you could set that equal to some new text if you wanted to change the text or whatever.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,310
Team l variable you're messing around with or if you want it to actually affect the T.M. and have effects

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,170
on things such as the strong tags or the emphasis tags.

17
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,770
You could do something like inner or excuse me inner H.T. a male and that returns the actual age to

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,840
a male if you want to effect attributes or interact with them you can use the doc get attribute or the

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,110
set attribute.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,550
Now let's show some actual examples of all this.

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,290
Here I'm going to be actually manipulating this page and I'm looking at right now.

22
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,800
So again to edit styles you've already seen we can use the dot style tag.

23
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,490
Now we're going to show you how to edit actually email or text or attributes.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,570
So I'm going to grab this paragraph right here that I'm highlighting.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,060
Let's show you how we can do that or create a new variable let's call it P for paragraph.

26
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,820
Although you can probably call it whatever you want.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:05,240
Well say document dot query selector and I'm going to grab the paragraph tag here and if I type paragraph

28
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,450
I can see I have the paragraph tag and I can expand this to actually view everything that says to edit

29
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,080
styles.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,260
I see there's a link here it's attributes.

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,050
So if I click on this attributes link it takes me to Google dot com.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,270
So here I see Google opening up now what you actually want to do is change some of the text here.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So I will clear this and I'm going to say P Di

34
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,950
text content and I can set it equal to any thing that I want.

35
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,630
So let's call it all new text.

36
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,630
And then hit enter.

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,540
And now I see that I've actually changed the text here.

38
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,730
So it says new text.

39
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,080
Now imagine that I wanted to make the text bold.

40
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:03,220
Well what I can't do is this I'm not able to say text content and then passen a strong tag and say something

41
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,690
like I'm bold closing strong tag.

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,010
The reason I'm not able to do something like this I will see why what happens is because I'm just grabbing

43
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,190
the text content.

44
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,260
If I actually want to affect the age T.M. I need to grab the inner h tim L.

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,750
So I will say P dot inner HVM L and I'm going set it equal now to I previously did.

46
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:33,710
So let's grab this and just copy and paste it back grab it with the quotes and then hit enter.

47
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:38,940
And I can see now my paragraph is in bold says I'm bold and I can see that it's darker.

48
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,180
So that's different between text content and each T.M. if you want to actually pass in HTL tax when

49
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,430
you're interacting with the HTML then you're going to need to call in each team instead of just text

50
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,690
content.

51
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,430
Now let's show you how you can get attributes and set attributes.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,430
So if we look down here there's a link to Facebook all the way here at the end so click on this.

53
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,450
It takes me to Facebook and says I'm another Hetter with the special I.D. so don't worry about that

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,320
for right now.

55
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:13,880
Instead what I'm going to do is clear my console and I'm going to grab everything with the special I.D.

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:25,490
so I'll save our special as equal to document weary selector and remember it's night.

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:34,920
So I say hashtags and say I can use CSSA style selectors and then say special and again you would use

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,530
there.

59
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,020
And again you would have to know that there's a special I.D. in the HP M-L here it's actually telling

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,930
me that but you'd have to actually reference the symbol to know this.

61
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,260
So it's not like special is just some sort of normal ID.

62
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,690
So here I can see now if I type in special I have heading for IDs with a special.

63
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,020
It says I'm in the header.

64
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,750
Looks like the header has emphasis.

65
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,800
And then I also see h ref to Facebook dot com.

66
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,680
Now how can I actually change this.

67
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:17,140
Well I can say this I can say variable special a is equal to.

68
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:25,530
And then I'm going to grab special dot and I will do a query selector on that LCA query selector grabbed

69
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,120
the anchor incontact

70
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,910
enter and now when I see special 8 I see that I only grab Denker tag so i can see that I can actually

71
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,240
call multiple queries selectors until I actually find or get what I'm looking for.

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,520
So here's the ref it goes to Facebook dot com actually want to get just the attribute.

73
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,140
I can say special

74
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:02,310
attribute and then I can grab the Tref itself if I only want to grab that link if I want to change the

75
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,980
attribute that I need to use the same attribute.

76
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:13,000
So I need to say especially the set attribute and the stakes in two arguments the attribute that you

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,170
want to change.

78
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,510
And then the actual value you want to change it to.

79
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,440
So I'll say HTP Yes and let's change it to something like Amazon.com

80
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,040
we hit enter and now we've actually changed this to Amazon.com.

81
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,940
So if I click on this link instead of Facebook we see that it takes me to Amazon.

82
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,750
All right.

83
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,250
So that's the general way of using these four methods member text content is just for returning the

84
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,440
text interchange team l returns the actual each T.M..

85
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,890
And if you want to effect attributes within something you need to do it with set attribute if you want

86
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,450
to just grab the attribute and get say attribute if you want to change it instead of doing just an equal

87
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,190
sign like we said earlier you said attribute where the first argument is the actual attribute and the

88
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,530
second argument is what you want to set it to.

89
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,370
All right thanks everyone if you have any questions feel free to post to the Q&amp;A forums.

90
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,770
And I'm happy to help you out.

91
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,770
I'll see you at the next lecture.
