Hello everyone and welcome to part six exercise review.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,540
You've learned about the basic data types and data structures in Python and now it's time to put your

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,180
new skills to the test.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,670
The part 6 underscore exercise underscore review that py file has commented tasks for you to complete.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,640
So let's go ahead and take a quick look at it.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,830
You can find this file under the python level one folder.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,250
It's just five simple problems.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,770
So let's take a quick look.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,220
OK.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,370
This is what the file looks like.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:30,940
Part 6.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,610
Exercise review and problem one just says this given the string S is equal to jingo.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,070
You want to use indexing to print out the following.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,550
The D O.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,060
D.

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,260
Jan just Jan and then just go.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:50,110
So again you string indexing to print out the as 1 2 3 4 or 5 different portions of the string and then

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,800
as a bonus question you can use indexing to reverse the string.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,230
You may want to review the notes because we didn't actually show that in the lecture video OK.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,070
Problem number two given this nested list right here this is l equals 3:7.

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,930
Then there's a nested list inside of it.

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,980
I want you to reassign hello to B.

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,210
Goodbye problem 3.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,630
Using keys and indexing grab Hello from the following dictionaries.

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,640
So here we have three simple dictionaries we can see as they go wrong.

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,140
They get more and more nested.

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:29,350
So what you need to do is grab Hello from D-1 dictionary one D2 dictionary to and then D-3.

28
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,360
And remember there's also lists and D-3.

29
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,260
So you have dictionaries inside of a list inside of a dictionary inside of a list etc..

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,360
This one is quite tricky so take your time with D-3 see if you can work.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,940
Layer by layer problem.

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,720
Float for.

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,780
Says to use a set to find the unique values of the list below.

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,400
Hopefully you're able to do that we kind of just did that in the last lecture so maybe review that.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,610
If you're stuck on problem for and then problem 5 It says you're given two variables.

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,760
Age is equal to this integer for name as equal to Samie.

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,780
I want you to use print formatting to print the following string.

38
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,590
Hello my dog's name is Sammy and he is four years old.

39
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,160
So again review the format method of what's known as string interpellation or putting these two as strings

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,480
inside of this string.

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,350
Ok thanks everyone and I will see at the next lecture where we're going to be going over the solutions.
