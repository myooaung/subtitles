Hello everyone and welcome to part six modules and packages.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.290
You've seen Python.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.100
Import statements before that you've probably wondered how do they work and how we create our own.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.270
It's actually quite simple.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.600
And we'll talk about it more when we actually reach Shingo.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
Well let's find out the very basics of modules and get started with the editor.

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.020
OK so here I am at the editor and in this lecture we're basically just going to be showing you how you

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.320
can create your own module and then import it into another file.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.520
So here under my project folder going to Right-Click add a new file and I will call this my module that

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:49.940
pie in here is going to be a very simple function will say func in module close print CS and this just

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:04.520
prints out I am inside the my module up-I wraps up my file save that and then I will create a new file.

12
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.000
And I will call this my program that pi and this is going to be representative of my program so we can

13
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.310
even do something like split left and right here so I can see them at same time.

14
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.470
So again there's my module and here's my program and we can see they're both inside the same folder

15
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.490
so how can I actually grab code from my module that pi and use it in my program.

16
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.340
Well there's various ways and I'll show you the simplest.

17
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.740
First we can say import my module and note that there's other things here.

18
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.590
So there's the built in modules and the modules you use Condon's taller Pippin's Stallworth and those

19
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.590
are saved in a specific location in Python that you can always call them from the matter where you are.

20
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.930
In this case it's actually in the same folder as this file I can call my module and then if I want to

21
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.890
call a function from my module I can say my module dots function module and then I can say close parentheses

22
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.490
to actually call it.

23
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.980
So now if I say Python and call my program the PI I get back I'm inside my module that py file in when

24
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.930
you ran that file you probably noticed that you got this py cache folder and inside ASPI cache folder

25
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.210
is some my module that C Python code up high C and if you try to open then read it.

26
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.300
It's just a bunch of junk in here that you not be able to actually see.

27
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.250
And basically what happens is when you run a program in Python the interpreter compiles it to byte code

28
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.640
first.

29
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.520
And thats kind of an oversimplification but essentially its stores that in the pie cache folder.

30
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.090
And if you look in there you find a bunch of files sharing the names of the dot PI files in your projects

31
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.580
folder only their extensions are going to be PI that PI C and essentially what this is its bytecode

32
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.570
compiled optimized bytecode compiled versions of your programs file.

33
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.510
And if you're just a programmer you can essentially just ignore it.

34
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.190
All it does is it makes your program start a little faster.

35
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.950
The next time you run it and when your script changed you're going to be recompiled.

36
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.460
And if you delete the files with the whole folder and run your program again they're going to reappear

37
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.620
again.

38
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.150
Really you can just pretty much ignore this pie cache file.

39
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.970
But I just want you to be aware and don't be surprised if you see it being created.

40
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.390
OK moving along.

41
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.650
Let's show you the other various ways you can import from a module.

42
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.110
So what way again import the actual file and then call it off my module.

43
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.670
In other way is to say import module as something so you don't want to write my module every time on

44
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.760
a function for my module so maybe say import as an M and then you can shorten my module here to just

45
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.600
add them and I save that I run Python my program that pi and I still get I am inside the module that

46
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.260
py file.

47
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.030
So that's another way you can call it if you actually just plan on using a few specific functions from

48
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.320
my module that pi.

49
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.190
You probably don't want to import the entire module you want to import a few functions.

50
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.970
And in that case you can say from my module import and then the name of the function or classes you

51
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.570
want to import.

52
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.000
So we say import funkin module and then I don't need to call anything CCRI facing it or prefixing it

53
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.680
we'll just say funkin module run this and I can see I am inside the my module that py file.

54
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.340
Now let's see one last example and this is the example that I'm going to show you but it's really not

55
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.770
recommended that you do this.

56
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.910
You can say from my module import Asterix and this will import everything from my module and you can

57
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.990
just call funkin module just like we did last time.

58
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.180
So this is frowned upon you shouldn't really do this sort of Asterix behavior.

59
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.330
But basically the reason for that is it kind of waste a lot of memory and importing everything with

60
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.710
this Asterix.

61
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.210
OK.

62
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.160
So again use the first three months I showed you and you can always reference a nose for that.

63
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.830
Hopefully now you have a basic understanding of how you can create one PI file a bunch of functions

64
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.280
or classes and then call it from another file.

65
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.140
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
