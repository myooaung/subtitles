00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,180
Hello everyone and welcome to this advanced topic section.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,930
Well we're going to be discussing customizing the jingo adamant interface now often the default admin

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,820
page is great and it's all we need for our projects but sometimes we may also want to expand with the

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,950
Admin Page can do and we also have a lot of tools and Django to customize it to our own needs and we're

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,240
going to now learn how to customize it.

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,920
Adam page as well as features of the atom in page.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,740
So we're going to learn how to do the following.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,070
We'll discuss a quick review of the atom in page how it's used.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,050
Then we'll change the out in page template so you can actually overwrite templates on the Admin Page

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,820
and that will show you things like changing the order of fields that show up and adding search and filters

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,040
to the Admin site.

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,440
We're going to start by quickly creating a new project an application you won't really do anything on

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,110
the front end since we really only are going to focus on the Adamant backend.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,690
So essentially it's just going to be an empty front and we have two models connected and registered

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,950
to the admin.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,170
Let's shift to our editor and get started.

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,470
OK.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,340
Here I am at the Adam text editor and one I'm going to do is just create a new project.

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,410
I've gone ahead and created a new folder on my desktop called test to do this and really it doesn't

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,780
matter too much for the size to do this.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,160
And we're going to call this my underscore video rental.

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,820
We're going to kind of make it as if it's a rental video store web site.

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,840
So go ahead and create that project and then I'm going to see the into my video rental here and then

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,290
offer this I'll say jingo admen star app and we'll just call this app videos.

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,860
And this is where we're going to have a model PI file and an admin file that we can later kind of play

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,760
around with.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,110
So to expand this make sure that's all worked out.

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,500
So you see my video rental I see videos I see models.

29
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,310
So what I'm going to do is in my settings start by going to make sure I register this video here somewhere

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,610
scroll down and and there are installed apps.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,420
Just go ahead and add that app name that we just created called videos.

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,350
Save that.

33
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,060
Always make sure you save so you can have those changes.

34
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,590
There we're going to come over here to models and we're going to quickly create two models.

35
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,110
Nothing too major here.

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,820
The models we're going to create essentially just going to mimic having a movie and having a customer.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,450
So we'll say.

38
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,030
Class movie.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:36,000
And then we'll say models the model and then let's give it some fields will say tidal is models.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,120
And we'll have it be a character field.

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,950
Let's go ahead and give it a max length of 256 characters.

42
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,300
And then let's say the movie has a length of minutes.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,490
And this is since it's lengthened minutes we know it has to be a positive integer.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,610
So we'll have that be that type of field.

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,810
And then there's also a release year.

46
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,810
And technically that should also be a positive integer so we'll do that as well.

47
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,930
Just keeping things simple the main ideas not working with the models is working at the admin page.

48
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,470
We're essentially just creating these because we need something to play around with later on.

49
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:18,510
So I'm also going to create another model here called customer model and we'll say in her models not

50
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,360
model it let's say customers have a first name let's say models.

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,350
And that's also a character field if max length equal to 256.

52
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,410
You can always copy and paste this from the notes as well.

53
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,010
You don't want to type this all out.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,650
Now let's say last name is models.

55
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,770
Basically the same thing here has a max length of 256 and then finally let's say you have some sort

56
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,220
of phone number or some sort of digital code.

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,430
Doesn't matter too much but we'll have that would also be some positive interest field.

58
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,200
OK.

59
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,050
So command or control s to say that and then I'm going to make sure that I register these into the item

60
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,020
and file.

61
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,360
So we'll come over here.

62
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,800
To adamant that pie in our videos let's these We're going to say from the import models and then I'll

63
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,720
see adman that PSI thought register is register and I'm going to register my models that way I can see

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,500
them in the actual admin page.

65
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,790
So I'm also a customer.

66
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:28,670
And then Adam and that site the register models movie then it goes into control as to save that.

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,930
And let's go ahead and make sure we do our migrations.

68
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,670
So over here them of the terminal I can zoom in a little bit for you guys.

69
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,110
I'm going to do the following.

70
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:45,350
We'll say make sure say Python managed up high and then say make migrations.

71
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,340
And it went ahead and created model and movie or excuse me create a model customer created a model movie

72
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,040
that we're going to say Python managed up high and I'm going to migrate any changes that we have under

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
videos.

74
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
It may say running migrations.

75
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,240
There we go.

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,400
And then I always like to say make migrations one more time to make sure there's nothing left so no

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,340
changes that are perfect.

78
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,610
And since we're actually going to be using the admin interface we need to actually create a super user.

79
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,020
So let's make sure we do that as well.

80
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,560
We'll see Python managed up high and this line is create super user which you've done before and if

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,610
you get this error.

82
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,480
No such table off the user.

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,000
It's actually an easy fix.

84
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,730
It just means that you need to run Python managed that PI migrate.

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,030
So come over here back to the terminal and say Python managed up-I migrate.

86
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,640
Hit enter and let it migrate everything.

87
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,530
Now try it again.

88
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,740
Python managed up-I create super user and you should see it ask for your username.

89
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,220
I'll say Jose.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,180
Email address doesn't really matter we'll see.

91
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,270
Blank gmail dot com password.

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,480
I always use test password and type it in again.

93
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,300
Your password is hidden for security so there is no super user created successfully.

94
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,880
Let's make sure it all works out so we'll see say now Python managed up-I run server.

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,170
Enter there and then let's copy and paste the URL and bring it into our browser which I need to bring

96
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,840
over now.

97
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,340
So bringing in my browser it says it worked.

98
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,270
Congratulations your first single power to pay.

99
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,510
That's exactly what we want.

100
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,630
As I mentioned before really not going to be doing anything on this front end.

101
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,140
So let's go ahead and say slash admin and come over to her admin page my username and password are already

102
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,910
filled out for me.

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,050
Jose and his password.

104
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,910
You may have to fill it in the Pentagon.

105
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,430
How many times you've done this before.

106
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,380
Go ahead and log in.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,310
And here we go.

108
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,840
Let me make this full screen.

109
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,670
I could see my groups and my users.

110
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,310
That's often dictation authorization which we've actually discussed before you click here and users

111
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,700
can see Jose blank as email.

112
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,880
I have staff status etc. and you'll notice that I have a filter option here and we're going to discuss

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,270
later on how to create these sort of filters on our own models.

114
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,160
Bullets go ahead and go back home and check out our models.

115
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,770
See here I have customers.

116
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,400
And then if we come back to videos I can see here I have movies etc..

117
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,720
So let's go ahead and create some customers willing to add a new customer here.

118
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,300
Let's just how the customer be me as well.

119
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,740
And then some sort of phone number.

120
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,040
It doesn't really matter.

121
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,080
So we're going to save and add another and then we'll make a couple more kind of generic names random

122
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,460
phone numbers doesn't really matter save and add another and last one.

123
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,240
Say.

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,480
Let's say it's also Smith because I'm not very creative here.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,530
And then we're going to say safe.

126
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,390
OK so we have three customer objects.

127
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,640
Those really good.

128
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,420
We'll come back to videos.

129
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,610
Well same movies.

130
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,000
And then we'll add some movies here.

131
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,480
So let's go ahead and add in some Muzi movies traffic park let's say it's 120 minutes.

132
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,910
Really.

133
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,130
You're right.

134
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,900
1993 I'm guessing.

135
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:02,740
Save another one will say Star Wars like this one let's say it's 90 minutes I don't know if that's true

136
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,190
or not.

137
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,860
And I'll say 1973.

138
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,970
I also don't know if that's right.

139
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,000
And final is still one more movie here let's say Indiana Jones

140
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,700
let's say it was in 1984.

141
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,700
That's actually the length.

142
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:22,390
So let's also say it's once 134 minutes and 94 again Polish making that up.

143
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,020
OK.

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,600
So now we have three movie objects and we're ready to go.

145
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,480
So let's go ahead and go back to our page where we had the models and make the string representation

146
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,810
not just say movie object to have it actually say the name.

147
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:43,460
So we're going to go back over here and under models that PI notice at my class movie in class customer.

148
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,270
Let's go ahead and give it a string representation that we've done before.

149
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:54,140
We'll go ahead and here will say the F underscore underscore as TR underscore underscore it takes and

150
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,260
self and it's going to return.

151
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:04,780
Self-taught title will have that be the model and then also down here for the customer.

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,380
We're going to add a method here.

153
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,980
This will be self.

154
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,900
And then let's have it return which is how it returns self first name and then we're going to concatenate

155
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:29,290
it with self-taught last name and basically just concatenating the string and then a little space there

156
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,650
and then the last name.

157
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,530
So now that we've done all that let's go ahead and make sure that we migrate any changes that may have

158
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,490
occurred.

159
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,620
Will say Python managed of Pi migrate.

160
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,690
They'll say running migrations no migration is to apply.

161
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,120
So let's make sure that all works well say Python managed up high run server enter our servers running

162
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,600
again.

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,290
Let me come back to the browser and bring it over and I'm going to come straight to the Adamant page.

164
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,630
OK so is the admin page and if we took out customers now we see Cindy Smith Mike Smith Jose Portsea

165
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,760
and have it come back to movies.

166
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,430
We can see Indiana Jones star wars Rasik park.

167
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,530
So now that we have these kind of string representations here the string method we can see that it's

168
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:17,230
printing out that string as its name cyclic in Indiana Jones gets a tidal length and release year etc..

169
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,360
OK so that's the very basics of the Django adamant interface and everything that basically already comes

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,330
for free.

171
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,870
Nodine by free is that no work was involved.

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,540
Which is kind of crazy when you think about it because this is a lot of kind of power features and already

173
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,980
stuff that you can edit without having to code anything out.

174
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,820
All you have to do is basically read straight to the oddments site.

175
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,940
But we're going to learn how to add even more stuff to this.

176
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,340
So the first thing to learn is how you can edit this template.

177
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,430
Maybe you want things like a different color or instead of singing saying jingle admen or jingle administration

178
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,490
you wanted to say like Blockbuster's admin page or something like that.

179
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,860
Not every user is going to know what jingle Adam means etc..

180
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,690
So in the next lecture we're going to learn how to actually edit these templates.

181
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,060
Thanks and I'll see Ilir.
