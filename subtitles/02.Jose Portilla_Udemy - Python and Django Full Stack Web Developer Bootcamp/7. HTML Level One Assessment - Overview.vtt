00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.150
Hello everyone and welcome to the team at level 1 assessment.

2
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.550
It's time to practice all your new skills.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.720
You're going to be viewing him Tim file and recreating it based off of what you see in the browser.

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.700
The file We're going to be looking at is called H.

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.000
Underscore level underscore one underscore assessment HMO.

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.500
Let me show you how you should open this in your browser.

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.480
That way you don't actually view the H HTML file you just view it in your browser going to jump to Adam

8
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.650
text editor and my browser now.

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.190
OK here I am at the Adam text editor and I have my browser open.

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.240
Notice here that I'm looking at a new page that I asked him.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.490
You can be looking at any age T.M. file that you created.

12
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.680
And what I've done is I've made sure that I have here in the strictly the h him level one assessment

13
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.870
I asked him l file and you can find that in the course downloads it's under the HMO level one folder.

14
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.080
There's an aged him a on assessment that asked him I'll file there.

15
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.370
What you should do in order to do this exercise is don't click on this but right click and then select

16
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.890
Copy full path and then paste that path into your browser and then hit enter.

17
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.930
And this is what this Web site looks like.

18
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.660
It says Welcome to my Web site.

19
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.840
It says I'm excited to eventually learn Django.

20
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.450
Here's a link to the official jingle Web site and if you click on that link it takes us to the actual

21
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.720
official Gengel Web site which is W.W. that genome project dot com.

22
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.210
Notice it has HTP s there and going back we see we also have a picture of the Python logo and then it

23
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.760
says here are three reasons jingoes cool one is ridiculously fast it's reassuringly secure and it's

24
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.240
exceedingly scalable.

25
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.620
And then there's a bonus optional extra credit.

26
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.750
So what you're going to be doing is in your own HVM file you're going to try to recreate this.

27
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.670
So think of it while you're looking at this HMO site what kind of tag should this have.

28
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.440
And what kind of tag should these three lines have.

29
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.050
And notice one of them is a link to another Web site.

30
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.070
So think about what kind of attribute or tag that specifically should have and then you'll notice that

31
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.270
we also have this picture of the Python logo.

32
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.280
What I want you to do is either download a picture of the Python logo onto your computer and then set

33
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.520
the link locally or it's also good practice is using the image tags we've learned about is to actually

34
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.320
set the source to a image file that's hosted online which is actually what the solutions do.

35
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.670
And then you'll notice here we have a list.

36
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.970
It's a ordered list.

37
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.490
So one two three and there's finally a bonus or optional extra credit which is can you figure out how

38
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.810
to make a picture into a link.

39
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.750
So this first picture Python nothing happens if I click on it but this last one Django.

40
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.340
Notice how it's clickable.

41
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.170
So if I click on that picture it will actually take me to the Django project documentation just like

42
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.570
this top linked it.

43
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.930
So that's extra credit to figure out how to actually make a picture into a link.

44
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.250
We didn't cover that I'll cover that in the solution.

45
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.300
So that's just a bonus.

46
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.210
Again all you're doing is you're copying this file path into your browser and then in this age HTML

47
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.800
file try to manually recreate what's going on here.

48
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.020
And I'm going to be walking through this in the next lecture for the solutions.

49
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.620
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
