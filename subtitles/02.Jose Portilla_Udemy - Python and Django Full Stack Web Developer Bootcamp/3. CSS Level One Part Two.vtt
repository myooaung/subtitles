Hello everyone and welcome to part two of CSSA level 1 in part two we're going to begin to discuss backgrounds

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.390
and borders.

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.670
We will also show you how to utilize the div and span tags that we mentioned during the H.M.S. of the

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.490
course but were actually able to really use.

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
Let's get started by jumping to the editor and RC S S files.

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.470
All right so here I have my browser open as well as my editor.

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.970
I have in the mail file have called it part 2 that HVM L and I use this link with the stylesheet to

8
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.250
reference in other CSSA file called Part 2 underscore master that see SS and you can really name these

9
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.880
whatever you want.

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.050
Just make sure that your link is correct.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.220
To get started let's create a little bit of content in this age team l file.

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.810
I'm going to say this is a paragraph

13
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.570
and we'll also mention it's outside any device so outside any div container.

14
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.150
And then I'm actually going to create it live in a div allows us to essentially create a container.

15
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.010
And you'll notice that as I autocomplete this I get this class pop up don't worry about that for now

16
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.250
we're going to learn about class and a future lecturer and C Ss route.

17
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.820
Just leave it as the basic div opening and closing tags and I'm going to make three paragraph tags inside

18
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.590
of this.

19
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.370
First of all say I'm inside the div.

20
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:34.540
Second one will say I'm also inside the div and then the third one is going to say this inside div and

21
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:44.910
then we'll use the span tag that we've learned about and we'll say inside spam and save that let's refresh

22
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.670
make sure everything's working and we see here the subparagraph outside any div I'm inside.

23
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.200
Inside the div inside div and then inside span in all caps.

24
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.930
Perfect.

25
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.130
So now we have all the content.

26
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.590
It's time to play for CSSA file to see how we can affect that content.

27
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.490
And I'm a little zoomed in here so yours probably won't be as large in your browser as mine is but this

28
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.360
just so you can view it.

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.400
First thing I want to discuss is affecting the entire body of the H Tim L.

30
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.960
So you'll notice all or each Steimle content is inside these two body tags.

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.930
Everything else is just meta data.

32
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.560
So all the actually C.M. content is within these two body ties which means if I want to affect everything

33
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.170
essentially and that is T.M. I can call the body tag.

34
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.710
So that's my select attack.

35
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.700
And then I can't affect the property.

36
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.070
For instance one property I can affect is the background.

37
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.980
And you'll notice that Adam text editor will try to help you out with a bunch of prompts here.

38
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.560
Background color background position repeat etc..

39
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.740
Let's keep it basic and just do the background color and I will just type in a color here.

40
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.230
Let's type in gray as our background color going to save this and refreshes page.

41
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.280
And now I noticed that the entire background for everything in the body which is essentially all the

42
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.490
HTL content is great.

43
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.600
Perfect.

44
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.670
Now let's explore the div and remember the div allows us to essentially make these containers so div

45
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.720
or specify the background color for the DO to be something like Blue semi-colon.

46
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.440
Save it and refresh here and now everything that was inside the do these three lines including that

47
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.860
inside span are now have a background of blue and some also here for colors for very basic colors.

48
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.020
It doesn't matter whether you say background color or if you just say background either one of these

49
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.420
will work.

50
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.660
So if I save this and change this.

51
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.970
So let's say something like red which is going to be really bright and annoying.

52
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.650
So I want to suggest you do that but there it is.

53
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.400
I'm inside.

54
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.620
Nelson I have etc background essentially works the same way as background color when it comes to just

55
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.060
a very basic coloring.

56
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.700
Now let's explore how to do borders.

57
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.760
So borders are going to require three elements to it.

58
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.080
Basically the border color the border with and then the border style.

59
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.920
So for instance if I make a border for the div and I say the border let's say the border color is going

60
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.410
to be blue.

61
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.150
So the border colors blue if I click refresh here I'm not going to see anything.

62
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.100
And that's because I haven't defined the border with and the border style so I needed to find those

63
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.810
two first.

64
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.810
Otherwise CSSA doesn't really know how thick of a border I want be around this div so will say border

65
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.320
width and notice that we can actually specify left right top image bottom etc. are going to keep things

66
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.810
basic for now and just specify the border with.

67
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.790
And if I hit enter and text editor always here to help also says you want a thin border a median border

68
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.920
or a thick border.

69
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.520
So I'll say thick for now.

70
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.720
And then we'll also say border style and the border style will do is something like a well should say

71
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.050
dotted.

72
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.490
So let's save this refresh and you can see I have a dotted blue border around the div.

73
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.280
Now you may be also wondering well what's the difference between thick and thin.

74
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:18.370
So if I replace this with thin save that and refresh then I see if you can really see here but if you

75
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.380
do this on your computer you see extremely thin pixels here of the border.

76
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.470
Usually however you don't want to thin or thick you want to specify your own thickness and you can do

77
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:38.410
that by specifying the pixels so I can say something like 10 dx and that will tell me that I want the

78
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.840
border with to be 10 pixels.

79
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.380
If I refresh this then I can see 10 pixels here and later on will also see how to specify pixel widths

80
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.680
in relevance or in relationship to other elements.

81
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.250
So you don't have to have an absolute pixel.

82
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.660
So now let's make this super thick so make this 100 refresh this.

83
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.750
And I can see I have a really super thick.

84
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.900
So only four were able to show up.

85
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.500
Let's make this much thinner.

86
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.880
Something like five.

87
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:13.040
Save this refresh and here we have it five pixels can two pixels saving refresh and you get the idea.

88
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.580
All right.

89
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.180
So that was background background color and then the three elements you need for border the style the

90
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.280
width and the color.

91
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.730
And it's a lot of fun to play around with the styles especially since the Adam text editor is really

92
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.840
going to help you choose styles.

93
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.490
You can also do things such as a double refresh.

94
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.380
You can see this kind of double border almost looks like a painting.

95
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.250
OK.

96
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.640
So that was how we can affect things inside the div.

97
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.050
Now let's show you how we can affect text color.

98
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.320
So if I say something like paragraph called Color and make everything in sight of this something like

99
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.290
green then that will affect all the paragraphs regardless of where they are.

100
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:02.780
When you make this into a clear color let's say something like yellow and let's make this background's

101
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.490
blue and make this border color orange.

102
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.720
That way things are hopefully more clear for you to see.

103
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.120
All right.

104
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.610
So what I've done here is I changed the colors of the div background and border but I also said all

105
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.680
paragraph elements have the color yellow and notice I want to say all paragraph elements.

106
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.060
It doesn't matter whether they're inside the div or outside.

107
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.290
When I call something like this it specifically requests all paragraph elements regardless of where

108
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.450
they are.

109
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.000
Later I will show you how to select elements that are inside of divs and also a specific element type

110
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:46.000
so maybe only want to effect headings inside of a div or heading force inside of a specific div.

111
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.850
Then lastly I want to show you the span tag and the span allows us to grab anything within that span.

112
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.920
So remember it was these two words inside span.

113
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.430
So I will call background here

114
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:10.710
and say something like read and let's give it a color of black.

115
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:18.230
So now I save this and refresh over here I can see inside span is now background red color black.

116
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.550
All right.

117
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.280
So what do we learn.

118
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.840
So far we've learned the body div and Spanta x.

119
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.940
Hopefully now you realize you can basically call any female tag and start affecting its properties.

120
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.250
The properties we learned about so far are the background order and color properties.

121
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:40.250
Lastly I want to show you another case of background where you can actually set the background to be

122
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.970
an image.

123
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.390
So let me grab an image.

124
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.980
You can do this just by going to google images and then looking up whatever image you want.

125
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.660
So let's say I want a picture of a beach I can look up this right click here on this image.

126
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.420
Then I click view image and it takes me to this link right here.

127
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:07.250
So let me copy that full path and for background I'm going say not grey but I will actually call a special

128
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.420
key word your L in passen that it's higher your l.

129
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.060
So that's linking the background to this image.

130
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.560
So now I will save this Ambac undersea esus basics.

131
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:24.800
I will refresh and we can see here we get the if I expand this we get the whole beach image as the background

132
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.100
for the body if we want it we don't need to have it zoomed in like this.

133
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:38.920
We can specify various properties of this background image things for instance such as backgrounds repeats

134
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:44.390
or background no rips etc. so we can actually specify how many times we want it to repeat.

135
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.690
In our case the background image is so large that it's not going to make much of a difference because

136
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.280
I'm zoomed in.

137
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:56.920
But if I zoom out here you can begin to see that I have this background image I'm zoomed out right now

138
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.720
and I see that entire beach.

139
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:07.900
So if I want the background to repeat multiple times then under AP background Rippy I can say repeat

140
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.440
save that refresh this page and I can see now the background is being repeated.

141
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.820
All right.

142
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.300
So so far we have these kind of funky really 90s looking.

143
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.560
Tim L. sites.

144
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.320
Later on we're going to see how he can make these into much nicer.

145
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.520
Right now the point is to understand how CSSA works OK.

146
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.210
Do you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

147
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.750
I'll see you at the next lecture.
