00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.110
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we'll be discussing Django templates.

2
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.950
Templates are a key part of understanding how Django really works and interacts with your web site.

3
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.900
Later on we will learn about how to connect templates with models so that you can display data created

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.750
dynamically taken straight from your database.

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.010
However for now let's focus on the basics of templates and later on template tags.

6
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.260
The template will contain the static parts of NHT M-L page parts that are always the same.

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.190
You can think of it almost as the scaffolding or skeleton of the page.

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.950
Then there are a template text which have their own special syntax.

9
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.710
This syntax allows you to inject dynamic content that you're Django absentees will produce affecting

10
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.190
the final h Tamil that the user sees to get started with templates.

11
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.620
You first need to create a templates directory and then a subdirectory for each specific apps templates

12
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.930
or at least by convention.

13
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.900
That's how we're going to do it.

14
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.440
Here it goes inside of your top level directory.

15
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.780
So in our example we'll have something that looks like this.

16
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.000
The first project folder or directory then we'll create a new templates folder and inside of that we'll

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.130
have the first underscore app folder or that rectory.

18
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.070
The next step is let jinglin know of the templates by editing the D R key inside of the templates dictionary

19
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020
in the settings that py file.

20
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.670
So inside the settings py file for the project.

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.240
There is a variable called templates and it's a dictionary inside that dictionary is a string.

22
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.250
D i r which stands for directory and that's what we need to edit to let Django know where the templates

23
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.760
are.

24
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.920
However there is an issue with this that we have to deal with before we can actually edit that templates.

25
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.660
Variable we want our jingle project to be easily transferable from one computer to another.

26
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.970
But the DJR or directory key is going to really require a hard coded file path and that means we're

27
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.360
going to have a conundrum.

28
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:08.030
We can't really hard code a file path with our username if we want to easily share this project or application

29
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.220
with other users and then we have the whole issue of different operating systems.

30
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.260
Someone using a Mac isn't going to be able to use the same file path settings as someone using a Windows

31
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.070
computer.

32
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.770
So the question is how do we actually resolve this.

33
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.530
Well this is where the power of Python comes into play.

34
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.950
We can use Python's os module to dynamically generate the correct file path strings regardless of whose

35
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.030
ever computer you're using or whatever operating system you're using.

36
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.310
Do you want to check this out.

37
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.260
You can import os with Python and then try something like the following Prince underscore underscore

38
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.250
file underscore underscore or print OS that path.

39
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.040
Name and then pass that file tag.

40
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.620
And we're going to actually show you examples of this right.

41
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.440
We're done with this presentation but we're going to be using this os module to feed the path to the

42
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.290
DDR key inside of that template dictionary.

43
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.930
Once we have done that we can create H.T. a mail file called index storage DML inside of the templates

44
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.880
first app directory inside the this L file.

45
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.280
We will insert template tags along with normal h l these template tags are also sometimes known as Django

46
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.910
template variables.

47
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.310
These template variables will allow us to inject content into the HVM l directly from Django.

48
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.690
Now as a quick note these template tags can be a little intimidating for beginners and the reason for

49
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.020
that is because they don't look exactly like h T.M. and they don't look exactly like Python either because

50
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.450
of this new pseudo mix between the two.

51
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.480
So they're a little intimidating at first and you may find them confusing when you're first dealing

52
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.200
with them.

53
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.340
But don't worry we're going to be working with them often enough that by the end of this course you'll

54
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.820
feel really comfortable calling template tags.

55
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.080
So as a quick note Don't be intimidating if you see this thing come out of nowhere but we will have

56
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.070
a full understanding of template tags as we progressed through the course and we'll start off slow and

57
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.820
steady to get comfortable with them in your own time.

58
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.860
So this is now starting to really reveal the power of why we should even be using a web framework.

59
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.000
Will be able to inject content into the HMO much means we can later on use Python code to inject content

60
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.110
from a database which will learn about when we learn about models.

61
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.210
Django in order to achieve all of this what we will use is a new function called the render function

62
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.520
and place it into our original index function inside of our views that py file that we've been working

63
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.980
with.

64
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.170
So I know I've been talking a lot so let's now actually jump to the add on text editor and code through

65
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.820
everything that we just discussed.

66
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.960
Already here and back at the Adam text editor.

67
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.820
Now before we get started actually creating our templates what I want to do is quickly talk again about

68
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.670
those dynamic paths using Python's os module to actually generate dynamic paths so you don't have to

69
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.260
worry about giving the file to a computer that's on another operating system.

70
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.940
What we can do here is under first project first project.

71
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.070
Open up our settings that py file and you'll notice that actually at the top.

72
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.370
Import os has already been imported for you and there's a base directory and this basically builds the

73
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.770
paths inside of the project.

74
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.530
And if we actually just run this file we can explore what these file paths actually are.

75
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.860
So let's go ahead and do that.

76
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:28.050
We're going to change directory you first project that way am under first project first project and

77
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:36.730
then right now I will say Python settings stop PI enter and we shouldn't see any output because we're

78
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.480
not printing anything out.

79
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.620
So we can run it now it's actually print stuff out and explore what it actually is.

80
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.460
We'll start off with this file and this is essentially just a special key indicating the settings that

81
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.340
high file.

82
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.870
So if I save this and run it now I get settings that pi as my file output so that's the actual file.

83
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.800
And now let's print out this the O S path the absolute path to this.

84
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.680
So I can just copy and paste this from here.

85
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.360
Copy that and then paste it here saved this.

86
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.380
And now let's front that.

87
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.580
And here we can see it printed out my actual full file path.

88
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.540
So here and there see users my name desktop my jingoes stuff.

89
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.040
First project first project settings start pi.

90
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.230
And this is the sort of thing we're going to be using to actually feed and file paths.

91
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.800
So we will feed even directly from python instead of typing out something like this.

92
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.230
And then finally we can see what this base Diyar is.

93
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.870
So this whole thing has been set up as a variable already conveniently for us so we can use it later.

94
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.790
Willing to say this and then actually just print out base directory and we can see here when we print

95
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.040
out the base directory.

96
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.500
It prints out the directory that leads directly to the first project.

97
00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:01.340
So this most upper directory with this base underscore directory variable we can use it's conveniently

98
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.630
call our new templates directory that we're about to create.

99
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.800
Let's first create that directory and then show you how you can create the template directory under

100
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.060
the top directory of first project.

101
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:20.420
I will click and then add in a new folder and I will call this folder templates all lowercase.

102
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.810
And here you can see I have a new templates folder.

103
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.920
Right now it's empty.

104
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.450
And then I can use this base directory and add onto it templates.

105
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:37.220
Now you may be tempted to do something like this as a simple add on maybe backslash and then templates

106
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.200
but that's actually not going to work for many reasons.

107
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.190
One is stuff may be treated as an escape character and to this isn't going to work for all operating

108
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.820
systems.

109
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.750
If you are on a Linux or Mac maybe or forward slash will go the other way.

110
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.680
Etc. so what are you going to do is use OS stop path that joyn actually joined these two.

111
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:04.520
So we're going to put a comma here and now instead of calling Prince I will call O S path that join

112
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.490
and this will actually join these two together.

113
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:13.300
And let's show you what that looks like when I say print's going to save this and then run settings

114
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.430
that high again.

115
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.600
And here I can see the full directory for my local machine to that templates folder.

116
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:25.370
And in this case I'm not actually going to print this but actually save this as a new variable and this

117
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:33.340
variable is going to be called template underscore the IIR so templates underscore DJR sets the template

118
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.790
directory.

119
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.980
Let's save that and then we're going to edit the directories.

120
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:44.980
If we scroll down here still in the settings up-I going to go past the installed apps go past the middleware

121
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.740
and here under templates.

122
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.520
I'm going to passen for the directories so remember this is just essentially a dictionary type object.

123
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.630
Than the here's is key.

124
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:02.830
Rectories inside of it I will passen that template underscore the our variable we just made and we can

125
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.830
put in a comma there and then save this.

126
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:06.700
All right.

127
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.430
So here we have everything set up ready to go with the paths going to be concatenated correctly.

128
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.520
Let's move on to the next step of actually adding a template within our template directory.

129
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:30.530
We're going to Right-Click put in a new file and we will call this file index the HMO and inside of

130
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:36.410
this I will just put in my regular HTL code and we can set this title to be something like.

131
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.930
First app save that and then we're actually going to put in a little bit of information here in the

132
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.480
body.

133
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:53.390
We'll put in the header and say something like Hello this is indexed HMO save that and then we're going

134
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:59.430
to show you what a template looks like in to make it really obvious how it's going to work will give

135
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.550
it a name that makes it very clear.

136
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.840
So as far as syntax for a template tag or at least the very first thing we're going to do.

137
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:11.190
You have essentially two sets of these curly brackets on each side and then the actual variable.

138
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:17.580
You're going to passen in this case we'll call this variable inserts underscore me so that we can actually

139
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:23.340
see that we're inserting stuff using Django some going to say this again very simple 20:00 file except

140
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.870
there might be a little confusing is this template tag right now and don't worry if you find that a

141
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:33.120
little intimidating because it's kind of weird and new we will see this more and more as we go throughout

142
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.290
the course.

143
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:40.980
Now what we need to do is actually connect this variable insert me to our actual project and our application

144
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.670
and the way we're going to do that is by editing the views that py file of our first underscore app.

145
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:55.610
So we will come here to views that pi and here we have the index takes and a request returns and HTP

146
00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.340
response Hello World and said well we're going to do now is notice we have from Jingo that shortcuts

147
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.650
import render that should already be there by default but if you don't have it go ahead and type that

148
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.370
in.

149
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:15.090
And now what we will do is actually edit this function and we're going to say something like this will

150
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:25.470
say create a dictionary and we will call it my underscore dictionary or whatever you want to call it.

151
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.550
And then here this is the important part.

152
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.350
We'll have a key value pair.

153
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:35.410
And in this case we need this key to match the variable that we created over in that template tag.

154
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:42.320
So in that case it was insert me and we'll just have it be a string and say something like Hello I am

155
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.210
from use that pi

156
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.500
we will save that and then we're going to return.

157
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.150
And this is where we can actually use the render function.

158
00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.220
And in this case for the render function we're going to pass passen it takes in the request and then

159
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.660
it takes in as a string where you actually want to show this.

160
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.020
So again that first parameter is just really the template we wish to use.

161
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:15.800
And then the next thing I need to add in is the actual file itself indexed HVM el.

162
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.660
And then here as the third argument is the context and this good basically going to link up what we're

163
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.940
passing in here to our index is the mail file and we're actually going to change this in a little bit

164
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:32.060
we'll create a subdirectory but I'll explain that right after we test this out to make sure it all works.

165
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.940
So here shouldn't be a string will pass in that dictionary we just created and then we will save all

166
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.830
of this.

167
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.190
And let's actually make sure this all worked out and then we'll explain it and show you why you should

168
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.840
edit this just a little bit by actually referencing the specific application.

169
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.190
So let's run this.

170
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.470
Make sure all work out.

171
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.140
And then we're going explain and do a little quick review.

172
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.220
So I'm going to back up to see the.

173
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:06.260
Under first project they all say Python managed up-I run the server enter and looks like our servers

174
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.690
are running so let's just copy and paste this.

175
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.890
And as always I'll bring in my browser and then bringing in my browser over here.

176
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.460
Look who we get.

177
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.320
We say hello.

178
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.400
This is indexed.

179
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.340
H T.M..

180
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.860
And then we say hello I am from buse that pie.

181
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.880
So we have the original header that is from index that it's T.M..

182
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.080
We look at index that CML we would find it there and then we see this little message.

183
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.850
Hello I am from B is that PI.

184
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.020
So this is pretty much the amazing part of what we're doing here.

185
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.120
We're actually inserting using Jenga.

186
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:41.070
We say hello I'm from the used up pie and using that template tagging I can then pass that in.

187
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.130
Now a quick note.

188
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.700
Well we want to do is actually separate out our templates per application.

189
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:54.180
So what I should do is this under my templates I'm going to create a new folder and name it after my

190
00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:02.100
application first app and then I will move index each T.M. into first app and that way we keep our code

191
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.130
modular and the next thing I have to do is come back to use that pi.

192
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:14.290
And here I will call first underscore app and then actually call the index there.

193
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.600
And this slash should actually go the other way and this slash is OK to go that way because this is

194
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.190
basically what your browser is going to be reading.

195
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.970
So we will save that and let's check it again make sure everything works and let's go ahead and just

196
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.800
to make sure thing work change this.

197
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.330
So say something like.

198
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:40.400
Now I am coming from coming from first app

199
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.240
index.

200
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.110
Saved this.

201
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.810
And let's bring in that back that browser make sure all were.

202
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.790
And I just refreshed the page and now I see this one coming from first app index studied Simmo.

203
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.460
OK great.

204
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.650
Looks like everything worked out then our templates are good to go.

205
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.620
So let's break down everything we just did real quickly just so we get a fuller standing of how the

206
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.920
basics of templates work and when to minimize this.

207
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.210
Right.

208
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:13.460
First thing we had to do was create essentially our templates directory and inside that template directory

209
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:18.480
you should create the rectory for each application and then inside it that is where your actual All

210
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.860
files are going to go.

211
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.190
And later on we'll see how to incorporate things such as JavaScript and see SS because we've created

212
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.000
this templates directory.

213
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.730
We need to let settings that pi know about it and the way we did this is we took advantage of a couple

214
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.210
of things.

215
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:39.100
One was the import os and Python's operating system and then we had the template directory.

216
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.650
Now we use Python's OS module to say oh stop Hathout join and join the space directory to that templates

217
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:51.070
that we just created and you'll always want to use OS that path join instead of something more manual.

218
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.240
That way the code can run on any operating system.

219
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.510
Once we've done that we come back here two views and we learn how to use import render which is something

220
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.860
we're going to be using a lot more often than just a simple APCP response.

221
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.450
And then with the render function we can create a dictionary.

222
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.620
Now this dictionary is then going to have the actual content that we want to inject into that index

223
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:18.080
the amount it takes in the key and this key is going to be the variable that we pass into that template

224
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.580
Ted.

225
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.900
In this case we just called it insert me to make it really obvious.

226
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:28.780
And now here I say now and coming from Stapp index etc. and in the render pasand the request passen

227
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.120
the actually it's T.M..

228
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.240
And then for the context we pass in this dictionary and then it will read in the Keys when it actually

229
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.560
wants to inject stuff into this index that H.T. mail file.

230
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.200
All right.

231
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.960
Now I know that was certainly a lot in a lot of new things but don't worry as we continue on throughout

232
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.290
this course this is going to feel more and more comfortable for you.

233
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.960
OK.

234
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.370
Hope you enjoyed that lecture and we'll see you in the next one.
