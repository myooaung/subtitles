Hello everyone and welcome to h tim at level 2.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.520
We finally reached the level of a small section of the course and this section of the Course is really

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.470
going to focus on two topics tables and forms.

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.310
And overall it's going to consist of a lecture on tables then a table quiz basically allowing you to

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.400
practice tables T.M..

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.520
Then we'll talk about how to use forms with h t m l.

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.450
And finally have an assessment test at the end where you get to practice using forms with the Tamil.

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.090
Once we finish this section of course we're going to be ready to dive into CSSA to start styling each

9
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.420
T.M. and a quick note will h tim l may seem pretty basic and possibly boring at sometimes at first we

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.790
really needed to build a good foundation for our knowledge later on.

11
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.710
So you can think of this section almost as eating your vegetables before you get to go onto the main

12
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.750
course and then later on dessert OK let's go ahead and get started by talking about tables.

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.970
I'll see at the next lecture.
