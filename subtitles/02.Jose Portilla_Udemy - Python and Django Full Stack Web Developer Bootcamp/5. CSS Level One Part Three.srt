00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,390
Hello everyone and welcome to part three of CSSA level 1 a major part of what we've seen so far has

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,510
revolved around the idea of CSA selectors where selectors in general are used to target HVM elements

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,760
that we want the style so far we've only approached the idea of selecting HTL elements by their tags

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,800
so grab all paragraph tags or grab all lists tags.

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,800
But what if we only want to select subsets or select the single elements.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,110
That is where we can use selectors to clarify exactly what elements we want in each team T.M. we can

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,900
use IDs to target single elements and we can use classes to target groups of elements and then we can

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,020
also use a wide variety of combinations of selector tags to target certain combinations of elements

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,620
things such as descendents or adjacent siblings and we're going to talk a lot more about that.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,800
So let's jump right in to show how this all works.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,870
All right so here we have it.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,060
HVM male called Part 3 him and it's linked to Part 3 underscore mastery that CSSA and in the body of

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:11,620
this aist hymnal I'm going to add some content I'll add a heading theory that says Aima H-3 heading

14
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,010
and then I'm going to add some divs.

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,610
And now when it says class member auto completes class I will actually add some classes to this so I'll

16
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:31,590
call this first div class and we'll put a paragraph in here it says I'm inside the first class.

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,720
That way we can see what's going on when we actually begin to Selby's that I will add another division

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,630
container I will call this second div and in a paragraph.

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,460
All right.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,220
Inside the second div class

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:57,260
and then we'll add a little bit more I'm going to add a paragraph and with this paragraph we're going

22
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,840
to add an ID to it.

23
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,650
So out of the are we're going to set it equal to singled

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,030
And in this paragraph will say these must be unique.

25
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:22,470
Then we're going to make another heading three that says here's a list and you can also just copy and

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,740
paste this from the part 3 or 8.

27
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,820
If you don't want to type it all out yourself will have an unordered list.

28
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,490
I'll say something like.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,890
Confirm you can write whatever text you want in here.

30
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,990
And then I will say something like feedback.

31
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,150
Question mark and inside of these list elements we're also going to add inputs.

32
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,010
So the first input is going to just be a checkbox and put.

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:57,580
And the second input is going to be a text so checkbox really similar to a radio button that we've seen

34
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,960
earlier except in our case it's actually just a check box that you've probably seen before.

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,840
Online.

36
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,180
And then another list we're going to drop an anchor tag here and we'll give an address to our Web site

37
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:19,960
this website will be my web site Parian data dot com and we'll say higher data.

38
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,310
I know there's a lot of content so feel free to pause or just copy and paste from the notes and then

39
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:32,300
we'll put another anchor tag here that has an RF of some other Web site which is say npr.org or you

40
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,790
can put any news Web site you want here or really any web site.

41
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,220
Also it's NPR.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,700
All right.

43
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,650
Lots of stuff here.

44
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,560
So let's break it down real quick let's refresh this to make sure things are linked.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,850
Expand that a bit.

46
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,540
All right.

47
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,410
So right now I have this H-3 heading something that's inside the first day of class something that's

48
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,260
that side the second class.

49
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,770
They make sure I spelled that correctly.

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,510
Refresh this and then IDs must be unique or ID.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,850
We have here is a list conferred with a checkbox on it that we can click on and off feedback with some

52
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,370
text input here.

53
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,610
Then two links here Paria data and NPR.

54
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,200
All right.

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,650
We have all of this.

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,160
So now let's jump to CSX and actually talk about how we can link to this.

57
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,740
So notice here they have classes.

58
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,150
And then my idees.

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,370
So if I come to my C Ss and I say something like DIVX and I specify the color of all divs to be read

60
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,210
and then I come back here and I refresh this no matter where the div is no matter what class it is as

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,090
long as it has the tag it is going to be the color red.

62
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,820
So first div becomes red.

63
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,170
Second div becomes red.

64
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,440
Normally however you don't want to affect every single tag that has.

65
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,900
Did you want to select subsets.

66
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:58,580
In that case we can use these classes that we assigned so I can select first or second div instead of

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,480
selecting everything that's inside.

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,560
And he did.

69
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,030
And that's the key to using classes.

70
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:11,980
Now what you can't do if a class is just say first div and then color something blue.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,880
Otherwise if I refresh this.

72
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,390
Notice no change occurs when you're dealing with a class.

73
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,780
You tell CSSA that it's a class through a dot.

74
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,490
So classes always start with a dot or a period.

75
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,020
So now if I save this refresh over here I can see that I'm inside the first class has now become blue.

76
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:38,670
And likewise I can grab the second do and color that red.

77
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,730
Refresh this.

78
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,760
And I can see now inside the first class inside second class are there own individual color.

79
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,240
So this is a very common tool to use and this is where we're getting in today of selectors.

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,720
So for classes the always start of this for this period.

81
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,310
OK.

82
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,120
Now we noticed that we also had an I.D. and for IDS one I.D. to be unique.

83
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,500
It just is attached to a single element versus classes can be attached to multiple elements so for an

84
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,470
I.D. It's usually just a single element.

85
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,190
Classes can be across multiple divisions multiple centers multiple paragraphs etc..

86
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,870
Classes use a hash tag so shift number three.

87
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,100
There's a hashtag Lehre.

88
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,190
And then we put in the name of the class which in our case was singled out.

89
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,900
Now we can see that also the syntax highlighting tells you oh you're doing a class here.

90
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,890
Let me double check that it's singled out.

91
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,510
There it is.

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,070
Unless change is something to Kolar let's say green

93
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,410
Now let's also give it an it's something called a text decoration text decoration.

94
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,230
I'm just going to kind of throw this in.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,830
These are things such as over lines under lines or like a strike through a line through.

96
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,250
So we'll give that a line through.

97
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,960
Save it.

98
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,710
Let's refresh or can see here we see IDs must be unique.

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,730
Is now the color green.

100
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,380
And also has a line through.

101
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,110
So there we're kind of just throwing in a little tune on both how to use IDS and the fact that you can

102
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,870
use text declarations as another property and you can always use the CSSA references and the notes for

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,860
various properties if you're looking for them.

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:22,080
And other common thing actually not common sorry is the Asterix the Asterix is a selector for selecting

105
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,990
every element on the page.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,150
So if I say color elements and then say black I save this and refresh is going to color everything black

107
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,320
and it's going to overwrite certain things.

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,270
It won't override IDs but you can see here that it's overwriting these class calls this asterisks call

109
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,830
tries to overwrite as much as it can over all the elements.

110
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,510
A quick note though.

111
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,590
This is actually very uncommon usually don't want to just call everything like this.

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,750
Maybe if you want something like a background but it's usually pretty uncommon to just call an asterix

113
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,000
there.

114
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,240
Although I do want you to be aware or you can use an asterix to select all the elements in the page

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
HTML.

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,390
However it will be overwritten if they have a particular ID.

117
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,820
All right.

118
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Finally I want to discuss a few different types of selectors.

119
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,680
You can check out the links in the actual CSSA file if you're interested in more of these.

120
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,180
And I have the link open here in a nother tab but basically here is a CSA selector reference and you

121
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,430
can actually call elements on many many types of selectors.

122
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,990
So there's a huge list here of the various types of selectors and I want to show you a few examples

123
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,110
of the more common ones.

124
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,430
So far we've seen things like class like Dot class hash tag ID Asterix to select all the elements and

125
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,400
then certain elements like just calling the element tag.

126
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:44,820
All right.

127
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,950
Let's show an example of one of those CSSA selectors known as adjacent siblings and that has to do with

128
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,200
elements that are next to each other.

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,830
Let's imagine that I wanted to select all unordered list items that are next to an H-3 heading 3.

130
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:06,780
I would do this I'd say heading 3 and then I use the plus operator unordered lists curly braces and

131
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,190
then whatever property I wanted.

132
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:17,370
So let's give them a border and we can do border border style and border thickness all in one line.

133
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:25,650
So instead of saying like we've done before border color and then order with and then border style I

134
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,080
can actually just call border by itself.

135
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,640
Pasan a thickness.

136
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,870
So let's give it four pixels then give it a style let's say it's the dotted style and then give it a

137
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,750
color let's give it purple and that's kind of a quicker nicer way to create borders.

138
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,830
So I'll save this refresher page here.

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,590
And now I can see that any unordered list that is next to an H3 now has this border.

140
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,120
So that's known as adjacent siblings and you can always reference here on the links in this SS file

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,140
for the notes the various different types of CSSA selectors.

142
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:08,980
So in our case this plus basically says Select all unordered list elements that are placed immediately

143
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,690
after an H-3.

144
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,180
OK there are two more CSSA selectors that I want to cover for this lecture and one of them is known

145
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,030
as descendants.

146
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,180
And the other one is for attributes.

147
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,370
So for the students It basically looks like this.

148
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,990
If we want to grab all anchor tags that are inside a list you just put a space between them so all the

149
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,500
tags inside of a list and then we can affect them.

150
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,360
So let's give them a color let's say something like red.

151
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,950
So my colon there refresh our page and we can see now that any anchor tag that's inside a list now has

152
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,250
the color red.

153
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,600
And then the last one I want to show you is how to actually effect attributes.

154
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:58,520
So let's say you want to go further than this and actually grab any anchor Ted inside of a list with

155
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:06,750
a particular ref and actual link that it can use square brackets for this and say Atra here equal to

156
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,500
the libido E.W..

157
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:16,520
Now let's go with the last one which was npr.org or whatever website you happen to put in there.

158
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,020
We'll give it a color.

159
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,390
Let's just give it the color something like blue and let's give it a Borders.

160
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,320
Let's practice using that border again.

161
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,540
Remember you just give it a thicknesse such as five pixels.

162
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,710
The style looks give it the style solid and then some color.

163
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:44,380
Let's give it orange save this refresh our page and we can see now we selected any anchor tag with this

164
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,160
particular ref inside of a list and changes color and it's border.

165
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,570
All right.

166
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,040
So that's really all there is for these particular CSA selectors.

167
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,480
They're at the course the most common ones we're going to be dealing with are really class selectors

168
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,410
and Id selectors.

169
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,280
Well we will show various things such as Jason's siblings or the ascendence attributes et cetera these

170
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,170
throughout our course are going to be less commonly used just because we won't be really focusing on

171
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,720
those type of my new details we're learning.

172
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,660
We will really more focused on classes and ideas so make sure you really know these two types.

173
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,870
Right classes.

174
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,530
Hash tag for IDs.

175
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,080
OK.

176
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,630
And if you ever want to reference the various other type to see selectors just open up the CSSA file

177
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,980
and it has links to the SS reference selector pages.

178
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,890
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
