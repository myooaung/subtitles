00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:10,280
Hello everyone and welcome to the set up in instillation lecture before we get started.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,000
I wanted to note that there are many options for choosing your development environment and your browser.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,860
In this course we're going to be using the Adam text editor and Google Chrome if you're very experienced.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,030
Another idea that's an integrated development environment.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,070
Feel free to go ahead and use it.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,050
Maybe you already have a lot of experience with the subline text editor or high charm.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,390
That's totally ok.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,020
Feel free to use whatever feels comfortable for you.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,120
If you already have a lot of experience of a certain ID although I still highly recommend you try out

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,970
Adam I've learned to really enjoy it and it works really well.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,120
It's all the material in this course as far as the browser choice goes.

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,140
We do ask that you please use Chrome.

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,760
It is by far the most popular choice for web developers and I also want to make sure that the sites

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,260
that I run in this course will also run on your computer.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,740
Again in this lecture we're going to show you where you can install Adam text editor from and give you

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,870
a quick tour of it.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,980
Let's get started.

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,400
Go to Google in your browser.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,240
OK so in your browser if you don't have google chrome.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,040
What you should do is go to Google dot com slash chrome or just google search for the term Google Chrome

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,870
and eventually you'll find this page right here which is Gool about com slash Chrome.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,220
There may be a bunch of information about their Chrome books which are their physical products.

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,310
What we really want is just Google Chrome itself so you can click here on download click for personal

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,920
computers and then click on the download link for the web browser.

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,760
OK.

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,190
So that's making it Google Chrome.

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,450
It's just a web browser.

28
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,570
I'm sure many of you are or most of you are already familiar with it then to actually get the text editor

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,920
for this course go to atom.

30
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,830
Io that's 80 m dot.

31
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,050
Oh and this is the Adam text editor that we're using for the course.

32
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:01,890
And the reason we use Adam text editor is because it can support across platforms that OS X Windows

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,550
Linux.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,660
It has a built in package manager so you can search for and install new packages.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,290
You can even create your own packages and plug ins all from within atom.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,570
It has smart auto completion that will be using a lot during the course file system browser multiple

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,190
panes find replace features has a lot of stuff that we're going to be using often throughout the course.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,680
Now other text editors also have these exact same features so Adam is not unique in these aspects.

39
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,260
But it works really well for what we're going to be doing for the course.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,410
The main reason I really like Adam though is if you scroll all the way down there's two really interesting

41
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,300
things about it.

42
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,990
The first thing that I really like is that it's totally open source so it's totally free it's open source

43
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,330
and if you really want to make a change to the Adam text editor you can make a contribution and help

44
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,960
improve.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,570
Adam text editor and then the second thing which is kind of more of a curiosity slash really interesting

46
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,800
aspect of it is that atom itself is actually built with a lot of the front end technologies are we in

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,510
this course it runs with h tim l javascript CSSA and a javascript library called node.

48
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,170
Yes.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,000
And then it runs all that on a framework called electron which allows you to use web technologies actually

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,190
build desktop applications.

51
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,620
So that's just a little side fact we won't be dealing with electron at all in this course but maybe

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,150
after you've done taking this course you're interested in developing desktop applications will you'll

53
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,950
be able to use a lot of the skills in this course to build something like atom.

54
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,380
So that's just a quick side note to actually install Adam.

55
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,730
It's quite simple.

56
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,990
Just click here on the installation button.

57
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,790
If you're on Windows this will download an executable file.

58
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,820
You just double click it.

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,570
Run through the installation process.

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,260
If you're on a Mac OS this will be something like a dmg file again.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,020
Double click it.

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,210
Run through the installation process and then if you're on Ubuntu I believe it's a tar file that you

63
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,210
can just then unpack.

64
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,140
OK so let me hop over to the Adam text editor and show you what it looks like.

65
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,000
OK so once you've opened Adam for the first time you should see a welcome guide and this is just a really

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,300
useful guide for you.

67
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,030
It has a bunch of information about the various features of ADOM such as how to open a project install

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,560
a package choose a theme.

69
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,780
If you don't like the default color theme you can just click here on choose a theme and then open the

70
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,720
theme picker and then check the other themes out.

71
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,960
You can even customize the styling and you can do anything with SS that we learned later on in this

72
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,360
course.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,710
That's pretty cool as well.

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,770
And then you can actually add snippets.

75
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,340
Learn keyboard shortcuts.

76
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,500
I would recommend you check out these keyboard shortcuts.

77
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,730
I'll be telling you the most useful ones as we continue throughout the course but the main thing I want

78
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,530
to show you is how to open a project.

79
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,080
So if you click on open a project will open a file open her see just click open a project here and then

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,890
you can select any folder you want.

81
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,580
So hopefully by now you've downloaded the files that go of this course and then you can just add that

82
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,750
select that folder and add it to the actual file path.

83
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,230
So let me show you what that looks like.

84
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,510
I'll just select this folder right here.

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,920
And here it can see.

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,260
I've selected a folder Django lecture's has some files in it.

87
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,200
If you want to open a file you just click on it and then it opens up the file itself.

88
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,500
And here you can see I have some H-2 him all code and that's basically we're going to be doing throughout

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,580
the rest of the course.

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,990
We're just going to be running through your project folders and then adding files here.

91
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,930
And if you ever want to collapse this directory all you have to do is do command or control backslash

92
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,840
and then you can open and close that.

93
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,120
All right so that's the very basics of Adam.

94
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,910
That's really all you need to know throughout the rest of the course.

95
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,110
We're going to be showing you more and more features of Adam and then playing around a lot more.

96
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,180
OK thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.
