00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.760
Hello everyone and welcome to the CSSA level on assessment solution's lecture and this lecture will

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.240
just be cutting out the solutions for the sea level one assessment.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.450
Let's get started.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.410
OK so here I am at my editor and I'm going to just zoom in a little bit so you can see what I'm typing.

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.140
But the first task was to give the body element of the site a light blue background using some sort

6
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.170
of hex code.

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.680
So I should this a little bit in the last lecture but you would call body and then background color

8
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.320
and you would use color picker to actually grab some sort of hex codes so if you come over here to Google

9
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.750
clicking open this new tab I have color picker open and color ticker will just give you some sort of

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500
hex color so really any light blue colors fine.

11
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.220
Did he really have to be light blue.

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.590
I just want to make sure you had the ability to set the background colors for refresh us.

13
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.390
Now I see I have a light blue background color.

14
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.210
Great.

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300
So now task number two change the H-1 to have a one pixel solid black border.

16
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.740
So it will grab the heading one tag all Colborne all color border and then it will give it a 1 pixel

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.530
solid black border.

18
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.180
Save that.

19
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.570
Hit refresh over here.

20
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.920
Now I can see you walk into my free bar has that border OK.

21
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.000
Test Number three make all H-2 elements the color purple.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.310
So what I'm going to do is just simply grab H-2 and set the color to purple pretty straight forward

23
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.020
so far so I can see all these two elements.

24
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.780
What does it say for log into your save etc. Now task for ask for is make all input boxes have a two

25
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.250
x solid dark red a border now also mentions to use our IGB for this.

26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.260
So let's do that.

27
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.050
I'm going to say input

28
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:06.770
called border and then say to X solid and then set up a color here I'm going to call in RG B code and

29
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.440
they it really matter exactly what color you used but 1 4 4 0 0 is what I used for my solid dark.

30
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.430
I refresh this.

31
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.230
I can see now on these inputs I have this solid dark border task number five was to give a yellow light

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.210
yellow background to all paragraph elements inside of a div elements and use HEX for the color.

33
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.600
So remember we wanted to do something that has to do a little bit with inside an element so you call

34
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.920
div space p.

35
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.640
And that's going to call all the elements inside of a div and then you want to call the background to

36
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.820
be hash tag and then some sort of hex code.

37
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.440
So in this case I found this hex code.

38
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.830
You don't have to match my hex code exactly.

39
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.390
So we refreshed this.

40
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.980
You can see now we were affected.

41
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.410
Any P that's inside of a div.

42
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.060
Great.

43
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.510
So task number 6.

44
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.800
So there is a text area element with the ID text block and I want you to give it the following properties.

45
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.500
A five pixel solid gray border and the width of a hundred X and a height of 400 pics.

46
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.060
So I know we didn't actually go over width and height specifically but hopefully now you're able to

47
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.500
either use Google or use Adam's help that's built into the text editor.

48
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.890
So actually kind of answer these questions for yourself.

49
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.580
So we will say hash tag text block and you can see already it's starting to help us here.

50
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.320
So hash tag text block I'll grab the border or set it to a 5 pixel solid gray border and then for with

51
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.670
if I start typing w you'll see that it actually helps me out here.

52
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:56.000
I want the width to be a hundred pixels and I want the heights to be 400 pixels so like I mentioned

53
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.710
there's a ton of properties here and all you have to do is really just either search for width and height

54
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.400
is or use Adam text editor to help you out there.

55
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.910
If you're still having trouble actually discovering these on your own don't worry that's what the solutions

56
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.390
video is for.

57
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.190
All right.

58
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.060
Task number 7 let's just refresh make sure that actually took effect.

59
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.270
OK.

60
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.300
There it is.

61
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.470
So task number 7 there is a link to Google on the page make this link read.

62
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.070
So if we know there's a link then we know it must be an anchor tag and if we look at this Web site there's

63
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.830
actually only one link here that says Take it to Google.

64
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.940
So what I can do is just call all anchor tags and then make the color red send off I refresh this on

65
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.260
notice here take it to Google and read.

66
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.730
All right.

67
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.780
Task number eight is to make elements of the ID item one have an overlying text decoration and be the

68
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.740
color purple.

69
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.130
We talked about text decoration in the section.

70
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.180
We did a show Overleigh line but we did show how to create a single text decoration.

71
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.350
So first off we want an I.D. which means I need a call.

72
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.540
Item 1 again Adam helping us out there and the text decoration.

73
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:14.860
I wanted was an overlying and the other thing I want is to make the color purple so we will make that

74
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.750
color purple save this refresh over here and I can see line right here.

75
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.620
Number one take in text input has an overlay on it.

76
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.900
Task number line 9.

77
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.360
The last one before the bonus was make the elements of the class label X it have the background of blue

78
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.260
and a 4 per pixel that yellow border.

79
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.750
So for classes remember that's a dot.

80
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.530
So I say dot or period.

81
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:51.670
And then I want the background color to be blue and then I want the border to be a four pixel dashed

82
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.640
yellow border.

83
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.900
So I'm going to save this whoops save that refresh over here and I can see it on here.

84
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.810
Even though it looks very ugly we now have a background color blue and a dashboard of yellow.

85
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.870
And then finally the bonus challenge is there's a link to Google on that page and the list and you figure

86
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.670
out how to change the color if you click on the link.

87
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.090
And we had to do was Google this term CSSA visited.

88
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.850
And if you're able to discover through your Googling skills all you have to do is call anchor tag colon

89
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.460
and then visited and you can see here that Adam text editor is actually helping us out so it matches

90
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:37.210
links that have been visited and then we will call the color blue.

91
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.810
So we'll save that refreshes page to see our changes.

92
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.390
Now we can see since I've actually already visited Google before take you to Google is now colored blue

93
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.830
instead of just red.

94
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.900
All right.

95
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.220
So hopefully you are able to get the majority of those.

96
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.720
Don't worry if you aren't able to get the task 10.

97
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.030
And also don't worry too much.

98
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.370
If you had trouble with coming back up here which and high hope you're able to figure those out.

99
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.440
But again I know that was new for you.

100
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.650
So don't sweat it too much if you aren't able to get those on your first try.

101
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.590
Do you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

102
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.470
But that's it for CSSA level 1.

103
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.840
Thanks everybody and I'll see you at the next section CSSA level.
