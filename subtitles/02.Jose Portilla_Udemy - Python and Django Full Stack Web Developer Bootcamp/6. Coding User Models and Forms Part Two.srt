00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:11,120
Hello everyone and welcome back to part two of coding out the user models to actually fit the registration

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,480
part of this project.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,870
What we need to do is start working with the team else so those templates we're going to do is come

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:24,860
over here to templates create a new folder we'll call it basic underscore app to match name for application

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,800
and then under this I'm going to create a new file.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,970
Now call it base h T.M..

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,610
So it's going to be the base H.T. mail that we will be inheriting from or create in other new file and

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,810
we'll call this index.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:47,300
H team L that will be the actual index page then we'll create one new file and this will be registration.

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,220
H T.M..

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,700
So the registration page and then we haven't talked about it yet but after someone's registered they're

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,000
going to want to log in and log out of the page.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,050
So we'll create a new file called log in.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,980
H t l and we won't work with that right now.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,380
We'll have another discussion about logging and logging out.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,760
But right now I want to work on these three main files base index studies T.M. and registration and

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
once you've them that we'll also edit the Urals up high file at the project and create your Allsopp

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,580
profile for a basic application.

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,620
Well let's start off with the base which is going to have everything we need for the project.

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,840
So the first thing on the base page html page we don't have that open restriction.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,220
Basically Sammael page let me collapse this so I get a little more room is type HTL and let all the

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,770
automatic input and we would just call this base for the title actually won't give it anything because

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,820
we don't want to inherit the title block there.

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,510
You could make another block for a title block and then inherit everything kind of separately the head

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,400
and the body.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,500
That's totally a normal thing to do.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,860
But we won't focus on that until we actually get to the clone projects because we don't care too much

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,090
about looking good.

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,260
Right now what I'm going to say is pass in the bootstrap I mention we don't care about looking good

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,830
but we want to look a little bit good.

31
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,770
So it hasn't bootstrap and then I'm going to create a bar on this page just so we can quickly jump to

32
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,450
links on the page.

33
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,200
So this nav bar.

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:31,810
It's going to be with the class equal to nav bar space nav bar dasht default space nav bar bash static

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,670
the top.

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,460
Then after that going to make a div and that's going to be inside of a container class and then after

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,860
that loops then after that I'm going to create a unordered list.

38
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,800
And that's going to contain all the links.

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,270
So this unordered list is going to have a class of NAV space.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,850
Now Barbash nav and you can always copy and paste this from the notes.

41
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,880
If you don't want to watch me code this whole thing out.

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,570
So inside this unordered list are going to be the actual links to the other pages on the site.

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,650
So create three anchor tags and these anchor tags are going to have a class equal to either nav bar

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,160
brand or nav bar that links all say nav bar.

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,140
That brand will have this link back to the actual home page.

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,590
So we'll use template tagging for this.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,640
Hopefully remember from the template tagging lectures that we can just type in your l and then index.

48
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,470
If we set up their view or the you are up high file properly we haven't actually set the URLs up by

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,670
file so we'll have to do that and make sure it matches these.

50
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,820
RFE RL template calls but I will have here be the actual text say something like Django or home or whatever

51
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,530
you want.

52
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,580
And then we'll create another list in other anchor tag.

53
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:59,060
And this is going to be of a class as well will say class and this anchor tag is equal to NAV bar dash

54
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,160
link and I'm going to copy and paste this because we're going to see it again right below to link to

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,870
another page on the site.

56
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:13,850
So this will be the adamant site and let's make this be the register site.

57
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,620
So for the actual registration then what we will do here is say under Tref

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,590
create a URL tag and make sure have the percent signs up here as well.

59
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:35,400
For the index page there we go under Atra here will say your old template that looks for basic app

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,360
and then what it returns is whatever is named the register you.

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,500
And then here we're going to say the same thing we'll call your L and then we'll say.

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,860
Adam in and then passen index.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
All right so basically what we did is we set up a nav bar on the base.

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,120
Each T.M. and it links back to the home page with chain go links back to the admin page and then links

65
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,700
to the registration page which we haven't actually created yet.

66
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,010
So we will in just a second.

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,470
Later on when we talk about log in we'll show how we can use template tagging to add a Fourthly that

68
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,670
will either say log in or log out the pending on what the user is doing.

69
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:33,210
But after all of this outside of the nav bar what I want to do is say simply tagging Crit. a block all

70
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,640
this block the body block

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,580
and then I will also say and block

72
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,240
and anything inside of this we'll just put them into a container.

73
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,460
So for the other pages everything that's going to be there will be inside a container.

74
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,700
Obviously that's optional.

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,270
But for now this should work for us for a baseline age T.M..

76
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,420
Now let's focus on the other files such as the home page so the home page is just going to extend from

77
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,760
that.

78
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:13,270
So we'll say extends basic underscore app slash based HVM bill.

79
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,080
And I've noted a lot that you have to make sure the very first line in any age female file is this doc

80
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,640
type H HVM L.

81
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,410
The reason I can just say extends here is because if I extend this properly the very first line should

82
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,290
be doctype HTL and the second line will be T.M. et cetera.

83
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,940
Sometimes if you're a little paranoid you can always just copy paste this onto the first line to doublecheck

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
although you have it twice doctype doctype.

85
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,420
But just make sure that it's the top at the base h t m l at the very first line is extends and that

86
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,600
should work fine as well.

87
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,190
Up next one actually called the body block that we made.

88
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:59,940
So we'll say block and then body underscore block and then we will say div Jumbotron.

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:09,050
I tend to really like jumbo trons and will say Shingo level five is the home page.

90
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,430
And then what we're going to do is continue on by calling the end block.

91
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,720
So I will say and block right here.

92
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,470
And the Block saved that.

93
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,900
And now let's move on to the registration page.

94
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,630
So we have registration and what's going to happen here is we also are going to extend going to say

95
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,680
extends

96
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,810
from basic app slash based HVM L and then I'm going to set up the actual registration form that's on

97
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,660
the page.

98
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,430
So we're going to look a little bit different but usually you're going to want to import some files.

99
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,330
So maybe we want to import or load static files.

100
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,260
We don't really have any.

101
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,610
But just to show you what this would typically look like if you have static files maybe you want to

102
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,480
import some images like welcome to the page like your brand image or whatever on your registration page.

103
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:14,870
Typically you would need to load those static files in and then we're going to call block body block

104
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:24,320
and whenever you do that you also want to call in and end the block and now let's actually put in the

105
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,960
form so I'll say div this is a jumbotron.

106
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,350
And what we're going to do is have some logic here.

107
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,150
And the logic is going to look like this and this will make more sense when we talk about the views

108
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,130
and the context dictionaries we return.

109
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:49,870
But it's going to say if registered me in the context dictionary it returns something that says registered

110
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:59,050
because I have an if I want to make sure I have an end if so I'll say if registered this person is going

111
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:09,400
to say thank you or the site is going to say thank you for registering exclamation mark because I have

112
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,970
an if I can have an LCR I will say.

113
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,130
Else this person is not registered.

114
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,560
Then we're going to actually display the Himmel for registration which is something like register here

115
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,890
and let's pass on the actual file we'll say fill out the form

116
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,960
and then we need to make the form using template tagging.

117
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,150
So first we want to have the actual form.

118
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,720
We don't need a class and we don't need an action we can take care of that later.

119
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,610
But we do want to make sure that the method is equal to post and because we're using multimedia data

120
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,480
that we're uploading such as the image file we just say E and C type is equal to.

121
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,860
And we're going to say multipart form data.

122
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,920
So make sure you have that.

123
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,950
Otherwise the image uploading won't work.

124
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,620
So we can have that and usually you want the method to be last.

125
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,390
Although that doesn't actually affect it just for readability.

126
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,120
Having this is more common.

127
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:21,010
And then we're going to do is call an R C S R token C SRF underscore token and then call in the parts

128
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:27,750
of the form Zoomer that former created we can say a user form as underscore the that's the base user

129
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,430
form is going to ask for if we go back to the forms that come without.

130
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,260
Member user forum we're asking for the user name to email the password that we need to call the user

131
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,800
profile info form for the portfolio site and their profile pic.

132
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,660
So coming back to registration and then once we grab those attributes from the bases or form I'm going

133
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,240
to also want to grab stuff from my profile form as underscored.

134
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,190
And this term user underscore form and profile underscore form.

135
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,520
Those are going to be defined within the context dictionary of the views.

136
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,620
So we haven't actually done that yet.

137
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,090
So that type in an input is going to be a Samit type doesn't need to have a name but it does want to

138
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,550
have a values will say register and that's the end of our form.

139
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,670
So pretty simple so far.

140
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,200
So we will save this.

141
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,250
And what we've done so far this lecture is set up three main Tim L files.

142
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:25,310
We set up our base the H team l file has a nav bar which has the links with the morals on them and then

143
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,340
it also has the body blocks the index page.

144
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,800
This is just the home page not much here except for Welcome to jingle level 5 essentially and then registration

145
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,850
that each team L which has the tokens user forms and profile forms.

146
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,080
So these are things from the user sending back the context dictionary that we haven't actually worked

147
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,840
with yet before we actually conclude this lecture.

148
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Let's set up the Oreilles not py files to match up.

149
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,680
And then in the next lecture we'll actually talk more about the registration and what the views that

150
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,310
py files are going to look like.

151
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,540
So let's start by jumping to the actual project that PI file to have opened here.

152
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,010
We'll scroll down and set everything up.

153
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:10,000
So what I want to do is say import your L now will also import include import admen and then I want

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,870
to say from basic underscore at import views.

155
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,840
Now we haven't worked out all the views that py file in fact if we take a look at it it's totally empty.

156
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,380
But so far this is going to be a bunch of functions that we need to fill out later.

157
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,470
So right now we'll kind of assume the names of those functions and then work backwards to them.

158
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:36,070
Let's set up the home page and that's pretty easy every time we'll set up your el and then using regular

159
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,670
expressions.

160
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:47,500
I just want to say just the domain name Buzkashi index and we'll give it the name index.

161
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,240
Let's set up a couple of more views.

162
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,890
We'll set up the admin page to be your L up.

163
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,940
That's actually what is set up for us.

164
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,630
Never mind.

165
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,680
Let's set up your l.

166
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:05,750
Anything that has to do with basic app so we'll say our Here here basic underscore app slash and then

167
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,550
I'm going to call include the basic underscore app.

168
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,750
You are else OK.

169
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,700
And then we'll talk about logging in and logging out later on.

170
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,330
But these three views should work for now and if we come over to our basic app it doesn't have a girl's

171
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:33,010
up-I file yet that will match up to include here so let's create it will say basic app you file your

172
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,990
Alstott pie and let's actually do the Urals PI file for application.

173
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,960
Firstly you say from Django.

174
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:55,340
C o f dot you are else import Yoro and then we'll say from basic app and poor views.

175
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:02,680
Again you can just say from Daut import use up to you and since we're using template tagging or I should

176
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,450
say template your Elle's number we need to set up the app name variable.

177
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,090
So here say something like.

178
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,760
App name is equal to and then it has to match the actual application name not cases basic up and create

179
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:25,100
some of your patterns and the patterns we are going to create is one for someone who's about to register.

180
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:33,980
So we'll say our car register slash dollar sign and then this we'll call views and will have a function

181
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,180
in there called register.

182
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,460
We haven't made it yet but we'll create it in a little bit and then we'll say register there.

183
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,650
So we'll add more to this later on but this should be a nice cutting off point.

184
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,610
So let's quickly review everything we did.

185
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,270
We set up base HD mail in the mail and registration that reached him L..

186
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,310
And those are linking to the actual contex dictionary so we're going to return back.

187
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,380
We will work with the views that PI file.

188
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,110
Then we also set up the basics of our year olds up-I for both the project and the application.

189
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
We're not done with them yet.

190
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,550
We'll still add more stuff to them.

191
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,770
When we talk about working up the logon page but now coming up next is the majority of the work and

192
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,650
a lot of it happens right here with the views that PI file.

193
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,300
So thanks everyone for watching and I'll see in the next lecture where we talk about the use of high

194
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,430
file and setting up the registration here.
