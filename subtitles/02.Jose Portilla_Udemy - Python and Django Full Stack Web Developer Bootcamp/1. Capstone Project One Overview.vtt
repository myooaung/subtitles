Hello everyone and welcome to the capstone project one section of the course.

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
We've learned a lot about T.M. and CSSA two major components of any Web site.

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
And I want to congratulate you for making it this far into the course before we move on to bootstrap

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.150
which is actually going to simplify a lot of our work with CSSA.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.500
Let's take a moment to practice everything we've learned so far with a quick capstone project.

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.930
You're going to be creating a mock landing page for a startup in the landing page will have a form and

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.450
lead to a thank you page.

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.550
It's a pretty simple page but it will help you practice what we learned about HTL and CSA so far.

9
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
However I want you to know that this project is optional and there are really three ways you can approach

10
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.470
it.

11
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.880
The first way is if you already feel confident in each team Ellen CSSA.

12
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.420
Maybe you've already studied them or you just wanted a quick refresher So you saw a few lectures in

13
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.840
the last few sections or maybe you already knew them completely.

14
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.220
You can feel free to just skip this project and move on straight to bootstrap or whatever sections you

15
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.870
want to continue to or as a second option.

16
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.010
You can just follow along with the solution videos instead of trying the project on your own first and

17
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.410
then the third way to go about this project is to try to recreate the landing page before watching any

18
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.560
of the walkthrough solutions videos.

19
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.540
So again feel free to skip it just for a solution videos or recreate it and then watch the solution

20
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.990
videos.

21
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.330
It's totally up to you OK.

22
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.110
Let's take a quick look at the landing page.

23
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.190
See the requirements and then you can get started and decide what you want to do.

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.580
All right so here I am at the landing page.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.410
This is the welcome to the landing page where a startup that does something.

26
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.890
We have two paragraphs of lordship some and then it says sign up for our upcoming launch and at the

27
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.570
bottom we see a form that asks for your first name the last name and email and then it has a signed

28
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.500
me up button.

29
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.030
So what I want to do is to recreate this landing page.

30
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.730
It has a heading 1 heading to two paragraphs and then at the bottom.

31
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.860
We have this form that asks for your first name last name email so make sure you use the proper form

32
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.020
tags for going to be building this and we have a kind of a giant submit button that says Sign me up.

33
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.200
And note that it also has rounded corners so see if you can figure out how to do that.

34
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.780
Also note that it's colored The last thing I want to point out is using some C Ss.

35
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.010
We've been able to add a bit of a border to this on the left right hand side of the text content and

36
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.050
also on the bottom but not at the top.

37
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.260
See if he can figure out how to do that as well.

38
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.530
And then lastly if you actually fill out the information and then put some random email address there.

39
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.950
Upon hitting sign me up it should take you to some sort of think Page.

40
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.640
So thanks for signing up I'll reach out to you soon and we see that kind of border around the text.

41
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.390
All right see if he can recreate this really simple landing page.

42
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.120
So again it's just this landing page and then upon clicking the sign up button it should take some sort

43
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.480
of think you've got a system file that you have separately there.

44
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.190
Do you have any questions feel free to post in the Q&amp;A forums.

45
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.850
But again feel free to either skip this follow along with just the solution videos or try it out on

46
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.610
your own first and then watch the solutions video.

47
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.780
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
