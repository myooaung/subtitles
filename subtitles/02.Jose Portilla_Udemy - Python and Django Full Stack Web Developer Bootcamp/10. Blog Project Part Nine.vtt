00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.990
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.410
Welcome back to Part 9 of the blog clone project.

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.970
We've already finished quite a few templates such as the base that H Tim L which is going to be extended

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.460
to every other template has the nav bar all the SS and Javascript calls.

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.090
Then we also did the template view that simple about that HTL page where we just had two basic lines.

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.380
We also did the post list which is going to be the list of all the blog titles in the comments et.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.650
The Xs or home page.

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.770
And then once you click on those blog titles or the comments it takes that post detail page where that's

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.030
the actual blog content.

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.880
So let's now continue by filling out the rest of the templates.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.500
Now we're going to start off by doing the post form so if you're want to edit or create a new post you're

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.140
going to be taken to the post form that each time template.

13
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.580
So that's where we'll start.

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.410
And let's hop over to the editor and get started.

15
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.730
OK.

16
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.410
Here you have the post form that each team is all ready to go and have the extends and the block content

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.760
plus the end block.

18
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.560
And let's just put a header in here will say Heading 1 I'll say something like.

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.970
New Post.

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.910
And we're going to create a form here so we'll call form we'll give it a class.

21
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.020
Post dush form in case we ever want to have a class that does something like this doesn't really in

22
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.910
action because reason Gengel for that.

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.460
And then the method should be post.

24
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.350
I always like having it in capital letters just because that makes it more clear to me.

25
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.520
So I'll put that in and then if any form as we know we need a C SRF token.

26
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:38.370
So we shall say whip's C S R F underscore tokin and that is going to inject the actual form Daut as

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.130
P.

28
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.950
And remember back in the form page we had that which is attribute which is going to let me have classes

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.470
to individual elements here.

30
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.890
So in case I never really need to use post form I already have the class set up where I can actually

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.530
grab particular elements or widgets from that form.

32
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.410
And then finally we're going to need a button.

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.630
So we'll create a button there'll be type submit so we can actually submit this.

34
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.280
And let's give it a class that kind of goes with the look and feel of bootstraps so we'll say Well to

35
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.350
give it the same class in case we ever want to effect this particular button and we'll say between between

36
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.560
default.

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.220
So you probably notice I'm kind of creating classes like go along that templates.

38
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.940
Some of these I'll use some of these I will ever use.

39
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.280
But what's nice about these classes is if I ever need to actually do some CSSA editing on this particular

40
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.260
button it already has its own class call which I can add some more submit buttons.

41
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.580
And what's also nice is just reading the sample itself makes it a lot easier to understand what's going

42
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.590
on these classes.

43
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.370
Regardless if I use them or not.

44
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.660
So let me collapse this directory tree get ourselves a little more room.

45
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.390
The nameless but we actually don't need to have a name so I'll believe that.

46
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.160
And let's just have this be save.

47
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.800
And then that's the end of the form just form the token.

48
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.130
And then the button itself.

49
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460
And here is where I'm going to call script.

50
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.880
So you remember back to when we were exploring the medium Ed. page I'm going to call script here and

51
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.780
basically follow along of what they said.

52
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.570
So you can check back on that video or on that demo page.

53
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.870
But what they said to do is create this editor variable here on the page and then set it equal to a

54
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.870
new medium.

55
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:27.160
Editor object and then have it grab the edible at the will.

56
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.940
However you would say that and then save this and remember that this edible class is attached here as

57
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.490
a widget.

58
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.910
So if you go back to the actual models or forms.

59
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.970
So it's come back to models or actually it was under forms come back here.

60
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.740
There it is.

61
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.560
So here there are post forms remember were added to this and this edible class for the text itself.

62
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.780
So that central is going to help us link when we're working with the post form page here.

63
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.610
This medium editor and whip's had too many EEs there.

64
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.770
OK so save that now we should be good to go there.

65
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.510
So that's our post form page.

66
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.120
Now let's create a post draft list so maybe you haven't published this yet.

67
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.560
In which case you have the list of all your drafts.

68
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.630
So this one also going to be quite simple.

69
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.770
We're going have a for loop that's just going to go for the posts and then give some sort of creation

70
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.560
date.

71
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.280
So let's do that say four posts and posts

72
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.050
and then we need an end to four here.

73
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.350
And four and then one I'm going to do is add in a div so we'll call this the post class again.

74
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.290
May or may not use this but can help us read along here.

75
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.650
We'll have a paragraph tag give that give that the class I think we're calling them dates.

76
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:58.480
Now we'll say created and then we're going to inject here postop created underscore dates and we've

77
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:09.220
seen before I can added this template filter where we all say dates Elisha's have it be the wups dash

78
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:19.480
y ok and then we're going to do next is let's have a heading one with an anchor tag where the ref will

79
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.670
take you to that actual post detail page.

80
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:31.980
So we'll go you are all post the detail the primary key being equal to the post-up primary key.

81
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.650
And this will just be the post-Idol.

82
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.540
So the post-Idol will take you to that post e-tail page which kind of makes sense.

83
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.940
Clopton that victory tree get a little more room and then we'll have the actual post texts all eject

84
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.630
button as well.

85
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:54.150
Post that text and I'm going to use another filter called truncate characters which is just going to

86
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.250
help this as far as formatting.

87
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.830
Not necessary but kind of up to you.

88
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.220
So how truncate C H R C H R S 200.

89
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.210
OK so that's it for the draft list.

90
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.590
Basically it's going to do is go through all the posts in the post and then say when it was created

91
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.260
and if you click on the link I'll take you to the post detail page and all truncate some characters

92
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.140
so you don't see everything.

93
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.670
So we'll save that.

94
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.270
And now we have our post-draft list ready to go.

95
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.450
Let's start with this view.

96
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.570
So we have this post confirmed delete.

97
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.030
That's actually a really simple.

98
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.980
Once you click on the delete view there needs to be some sort of a success you are all that will say

99
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.930
hey do you want to delete this.

100
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.050
So we'll create a form for the basic form doesn't need an action and we don't even really need to give

101
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.190
it a class since it's essentially just a button here.

102
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.650
An organ to do is inside this form.

103
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.330
I'm going to create the C-s or token

104
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.980
token and then we'll just have something like.

105
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.130
Are you sure you want to delete questionmark.

106
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.450
And let's actually inject object here.

107
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.410
So this is something that delete view does automatically the object itself has that name or you want

108
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.170
to lead it as we saw before when we were working a class based views and then we'll have an input and

109
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:26.940
the type will be submit and let's give it a class and let's say between beats and danger which is always

110
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.180
a good call when you're going to do it the view have it be danger.

111
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.680
In our case where he won't be using his coloring eventually the loader will overwrite that coloring.

112
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.930
But for your more basic sites where you're not have we don't have such funky CSSA calls with color changing

113
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.160
a danger is a good call for the sort of the late buttons it doesn't need a name but let's give it a

114
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.740
value or something like confirm or deletes or whatever you want.

115
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.660
Save that and that's it for the post confirmed delete page.

116
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.250
So really similar to what we've done in the past with the views.

117
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.700
So that's it for that we have post form each time I'll read to go.

118
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.780
Common form is something we haven't done yet.

119
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:10.130
So that's going to be a really similar form to the draft or the post form excuse me and let's create

120
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:19.860
H-1 and this will be a new comments and then all we're gonna do is say form and we can give it a class

121
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.600
post form just so I can refer to it later.

122
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.550
It doesn't need any sort of action call.

123
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.550
And then all we're gonna do here is give it a C SRF token

124
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:39.420
and then say form as the.

125
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.260
Give it a button and this button will say it's a submit typed button doesn't need the name.

126
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:53.770
Let's give it a class we'll give it the same class that we did earlier say between PTEN defaults and

127
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.140
doesn't need a name so we'll take that out.

128
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.360
But we will give it some text here that says something like post comments and that can be the end of

129
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.780
the form.

130
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.870
And since I want the form or the comment form itself to have the same capabilities of the medium editor

131
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.610
I'll add in that script here as well.

132
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.890
So kind of up to you whether you want the comments to have such flexibility but just so we explore what's

133
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.610
possible here.

134
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.970
And the same thing.

135
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:32.010
So we say the variable editor has two new medium Ed. And then we'll adjust the class to be edible or

136
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.120
editable and semi-colons and that.

137
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.350
OK so let's open up all the templates and make sure we finished all of them we have the about page ready

138
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.000
to go.

139
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.530
We have a base that age you know rates ago comment forms ready post confirm deletes ready detail page

140
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:53.110
in the post draft list ready post forums ready post list is ready and then we still have this log in

141
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.680
each.

142
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.120
That's also ready.

143
00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:00.130
Looks like we finished all our templates so let's come over here to blog that CSSA and finish just a

144
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.650
couple of those CSSA calls.

145
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.370
This is basically totally optional and this is where a lot of your personal choices will come into play

146
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.180
as far as what you actually want the blog to look like.

147
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.870
So don't worry too much about Oregon to be doing here.

148
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.000
This is just so it lines up with the actual example code from the notes.

149
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.860
So I've taken care of this tech font.

150
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.580
That's the font that goes in that nav bar will have big brand that just makes it a little larger center

151
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.850
stage just kind of centers things a little bit more.

152
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:35.810
And then we have the loader so we create kind of loops something that says Here color changer.

153
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.790
Below comment that out and add in some of my own classes.

154
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:49.310
So something we also did was this postdates which I'm going to say text align center and some of the

155
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.320
classes we made we won't be calling here so just keep that in mind and then I'm also going to create

156
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.720
a post title.

157
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:04.970
So post-Idol will give it the same font family as Rousseau one but maybe make the same font size a little

158
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.040
bigger.

159
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.740
So the actual title the post font family grew so on and then let's make the post-Idol like 3M just so

160
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.230
it's quite a bit larger.

161
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.650
And then we'll have the text align center so it's centered there.

162
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.290
So that's the post title.

163
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.310
And then for the actual post content itself.

164
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:34.200
So how about post content class and then I'm going to give that the font family of well let's say that

165
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.420
Monserrat.

166
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:46.460
And then I will add in a font size that makes it the same font size as the post detail view.

167
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.780
There we go that way when you're editing it or viewing it all isn't the same size.

168
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.550
And I believe we already did something called center stage up here so that was good.

169
00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:01.560
And something else we want to maybe have those buttons so I think we created one called DTN comment

170
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.360
button.

171
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:10.050
To add in position so we absolute's and we'll see if this actually affects and we'll bring in all the

172
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.450
weights of the right.

173
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:18.770
I have zero pixels so that's just kind of the add comment and shifting all the way to the right.

174
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.660
And we already have big brand ready to go.

175
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.050
I believe we scroll up.

176
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.680
OK big brands where did it go.

177
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.260
So we finished off the CSA.

178
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.490
And the race the rest of the templates.

179
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.020
So we should be mostly good to go it might need to do a quick review.

180
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.740
Do any bug finding but we finished basically like 99 percent of the site.

181
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:37.470
OK.

182
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.790
So coming up next we're going to kind of wrap everything up and see if everything worked.

183
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.450
Maybe de-bug a little bit.

184
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.690
I'll see it the next lecture.
