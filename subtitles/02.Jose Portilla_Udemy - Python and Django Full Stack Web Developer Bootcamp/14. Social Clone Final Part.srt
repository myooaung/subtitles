00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,030
Welcome back everyone to the final part.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,420
The social clone project.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,840
Now our Web site actually has full functionality.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,680
We can sign up new users have them log in and they can create both groups and posts and the groups have

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,920
a count of how many members they have and how many posts they have.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,870
Now we're going to go ahead and do is add in the SS and javascript files to give this Web site a cool

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,500
look.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,250
And this is where you can diverge and customize the site to your own liking.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,420
We will copy and paste from the right notes and a lot of this code just comes from a code pen that's

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,720
publicly available.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,100
But again this is really a personal preference up to you how you want to style your particular site.

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,050
Let's up over to the notes and finish up this project.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,340
All right.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,090
Here I am in the editor and the first thing you want to do is make sure that in our settings that PI

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,160
file we have the static files linked and if you scroll all the way down I believe we may have made a

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,380
small typo.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,310
So you should have static underscore you all equal to static and static files underscore.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,490
It should be d i r s.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,230
So static file directories.

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,660
And the reason for that is because you pass it in as a list.

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,560
It could have multiple static directories.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,600
And then we say oh estopped path but join based directory static.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,950
So make sure you change that and save it so that it's static files underscore Diyar.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,740
That's ok once you have that what you need to do is come over to static and inside of simple social

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,480
C Ss in javascript create a M.Z. SS file and a master javascript file.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,330
Now inside of these I've already copied and pasted the code from the notes as well as the code in this

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,710
master CSSA other see a source file.

28
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,480
In case you ever want to play around with other things you can link this as well.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,890
Mainly we're just going to be using the C S S file which essentially makes everything black and the

30
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,310
color white and then this javascript file which is sourced from this Koeppen.

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,400
So you have the link there and this is what allows you to set the stars when you click on something

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,430
on the Web site.

33
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,970
The stars will pop up.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,590
So right now the javascript master javascript file isn't linked yet so we're going to do is linked that

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,460
to our baseline team l page.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,530
That way it shows up in every single page.

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,430
So we'll come over to base that each T.M. scroll all the way down to the bottom because we want this

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,800
to load after the entire body is loaded and we're going to add in a script call here.

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,570
So script it's going to be type text javascript and then let's say the source.

40
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,860
So the source is going to be static.

41
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:35,120
So over the static directories and it's just simple social javascript slash M.Com jazz or whatever he

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,220
happens to call it.

43
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,040
So that's where we can find it.

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,670
I'm going to save that and then this whole thing.

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,790
The source should be in quotes itself.

46
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,730
There we go.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,230
And the syntax heiling can kind of hint at that.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,980
OK so that should be all we need for that particular script.

49
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,260
Let's save that change and then let's make sure we scroll up and actually loading the static files.

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,310
Ok we are loading the static files so everything should work.

51
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,820
Let's run this and finish up this project.

52
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,300
Confirm we'd have no bugs right now coming to the Web site we can see here it says Welcome to our social.

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,480
Everything's turned black and as we hover above buttons now they're kind of inversed in color and if

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,000
you click somewhere here you'll end up seeing the stars being created so you can click a whole bunch

55
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,360
and you'll see a bunch stars being created and that's basically it.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,750
Now given the way that the actual nav bar and the content is created there is kind of a buffer zone

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,180
here.

58
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,920
As far as the stars so they're bouncing off and there's essentially I can click here to close the border

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,220
so you can see it.

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,240
There is no way to go above that.

61
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,010
Now you could spend a lot more time with CSSA and Javascript and make sure all these elements that their

62
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,700
background and their canvas is linked so that the stars go everywhere.

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,010
I mean kind of up to you.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,510
That's a lot more work on the front end.

65
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,970
That's really not what jangles about.

66
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,880
So really up to you how much you want to customize this if the stars are really your thing to be in

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,160
with but that is an example of how you could spruce up your project and just make it look better.

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,030
OK that's basically all there is to this project.

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,940
Hope you had fun.

70
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,300
The main thing to really get out of this project is creating users and creating groups of users and

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,350
having them connect that way.

72
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,070
So those two kind of model ideas essentially just an expansion off the blog project.

73
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,710
All right.

74
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,540
Hope you enjoyed it.

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,560
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lectures.
