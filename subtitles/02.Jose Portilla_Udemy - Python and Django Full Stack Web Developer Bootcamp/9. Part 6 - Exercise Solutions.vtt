Hello everyone and welcome to the solutions lecture for the part 6 exercise review.

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.050
Let's get started by hopping over to the editor.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.110
Right here we are.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.070
Let's start off with Problem 1 where we were given the string Jingo and we had to do several indexing

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.860
tasks.

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.170
And if you ever want to just reference the written out solutions you can just use the part 6 exercise

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
review solutions that py file which has the solutions written down inside of it.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.110
OK.

9
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.890
So to get the Hopefully that was an easy one for you.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.700
We'll have to do is say as the string and then type 0 to get the first element to get the last element.

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.240
There's two ways of doing this.

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.180
The easier way is just to say negative 1.

13
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:52.030
So you get the very last element of any string or you can just count over 0 1 2 3 4 5 and use 5 for

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.240
DOJ.

15
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.150
And what you have to do is say start from the beginning for colon and then go up to but not including

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.310
the fourth indexed element.

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.300
Then for Jan what you have to do here is say start at 1 and then go up to but not including the fourth

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.350
index element for Geo.

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.990
What you have to do is say yes and then start for go all the way to the end of 0 then bonus using indexing

20
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.770
to reverse the string.

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.430
This one it says start at the beginning go all the way to the end and the step size is negative 1.

22
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.510
In our course we saw earlier how we could do step size of one step size into a python also supports

23
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.750
a step size of negative 1 meaning it will reverse the string when you print that out.

24
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.840
OK.

25
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.870
Problem number two we want to hear to re-assign Hello Goodbye.

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.490
This is just an indexing call to grab the nested list.

27
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.320
So the nested list inside of it is an index too.

28
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.720
And then halo itself is indexed to and then to reassign it to be.

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.970
By with just to say equals goodbye.

30
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.860
And that's the solution for problem too.

31
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.470
Moving along to problem three we had three problems are subproblems here.

32
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.510
We had to use keys and indexing to grab Hello from the following dictionaries so dictionary number one.

33
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.620
That one's pretty simple I just say simple key.

34
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.720
Whoops I can manage to grab it.

35
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.290
OK.

36
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.730
And that's all you had to do.

37
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.370
For a dictionary Number two it's a nested dictionary.

38
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.280
So we have to do is say K-1 and then on top of that once a returns that dictionary you say k to and

39
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.810
then dictionary three this one is definitely a lot harder than the rest of them.

40
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.990
Well you have to do it several layers.

41
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.640
First you need to grab the K-1 key.

42
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.310
Then you need to grab the first element in that list.

43
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.960
Note here that this is a racket.

44
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.070
So this whole thing is a list so we're grabbing the first item in that list.

45
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:08.370
And then after that we need to grab the next key dictionary and then offer that we get this list so

46
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.530
I want to grab the second item in that list the next one.

47
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.430
And then I want to grab 0 if I don't have this additional zero.

48
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.420
It will just return a list of one item.

49
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.670
If I just want the actual string that I have this extra zero here OK.

50
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.730
Let's move on to problem for where we want to use a set to find the unique values of the list below.

51
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.310
This was really easy we did pretty much this exact example during set lecture we just say set list and

52
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.430
that's all you had to do for that.

53
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.890
Then you're given two variables.

54
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.830
Age is equal to four.

55
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.990
Name is Sammy.

56
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.190
He wanted to use print formatting to print this thing out.

57
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.140
So let's show that.

58
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:57.930
I can say prints and then hello my dog's name is and then we'll have brackets here.

59
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.990
Let's make this a.

60
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.480
And they'll say and he is bracket's years old.

61
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.250
And then we want to say outside of this format and that for that format call is going to have a equal

62
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.030
to the variable age and then be equal to the variable name.

63
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.620
And I need to put in be here now you could have also done this if the variable calls.

64
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.410
So you could have not had a not had B and then just not assigned a not assigned be here but I always

65
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.700
recommend you do an assignment that way if you ever want to change order you can do that easily but

66
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.190
that's all you have to do for this particular question.

67
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.010
And then just make sure your princes are balanced here.

68
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.540
All right.

69
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.770
If you have any questions on the solutions feel free to post the Q&amp;A.

70
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.210
Hopefully this was a pretty straightforward assignment for you.

71
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.930
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
