Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on template inheritance.

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,770
Let's learn how we can use Django template inheritance to practice dry coding principles dry standing

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,040
for it.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,210
Don't repeat yourself template inheritance allows us to create a base template we can inherit from.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,450
Earlier we saw that we created a base that H team l file but left it blank in this lecture.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,700
We're going to explain what we're going to be using it for.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,530
And in the next lecture we'll actually code out through the example template inheritance saves us a

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,360
lot of repetitive work and it makes it much easier to maintain the same base look and feel across our

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,850
entire web site for example if we wanted a nav bar at the top of our page it wouldn't make sense to

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,010
have to continually have the same nav bar ASTM Elco in each individual the HTL file.

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,230
Before this lecture we used to have to have the same nav bar as HTML code over and over again if we

12
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,530
wanted to extend it to every page in our Gengel project.

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,760
Granted we haven't actually done that at all yet but we would have had to do that given what we know

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,680
so far.

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,240
So instead of doing that we can actually set it to the base h team l file and inherits it using template

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,310
inheritance this idea is also sometimes known as template extending as an extending the base the HTL

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,200
file to other aged him files.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,980
The inheritance doesn't need to just be limited to one base to each team file.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,620
You can extend multiple templates.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,710
Before you begin any Gengel project.

21
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,330
It's always a good idea to sketch up the main idea organization by hand.

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,910
This will help you realize what can be used for template inheritance and what applications you should

23
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,360
create planning out your project in this manner will really give you a good idea of what code is going

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,660
to be constantly reuse.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,140
So you can put that into your base.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,990
Each team El-Fadl.

27
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,420
OK so what are the main steps for inheritance.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,570
Actually pretty simple.

29
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,690
First you find the repetitive parts of your project.

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,420
Things like now bar or a picture or a brand that you're going to see on most of the pages.

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,000
Then you create a base template of those repetitive parts such as the nav bar.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,470
Then you set particular tags in the base template and also those tags and just the second.

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,650
Once you've done that you extend and call those tags anywhere else in those other H.T. mail files that

34
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,400
are not the base the HTML file.

35
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,620
So what does it actually look like.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,460
Well on the left hand side we have that base to him file.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,270
This is the file it's going to have things like links to your javascript your assess your bootstrap

38
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,390
a bunch of each team all things like nav bars etc. stuff that you want to inherit on to the other pages.

39
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,030
Then inside the body stuff that you don't want on every single page you have these two main tags and

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,780
that's the block tag with the name of the Block.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,340
In this case is the body block and then you have the end the block tag.

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,090
Then you can have some more footer HTML.

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,430
Outside of that and in that left hand side baste the HTML file.

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,460
Basically what this is saying is everything outside of that is going to be inherited in the other file.

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,230
So we can see here we have some other HTL file and we want to make sure that the first line is always

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:02,920
doctype h T.M. after that you can call the extends and then actually call the path to your base studies

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,220
to metafile and then after that you call block body underscore or block that matches the name of your

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,340
baseless email file and then you have your HTL that's specific to this other that each team file stuff

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,220
that wasn't in the base then each team l.

50
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,730
Then once you're done with that you call and block so you can see it's kind of the reverse or opposite

51
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,430
on the left hand side you see everything outside of that is going to be passed in when we extend that

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,780
to the right hand side and on the right hand side everything in sight close by the box is going to be

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,850
put into the base sites female or extended with the base that it's Steimle.

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,160
OK.

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,290
So let's actually walk through a basic example of this temple inheritance.

56
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,320
It's actually a really easy and smooth process and once you start using temple inheritance is actually

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,970
going to make it much easier to read HTL files across your web page because you're going to get rid

58
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,810
of all this junk repetitive code.

59
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,450
And after that we'll all go to your base sites HTML file.

60
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,870
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
