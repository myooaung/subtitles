00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.020
Hello everyone and welcome to this quick lecture of a command line crash course being able to navigate

2
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.690
your computer through the command line is a vital skill for any web developer or any general programmer.

3
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.640
Some commands are slightly different depending on if you use a Windows computer or a Mac OS or Linux

4
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.860
computer in this lecture we're going to briefly go over a few of the important commands you should know

5
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.690
and point out any OS differences that you may find yourself facing.

6
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.410
And you could always use the download in notes for reference so there is a folder in the download notes

7
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.660
called command line crash course and everything are going to be talking about is detailed and noted

8
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.330
for you in those notes.

9
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.360
And there's a separate text for Windows computers and a separate text for Mac OS and Linux users.

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.330
Mac OS or Linux users share the same set of command lines.

11
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.300
It's only Windows users that are a little different from those two.

12
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.730
Almost all Windows computer right now.

13
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.390
So I'll walk through the windows text file just to show you how it works and I'll make sure to know

14
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.150
any differences that occur.

15
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.350
If you're using a Mac Let's get started.

16
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.560
I'm going to open up my command prompt.

17
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.260
All right so here I am at my command prompt and noticed a free Windows computer.

18
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.430
Your location is usually just told to you here on the left so I can see here that I'm under a user folder.

19
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.880
If I wanted to know all the folders that were under this current directory I could use the d r command

20
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.430
for a Windows computer and that will if a hit enter show me everything that's under that current directory.

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.650
So here you can see I have a lot of documents and you also noticed that if they start a dot that means

22
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.910
they're basically hidden.

23
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.000
So if you're looking at this in your finder or your windows viewer you won't find those.

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.080
So that's the command for a Windows computer on a Mac OS or a Linux computer.

25
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.760
The command to view all your files in the current directory is LS And that stands for list.

26
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.990
So again L S is for Mac OS and Linux users.

27
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.850
And then Diyar is for Windows users.

28
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.340
Now let's talk about changing directory.

29
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.840
Imagine that I actually want to go to a specific file here.

30
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.220
Let's say I want to go to this video's file.

31
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.910
How do I do that.

32
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.410
Will these commands actually the same whether you are on any operating system like maccaroni operating

33
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.420
system like Windows cetera what you do is you type C which stands for change directory and then you

34
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.440
type in the next directory.

35
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.080
Underneath the directory you're currently are in that you want to go to.

36
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.720
So for example if I want to go to videos I just type CD videos enter and you can see that I have changed

37
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.900
the directory into CD videos.

38
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.710
If I want to go back up a directory again this is the same for both operating systems.

39
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.630
You do see the dot dot and that will take you back up one if you don't quite remember what directory

40
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.820
is you're looking for.

41
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.780
You can just start typing the directory and then use tab to autocomplete.

42
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.850
You keep hitting tab until you find the one you want.

43
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.860
So in this case I won't see the video so I can do that again and we go back with CD and that's how that

44
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.620
works.

45
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.640
OK now let's discuss clearing the screen.

46
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.490
I have a lot of stuff here right now.

47
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.430
This is a little different.

48
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.040
The penny.

49
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.290
You're on a Mac or Windows on a Windows computer.

50
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.670
It's C LS to clear the command prompt on a Mac OS or Linux.

51
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.170
It's clear.

52
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.690
So again C-Class for Windows to clear screen clear free Mac OS or Linux and you can always reference

53
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.030
the notes here if that's easier for you.

54
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.300
All right.

55
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.770
So we learned how to list all the folders in a current directory.

56
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.680
We learned how to clear the screen if you ever want to display your current directory.

57
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.990
You can just look here on the left.

58
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.220
If you're on Windows on a Mac or a Linux computer sometimes it's not so obvious what character you're

59
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.290
currently in.

60
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.980
So you can just type in PWT which stands for print working directory.

61
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.730
Again that's for Mac OS and Linux users in case you want to print out or display your current directory.

62
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.540
If I am on a Windows I can either just look to the left or also just typing CD will also print out my

63
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.300
current directory.

64
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.040
But you can see it's exactly the same as what is or it displayed for me.

65
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.530
OK so now that we learn how to display our current directory We are basically done with everything that

66
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.080
we need it's cover for the command line crash course.

67
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.700
There's also things such as make their victory if you want to make a new folder that's going to be something

68
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.140
like make directory M-K Diyar and that's the same for any operating system.

69
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.460
And then you just say wherever the new directory you want so something like New Folder.

70
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.620
But we're not going to be doing that too often throughout the course and if we ever do touch upon so

71
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.230
command lines that you haven't seen yet I'll be sure to let you know what they are and how we use them.

72
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.150
But right now the only ones you should really be aware of is how to change directory.

73
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.290
The most useful is against CD type in the directory name you're looking for.

74
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.980
For example videos you can use tab to help autocomplete this.

75
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.190
And if you ever want to go back should see the dot dot.

76
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.010
That's really the main one that I wanted to know.

77
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.460
Changing the directory ness the same regardless of your operating system.

78
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.200
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
