1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,690
Welcome back everybody to part for the blog Klon project.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,670
So now it's time to actually get to the meat of the project which is creating views and templates and

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,720
connecting them to your else.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,960
We'll start off with the class based views handling the actual blog posts and the basic structure that

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,000
we're going to follow here is we'll try to create a view see how to set it up and then we'll create

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,900
the template that matches with that view.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,860
A lot of class based views have some sort of default template name so we'll create that template we

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,170
will actually fill out those H.A. files.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,100
We'll do that in a future lecture.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,410
OK.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,140
Let's get started.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,930
Hop over to the editor.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,480
OK so the first step here is to actually go to views that pie underneath our blog folder and other need

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,750
templates I also have a blog folder here which is where I will be adding those ASTM l files.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,760
So let's start off by actually creating the baseline each team file that will be inheriting or extending

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,680
from.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,750
So I will create a new file under blog and call it base h TNL.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,040
So there it is.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,820
And I'll just type in H-2 him here later on we'll work a lot more with his team files.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,050
But coming back to views that PI Let's start off with that about page since that's one of the simplest

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,120
ones we have to do.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:26,940
So I will say from jingo views the generic import and I'm going to import with princes since I'm going

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,980
to do multiple imports.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,870
I can use princes have them across multiple lines.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,970
And the first one that I want is this template you so will say.

26
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:46,910
Class and we'll call this the about you and this will be a template view and all we do here is say the

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,710
template underscore a name.

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,270
And we're going to connect that to about the H Tim L and that's really all we have to do.

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,040
And then we're going to come here to blog create a new file call it about each T.M. and then we can

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:10,660
say well we're here or something like extends and then in quotes something like blog slash based Timo

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,100
and then we can add a lot more content in here like the body block etc. But once we have that the other

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,220
thing I want to do is add this to our list of your else.

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:27,600
So coming back to your stop pie notice I'm under the blog you're up high which is currently empty.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,550
So let's set up a way to connect our sites Yarl's that pie to our actual blog you are that pie.

35
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,030
So I'll come first to the Eurostar pie of our entire site.

36
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,100
So this one already has a configuration that will scroll all the way down.

37
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:51,080
And then when I'm going to do here is say also import include since I'll be using that and then I need

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,130
to import some views so I will say actually we'll skip that for now.

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,670
I we'll say your el and basically I'm just going to say anything.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:14,470
That's not the admin page go to blogs thought else and we can pass this as a string and then that's

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:21,390
going to do is going to look for the blocks application and then find that Urals that PI file.

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,220
So we'll save that for now.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,530
And that means we can come back to this Yarl's that PI file and start editing it.

44
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,470
We're not quite done with the project's URLs that PI file but for now we'll just leave it like that.

45
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,770
We have to add in all that registration stuff but we'll talk about that once we actually get to that

46
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,170
for the PI file of the blog application.

47
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:50,150
I'm going say from Jingo the Siona for configuration thought you Elle's import Yoro.

48
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,330
And then I'll say from blog import views.

49
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,010
And as always you could have also said from datt import views and then we're going to have a your all

50
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,770
patterns list and this will eventually grow to be a super large list and we just have this all basically

51
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,730
feeding into the single application.

52
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:16,430
But let's start off by saying your L and we'll have the about page B slash about.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:24,130
So let's do this with regular expressions and we'll say about slash dollar sign.

54
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,690
And this is going to be views.

55
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,820
And then the about you we just created.

56
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:37,580
Remember we have to say as of you know we'll give it the name about Khama save.

57
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,880
All right.

58
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,880
So our first view is basically done now.

59
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,800
So let's come back to use that pie and start the next one.

60
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,860
And basically we're going to be doing over and over again there's going to be a ton of your all's views.

61
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,770
And as I mentioned that's kind of the meat of the entire project.

62
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:59,530
So the actual home page is going to be the list of all the posts so I'll say class a post list view.

63
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,790
And that's going to inherit from a list view so let's have that in on our import statement comma list

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,670
view and then I'm going to start a new line here.

65
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:19,560
Later on we'll add some more imports so I'll have a list of you that I'm inheriting from and then I

66
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
need to connect that to a model.

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,480
So I'm going to connect this to the post model but in order to do that I should actually import it.

68
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,920
So coming back up here we'll say from blog models import and let's import both models are created.

69
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,770
We created a post model and a comment model and then the other thing I want to do here is actually define

70
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,850
how I want to grab this list.

71
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,610
So when we get a little more room here Heidi that terminal and basically what I can do is I can create

72
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,600
a method called Get underscore query set self.

73
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,270
And this allows me to use jingoes or M when dealing with just generic views.

74
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,000
That way I can add a little more of a custom touch to it.

75
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,880
So we kind of do this a lot when we were in a function based views but we can actually do this as well

76
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,260
with class based views.

77
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,550
By the finding particular get methods and we'll get a lot more practice with this in future projects.

78
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:23,350
But basically what I say is the actual queries I want is going to be post all the objects and I want

79
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:34,870
to filter them by the published underscore dates and then I'm also going to add an underscore underscore

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,830
T and I will set that equal to time zone.

81
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:50,070
Now and then I'm going to also say dots order by and let me collapse this directory tree to get some

82
00:06:50,070 --> 00:07:00,900
more room here and then I'm going to say as a string dash published underscore dates.

83
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,350
And that's my whole query set.

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,880
All right so what does this all actually mean.

85
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:13,940
Well with the get queries set I'm basically almost doing a query like a sequel query on my model.

86
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,620
So this is essentially kind of pie funnies version of writing a sequel query.

87
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:28,250
So what I'm saying is grab the post model all the objects there and filter out based on these conditions.

88
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,820
So then we have grabbed the published they and then with the field queries you can do this really interesting

89
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,280
thing where you say underscore underscore and then the actual field.

90
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,260
So in this case it's going to be less than or equal to.

91
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,070
And I'm going to hop over to documentation link a little bit to kind of explain this part a little more

92
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,590
because out of all this is probably the strangest thing.

93
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,850
Underscore underscore LTE which we've never seen before.

94
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:01,540
We haven't really died this deep into the OR AM of jingo but basically this is asking is OK grabbed

95
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,930
the published dates that are Lessner equal to the current time and then order them by published day.

96
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,720
Except with this dash we can clarify whether we want ascending or descending because if we were not

97
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,890
to order them by Dasch published they would be happening is we would see the oldest blog post first.

98
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,660
So here with this dash I can order them in kind of a descending order.

99
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,960
So the most recent blog post comes up front or at the top of this list view.

100
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,270
So this is the get query set method and essentially allows you to use this or sort of a particular query

101
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,970
on a list so you can only get items that you want in the list with some sort of filter and then you

102
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,220
can also order them.

103
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,810
So let me hop over to the documentation briefly to explain a little more about this kind of curious

104
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,350
line underscore underscore LTE.

105
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,450
All right so here I am at the documentation now with the documentation for 1.1 0 although if that by

106
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,860
the time you're looking at this it's one point eleven This should be basically the same.

107
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:10,360
And I'm on their slash topic slash slash queries and I can just do control Ephor command and look up.

108
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:17,030
Underscore underscore LTE and you'll find a simple example but this all falls under field lookups where

109
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,750
it's essentially how you can specify some sort of sequel query using the query set methods.

110
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,610
And there's three main Chrisette set methods filter exclude and get and the basic lookups look like

111
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,110
this.

112
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,760
The actual field you want the fields of our model member those are the attributes and then underscore

113
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,380
underscore and then the lookup type equal to some sort of value.

114
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,000
And again that's a double underscore.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,800
So for example in this kind of plays along with what we've done is we say entry so whatever that model

116
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,480
was the object so grabble as objects and then filter them based on some condition.

117
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,660
In this case they want where the publication date is less than or equal to this particular value.

118
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,360
So roughly translates into the following sequel.

119
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,370
If you're not familiar sequel don't worry about this too much.

120
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,780
But if you are this is probably really helpful to you.

121
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,770
So it says select everything from a blog entry or whatever entry we have here where the publication

122
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,800
date is less than equal to this particular date.

123
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,370
So almost exactly the same example that we're working with here.

124
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,190
Now if you're curious more about how this is actually possible because this is definitely some more

125
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,870
advanced Python as far as how the creators of Django kind of built this and with this underscore underscore

126
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,030
they have a link here to keyword arguments.

127
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,550
They can read more into but but you're probably more interested in is how to actually figure out what's

128
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,500
possible here in this double underscore how you actually keep scrolling down.

129
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,400
And then there's various examples that are available to you so you can say underscore underscore exact

130
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,030
which translates into just an equal call and keep scrolling down you can say I exact which is going

131
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,170
to be case insensitive matching you can say contains.

132
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,670
And this essentially just he keeps rolling down a bunch of stuff that has to do with translating sequel

133
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,670
code into Python.

134
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,920
But the weird confusion about it is this more advanced Python mechanism where you have these double

135
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,090
underscores separating the actual field versus the type of comparison you're doing.

136
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,070
Now we're not going to be using these too often throughout this particular project but I do want you

137
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,210
to be aware of them and later on in a few trial section.

138
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,650
We'll talk more about the OR em that Shingo has but I just want you to be aware.

139
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,340
Again you can always check the documentation page here if you want more in-depth information on this

140
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,770
but that's a little background to where we got all those commands from.

141
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,670
OK.

142
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,340
So that's the post list view.

143
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,250
Let's minimize this and go add this view to actual Uriel's that PI file.

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,570
So I'm going to come over to your Allsopp high of my blog.

145
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,670
So there it is.

146
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,290
And let's actually listen.

147
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,290
So I'll say Khama call your all again.

148
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,470
And then what I'm going to do here is since this is actually going to be the home page let's delete

149
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,370
this and let's make this the top one.

150
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,870
So usually you always see the homepages First you are a pattern.

151
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,500
So let's do that here.

152
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:14,200
So I'll say our care and then dollar sign and this is going to accept the use dot post list view to

153
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:22,040
underscore view and then I'm going to set the name equal to post underscore list which is kind of the

154
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,900
default name it expects here and that's it.

155
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,730
So again I'm setting the home page to all my current blog posts that are published and that's it for

156
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,230
that particular post list view.

157
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,230
So let's continue moving along.

158
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,690
And you can always reference the code to make sure it matches exactly.

159
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,300
So if you ever get stuck on something.

160
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,830
Make sure you're checking out the code notes next year we're going to make is another class based view

161
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,890
So let's say you have those lists of posts at click on one.

162
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,800
It takes me to an actual blog post.

163
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,000
That means it's a detailed view.

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,770
So this one's a lot simpler.

165
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,960
All I have to do is say post detail view and then what I'm going to do is appear.

166
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,610
Let's import detail.

167
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,840
Say that and here I'm going to say detail view and underneath the detail view.

168
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,820
All I have to do is say model is equal to post and that's it.

169
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,020
That's a detail view as we've seen before.

170
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,680
Let's go at it in I'll come over to my Urals up-I blog.

171
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,330
And then a lot of this is taken care of for me.

172
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:40,020
So we'll say your el and then here we're going to do is for a post the tilt view I'll say that's going

173
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,480
to be under post and then I'm going to add some regular expressions here which is going to basically

174
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,110
be taking the primary key and we've seen this a little bit before but let's go ahead and show it again.

175
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,870
It's going to be question mark p..

176
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:04,790
And then it's going to accept piquing like this backslash the plus and then outside of this dollar sign.

177
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,500
And again I would never really expect anyone to know this off the top of my head and lost it working

178
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,290
a lot with Django.

179
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,410
This is more the kind of thing that you reference other examples with documentation for.

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
But we've already seen how do a detail.

181
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,420
So we've seen this or something very similar to this before but luckily a lot of this heavy lifting

182
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:27,200
for us in our lives that say is post detailed view and call as View.

183
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,040
And this will automatically take care of matching the primary key to whatever you clicked on.

184
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:40,860
And then let's give this a name and we'll set the name equal to just post underscore detail.

185
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,590
OK so that's a detail view of that post.

186
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,560
Let's save that and we'll hop right back over to use that pi and move onto the next class based view.

187
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,080
We're going to kind of get some more space here.

188
00:14:52,540 --> 00:15:00,130
And next thing I want to do is sort of create view so I'll say class and we'll say create post view

189
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,860
and then we want to inherit from create view.

190
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,970
But first thing you need to do is actually import it.

191
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:13,390
So we'll come back up here and then we'll say create a view save that come down.

192
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,400
And then what I want to do is connect my model to be able to post.

193
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,860
And that's what we've seen before.

194
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,320
But there's a couple of more things so we want to do here.

195
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:31,450
And the main thing we want to do is I don't want anyone to be able to access this create post view earlier

196
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,670
when we were talking about authentication authorization.

197
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,630
We discussed using decorator's So remember we had that at symbol we have something like lock in required

198
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,630
but that only really works for function based views.

199
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:49,170
And now we want to know how do we actually work with that sort of log in required with a class based

200
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,830
view.

201
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,420
And that's where the term mixdowns come in.

202
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,430
So you haven't seen any real Moxon's but they're really easy to use just like those decorators were

203
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,320
easy to use.

204
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,400
You just scroll at the top here and you're going to import them.

205
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:11,450
So I won't say from jingo contrib you th mixdowns.

206
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm going to import.

207
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:23,260
And then the one we want is called loggin required Mixon and you can basically think of this akin to

208
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,590
the decorator so I'll show you the example of a decorator one where we're we said from Django da contrib

209
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,700
a th da decorator's import loggin underscore required.

210
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,160
So essentially back when you're dealing with function based views to actually get that sort of automated

211
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,210
logging required functionality you had to use these decorators.

212
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,850
But luckily a class space to use the analogy to that is using these mixdowns and these are essentially

213
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,750
classes that we mix in to the classes we're inheriting with.

214
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,600
So not only do we want to create value but we're going to mixin that log in required.

215
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,260
That's kind of where they get their name from.

216
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,860
So I'll say log in required Mixon Khama.

217
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,280
So now I'm going to inherit methods from both of these classes.

218
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,440
So not just create new but also logging required mixin in with the mixdowns they take in a couple of

219
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,140
more attributes that are necessary.

220
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,900
So one attribute we want to do is set up the log in you are all some cases persons not logged in.

221
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,120
Where should they go.

222
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,860
And later on we'll say they should go to slash logon.

223
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:37,000
Almost like when you're setting up the static files and then we also want to do is have some sort of

224
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,960
redirect field so that attribute is called redirects underscore field underscore name and I want to

225
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:57,100
set that equal to blog slash post underscore detail dot h HVM L and what we're going to do is going

226
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,670
to say.

227
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,040
All right.

228
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:08,590
So redirect them to the detailed view and then we'll say form class as equal to post form.

229
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,870
But that means we actually need to import that.

230
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:16,070
So I'm going to scroll back up here and we imported the models already let's actually import the forms

231
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:27,740
themselves say from blog that forms in poor host form and import the comment form.

232
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,020
So what does this all doing.

233
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,920
Well I have the Create post view that we've seen before.

234
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,320
We've seen it just to create view where you kind of have these models or these forms connected.

235
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,740
But now I'm also kind of mixing in the slogging required just like I did with decorator's But this is

236
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,070
kind of the class based view version also very easy to use.

237
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,890
You just end up having these two fields where you want to read redirect or where the lock in your l

238
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,440
should be.

239
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,070
So we'll put those all in here and we will save that and we're going to come back to you or else that

240
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,360
pi file and then match set up to some sort of your alcohol.

241
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:12,040
So I will say your L and we'll say this says post and you can say post create but you're not limited

242
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,800
to just saying create you can call this whatever you want.

243
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,060
So oftentimes you're not going to want the your all to just always say create.

244
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,870
Maybe you want your own specific thing especially of larger sites for users.

245
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,450
In this case let's call this post new which kind of also makes sense.

246
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:34,790
So say our posts slashed new and then over here what I'm going to do is say views die and I'm going

247
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:46,350
to create a post that you underscore as you and then I will say name is equal to post underscore.

248
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,800
You and I'm going to say that.

249
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,050
So this is now my create post view.

250
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,270
So let's continue on.

251
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:02,250
I've been able to check out the details of a post create a post to my home page and then at my About

252
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,360
page tech checking off a lot of these boxes on generic views.

253
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,560
Let's continue on.

254
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,800
A lot of times I'll probably want to update a post.

255
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,460
Maybe I made a mistake so I don't want to just be able to create them.

256
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,820
I want to update them which means coming back up here.

257
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,760
Member This is all from those crud lectures.

258
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,680
Going Say up the view.

259
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:29,500
Scroll back down and then we'll create a new class and we'll call this post up.

260
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,660
You and we'll have this also be loggin required makes sense if I need to actually update something I

261
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,940
should be logged in.

262
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,100
And then we'll call up that view and then this is going to the same log in your Arel and our field name

263
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,230
as the creation of it.

264
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:52,010
In fact it's actually going to have everything the same so we can just copy and paste this and whips

265
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,770
out my colon and there it is.

266
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,030
All right.

267
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,990
So all these attributes are the same for update and creation which makes a lot of sense.

268
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,460
Basically the only thing you're saying is OK now you're updating it instead of creating a brand new

269
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:04,910
one.

270
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,180
Which kind of has to do with whether or not you're creating new primary key or linking to an old one.

271
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,360
So same thing has always come back to your not pie hopefully or begin it's kind of fill out the pattern

272
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,090
of what we're doing here and we'll start some regular expressions.

273
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,690
So I'll say this is post and actually this should be you should have carrots on them.

274
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,740
So I apologize that I forgot about that.

275
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,670
But there we go.

276
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:37,480
These were off carrots now and then what we're gonna say is for the post up they will say post slash

277
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,870
and then I'm going to call the same sort of primary key.

278
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,550
To make sure it matches the primary key essentially just making sure you link to the correct one.

279
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:56,250
And then let's say something like slash at and then we'll have a dollar sign here so I'm going say something

280
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:04,650
like oh post number one at that post and then we'll say Khama views thoughts and then I should have

281
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,490
a post up that you.

282
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,050
There it is as always in your column as View.

283
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,480
And then we'll give it some sort of name and let's call this name post underscore at it you can have

284
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,290
us call the post up.

285
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,860
If you just remember that name and match it or I call post at it.

286
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,130
OK.

287
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,780
Almost none of the post use.

288
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,330
Coming back to views that pi I have right now my creating updating detailed view listing view about

289
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,090
you.

290
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,270
This is all just for the blog posts.

291
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,240
And then what I also want is to take care of the drafts.

292
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,550
So remember I publish posts but before they're published they're going to be drafts.

293
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:54,500
So let's actually create a view that lists all my unpublished drafts which means I'm going to create

294
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,540
a class and actually before we do that let's kind of sneak in a simpler one.

295
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,320
What if I want to delete a post.

296
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,640
I'll need a post delete you and I will take care of that draft in just a second.

297
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,740
But this should also be log in required and this is going to inherit from the view.

298
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,000
We have an important so let's do that as well.

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,730
So update delete.

300
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:26,120
And if this is confusing you definitely check out the crud lecture inside of the advanced class lecture

301
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,790
or section I should say.

302
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,200
OK so here's class Postol view.

303
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,880
Logging required mixin.

304
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,640
And then I'm going to call you this is a really simple one.

305
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,670
We just connect it to the model that we're going to be the leading from and then we need some sort of

306
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,170
success.

307
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,680
You are all so hopefully remember this as well.

308
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,160
So what happens when you actually delete it.

309
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,540
Where should it go.

310
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,910
And remember that when you're deleting have you you don't want the success you are l to actually activate

311
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,370
until you delete it.

312
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,410
Otherwise what kind of be jumping always to another Web site or another page on your website.

313
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,230
I should say in order to do this we need to use the reverse lazy.

314
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:14,410
So again scrolling all the way back up here will say from jingo your Elle's import reverse underscore

315
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,670
lazy.

316
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:21,070
That way it waits until you've actually deleted it to give you back the success you are ill that you're

317
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,290
going to be going to.

318
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:29,770
So we'll have it go back to the home page which is going to call reverse lazy and then we'll pass and

319
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,860
the post underscore lists and I will say that.

320
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,770
OK so let's delete view.

321
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,710
And that basically takes care of our crud.

322
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:45,110
This sort of creates updating the actual retrieval process well that's just displaying it.

323
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,570
So that's kind of inherent to all these slices and then deleting.

324
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,120
So these are my credit views right here these three.

325
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,280
And then I also have the detail list and about or a template I should say.

326
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,810
OK.

327
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,870
So come back to your old pie and her blog and I know there's a lot of code hopefully isn't seem super

328
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,350
overwhelming if you saw this all at once.

329
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,560
It would seem kind of crazy but I believe the way we're kind of structuring it out here.

330
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,900
It shouldn't be so bad.

331
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,330
And we just create the delete view.

332
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,020
Let's set that up.

333
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,670
So we'll say post underscore and are going to copy and paste this again.

334
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,430
And then we will say slash and let's call it.

335
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:37,770
I don't I'll call it remove dollar sign and then we'll call you use dots and this should be call post

336
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,440
delete you there it is.

337
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,860
And then we call it.

338
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,060
View and we'll give it a name and we'll call this name so kind of matches up with the other one will

339
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,700
say post remove comma.

340
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,780
OK.

341
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,850
Now you could always break this up into multiple lines.

342
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,590
So a lot of people when at work of these you or else they kind of style them like this just so it's

343
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,570
more readable.

344
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,290
I'm going to follow along with the actual notes that I have for you guys where everything's on a single

345
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:07,890
line.

346
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:13,350
But keep in mind this isn't exactly the best pep 8 styling since it's going beyond the number of character

347
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,880
limits here kind of line.

348
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,210
It's a very faint line.

349
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,090
But again I think it's a little easier to read if you just kind of scroll back and forth versus having

350
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,830
everything on multiple lines.

351
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,140
OK.

352
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,830
Just a little side note coming back to you is that pie.

353
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:32,300
We have one last class based of you will come over to use that pie and finish it.

354
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,520
And that is that draft list I was mentioning.

355
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:43,980
So let's create it will say draft's list of you and this is just another list view.

356
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,920
So again I'm going to call a loggin required and this will look a lot like the post list view except

357
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,220
it's going to have a query set specifying that I want to make sure the published day isn't there so

358
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,140
will specify a log in the oral is equal to log in

359
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,950
and then get some more lines and here I also want the redirect.

360
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:22,420
So let's actually say the redirect field name is going to be equal to blogs slash posts underscore list

361
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,430
HVM El and then connect to a model.

362
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,240
The model is just going to be the post.

363
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,670
And this looks basically exactly like the post list view.

364
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:41,010
So if we jump back up to the post list view Remember I said for the post view get me stuff that's actually

365
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:46,000
been published less than or equal to the times are now to kind of make sense you know and stuff.

366
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,870
So you should publish just in case you get some more air that way.

367
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,780
And then we also have the ordering of it in this case.

368
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,560
If I scroll down for the drafts I want to also get a query set.

369
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,660
But I want to make sure that there actually isn't a publication date on it.

370
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:16,530
So I'll say the get queries sent pasand self and I will return post the objects that filter and I will

371
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:23,710
grab that published dates underscore underscore and the method I'm going to use here is called is null

372
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,000
and I'll set that equal to true.

373
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,480
So what does that actually say.

374
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,600
Well if this is a list of my drafts that I want to make sure that it doesn't actually have a publication

375
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,350
date meaning I want is not true.

376
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:46,870
And then we're going to do is offer that I will call order by and I'll order these by the created the.

377
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,130
You could also say Dasch created they kind of up to you the pinning on how you think they should best

378
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,210
be ordered.

379
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:58,880
So we'll save that and then we make sure that my principles are balanced that pier times are now ordered

380
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:06,660
by and it's I look at this post to you I should actually have in other parentheses here.

381
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,190
OK.

382
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,760
So that makes more sense.

383
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,550
So I was getting some weird errors because there was some unbalanced Princie here.

384
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,320
Let me scroll that way over here and delete that one.

385
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,650
OK.

386
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:23,410
So just a quick note I forgot to add this predeceased because it should be an entire filter command

387
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,890
and then off of that should be entire order by command.

388
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,550
So I was actually calling off the now instead of off the entire filter call.

389
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,650
It's kind of more clear if we scroll down here we have this entire filter command and then we have this

390
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,100
entire order by command.

391
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,920
And last but not least we need to still add the draft list view.

392
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,950
You are also again turning back to the API file.

393
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,180
And let's hit it up.

394
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,000
So let me make sure I have a comma here and I will say your L and hopefully on your screen this is a

395
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,260
little more clear.

396
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:01,890
Right now I'm zoomed in for you guys but on my screen I'm kind of program about myself and a zoomed

397
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,540
in.

398
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,860
So what I'm going to say is post and this is going to be for that draft list.

399
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:16,570
So let's say for instance we want actually just make the stress keep it simple so traps are signed.

400
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:23,050
So if we're ever go to drafts and I'm like then I'll be able to see all my dress and it's going to be

401
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:31,610
views on the draft list of you since it's a class based for and to say it's view and let's give this

402
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,180
a name.

403
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:42,240
It's a really obvious name so don't forget it will say post draft list comma folks.

404
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:47,200
So that is all the class based views were going to be working with in our project.

405
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,530
Now I know I said that's all.

406
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,240
But there's definitely quite a bit of them.

407
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,380
Definitely take the time to review what we've done here.

408
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,730
There is a lot of code.

409
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:02,180
I mean basically we just wrote what about 46 lines plus all these specific or else about 50 lines of

410
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,340
code stuff.

411
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,230
We take the time review what we just did check with the notes make sure things matching exactly in case

412
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,640
you run into any errors.

413
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,210
I know we haven't actually been running the site but that's just to make sure you completely understand

414
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,610
each of these views.

415
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,100
Hopefully this all made basic sense.

416
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,570
The main things that were near that we introduced was the ability to have this get queery set inside

417
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,950
of these template views.

418
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,270
And the other thing we introduced is if you scroll down this sort of logging required Mixon which is

419
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,900
just analogous to those decorators that we've worked with before.

420
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:40,120
OK I know these are really long lectures so definitely take some time walk around relax.

421
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,090
You definitely earned it.

422
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,380
After listening to all of this.

423
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,300
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
