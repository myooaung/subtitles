1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,830
Welcome everyone to part 12 of the social clone project.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,750
Now go ahead and try running our application our Web site and see if there's any debugging that we need

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,200
to do.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,920
I'm sure we've made typos along the way.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,920
So let's see how we can actually fix those.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,090
We also need to make sure we do our migrations and double check our settings that PI file so that the

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,790
applications that we just created groups and post are actually inside that setting that profile.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,560
Let's get started ok here and back at the editor and I want to open up our settings that py files under

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,850
simple social project.

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,070
Open up settings that pi and then I'm going to scroll down to the installed apps and I want to make

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:47,040
sure that we add in the groups app that we've made as well as the Post's app.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,970
So we will save that and I also want to make sure that we do the migrations so I'm going to clear my

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:59,200
console or CLX if you're on Windows and then say Python managed up high so make sure and then the right

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,950
one.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:07,200
See the two simple social Python managed at PI and then I'm going to type migrate it should complain

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,330
and we'll run that.

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:09,940
OK great.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,700
So it complains.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:19,800
So we're going to do say Python managed up-I make migrations and we'll start off with groups hit enter

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,790
and then want to do Python manage that PI make migrations and then we'll do posts enter and then files

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,000
say Python managed up PI migrate and then it's ready to go.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,400
So now it's actually try running this and see if we need to debug anything.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,980
I'll say Python managed up high run server.

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,370
Ok it looks like it's running.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,020
Let's hop over to our browser.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,990
OK my browser everything's looking like it's functioning.

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,640
So let's actually log in and see if we can create a new group and then create a new post in it.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,060
I will log in.

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,590
Actually let's sign up just to make sure everything's working.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,180
So I will sign up as Jose my e-mail address will just be Jose at gmail dot com.

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,900
That's not my real email address so don't bother.

32
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,690
Whoever that Jose is will say yes password just password and then sign up.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:17,290
Ok now I'm going to log in username Jose password is test password log in and it says now we're logged

34
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:17,500
in.

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,180
Great.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,540
So I have this create group.

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,900
So let's try creating a group on that.

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,220
Actually we haven't linked that yet so we still need to on our actual navigation bar.

39
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,480
Make sure that's working.

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,610
So that's something we can add in.

41
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,850
Let's go ahead and hop over to the editor and fix that.

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,900
So back in the editor I will open up the base h team I'll file that's the one that actually has a navigation

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,510
bar let me collapse my directory tree so based on age HTML where the navigation bar is remember I have

44
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,600
all these kind of missing links so let's add those in.

45
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:56,720
First the your URL for a post is just going to be your goal posts create and then for groups.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,490
It's going to be it's the template tag here.

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:08,090
Dorel groups all and then four create groups.

48
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,160
It's going to be

49
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,060
groups create and then let's also fix this one so.

50
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:27,220
Else we will say groups and that will be your el groups all.

51
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,680
So the list of all the groups.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,940
OK save that.

53
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,250
And now let's hop back over here and refresh this page.

54
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,980
And I have a syntax error so it says groups create expected.

55
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,260
Elif Elser and.

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,650
Did you forget to register or load this tag.

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,780
So let's make sure it was actually groups create for the groups creation page and a hop back over and

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,890
make sure I fix that.

59
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,380
So here am seeing groups create and looks like it for its Taipan.

60
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,810
So not going to save that.

61
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,030
It'll refresh again.

62
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,360
OK.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,270
So it looks like post is not a registered namespace.

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,270
So what does that actually mean.

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,590
Well it says error during template rendering based on each T.M. line 29.

66
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,030
So if I come over here it says posts create it's not valid.

67
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,100
Let's make sure that you're not py file.

68
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,600
I've actually defined posts as the app name.

69
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,210
So hop back over here.

70
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,470
Open up my directory Chewey under posts.

71
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,070
I'll open up your All-Starr pie looks like my app name is registered.

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,810
So now let's make sure we have create registered.

73
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,650
It looks like that's working as well.

74
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,470
Which means it may be an issue with the Urals that py file in the project level.

75
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,780
So let's go over to your oles that pie at a project level.

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,690
And if I scroll down here it looks like I still have the groups and post links so that's definitely

77
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,790
something I need to add in.

78
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,760
It's a good thing where the buggy now and hopefully this is kind of obvious to you as you kind of went

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,670
along here.

80
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,960
So I'll do Khama add in your l and now it's time to register post-soul say using regular expression

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,160
curat posts and essentially just linking to the actual post-soul say include.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,270
And I'm going to include posts.

83
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,120
Or else.

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,850
And then let's give it a name space which is essentially what it was complaining about.

85
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,420
So this was the era that we were getting.

86
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,160
It wasn't complaining about the other posts.

87
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,920
And let's add one more here for the groups.

88
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:27,940
So we'll say Kurt groups forward slash then I'm going to include groups stop your else and then give

89
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,810
a name space equal to groups and I will save that.

90
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,610
OK.

91
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,470
Perfect.

92
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,810
Now try again you can see auto restarted for us.

93
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,490
We'll come back over here refreshed the page says Now I'm logged in.

94
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,550
It's looking good.

95
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,770
Let's get on groups and it says welcome back at Jose that's looking good.

96
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,170
Groups Welcome to the group's page.

97
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,230
And then of that I'm noxious plus sign but it says create new group.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,030
Obviously we can add more CSSA styling to make that look better.

99
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,310
Let's try getting create group here make sure that works so that works as well.

100
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,550
I'm going to go back to space and make sure this button works as well and it looks like they're taking

101
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,290
us to the same groups new.

102
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,850
So that's looking good.

103
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,490
I will say first group and description will be my first group.

104
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,780
Then hit create.

105
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,690
OK.

106
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,230
Looks like we have an issue here says groups name.

107
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,380
Reverse is not defined.

108
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,400
So hopefully by now you kind of realize I probably forgot to import reverse somewhere so somewhere along

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,430
the line I need a reverse call.

110
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,220
I probably called it but didn't actually import it because it says name reverse is not defined.

111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,320
So let's go back and make sure in our group's file or we're actually having that create group view.

112
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,770
We imported reverse.

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,160
So welcome back.

114
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,940
So coming back to my actual editor I can now see if I expand my command line here that I get this name.

115
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,400
Err name reverse not defined in going up.

116
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,120
It actually tells me where it's coming from it's coming from simple social groups models not by line

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,050
30 and get absolute L.

118
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,580
So that's probably where the issue is.

119
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,170
So let's go ahead and find that models that py file.

120
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,730
It's not in views so we're willing to scroll down a little bit.

121
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,990
Come over to models PI and then over here we're actually going to see if we can fix that mistake.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,910
So over in line 30 it says if you scroll down.

123
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,120
Return reverse.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,820
So it looks like we just forgot to import reverse.

125
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:27,190
So now we'll come back up here and we'll save from jingo core your resolvers in poor reverse.

126
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,490
OK so we will now save that and it looks like it's running again.

127
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,930
Come back up here.

128
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,200
Go back and then refresh this page.

129
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:44,860
And let's try a second group and we'll labeled scription of second try create.

130
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,530
All right so now back at the page after refreshing it looks like a group was created.

131
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,360
Now the fonts actually really large here.

132
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,140
That's because I'm zoomed in 200 percent so keep that in mind.

133
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,690
A lot of the things that we do have bootstrap may look a little strange here just because I'm zoomed

134
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,940
in so much to make sure you guys can see clearly but we have the second group member count is zero.

135
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,660
Let's try to join this group and see if it works.

136
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,190
I joined and now the member count is 1 and let's leave.

137
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,460
See if that works and looks like we have a problem with leave so it says name models is not defined.

138
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,130
So over here we're saying models not group member the object filter and that's in the views that py

139
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,690
file of our groups.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,180
So looks like we forgot to import models or do something for actual views that py file inside a group

141
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,730
slut's head over and mixture.

142
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,650
We actually imported the group models will come back over here and this is the views that py file and

143
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,840
what I need to do on is from the import models.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,770
Save that now let's head back and refresh this page.

145
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,870
And looks like we're still getting leave.

146
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,300
Group has KQ 0 6.

147
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,750
Definitely misspelled something here that should have been a W.

148
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,140
So again we'll come back over here and let's see if we can search for that K-Q.

149
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,730
There you go.

150
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,770
That should be KW args.

151
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,610
Save that and make sure that there's double asterisks here as well and will come back.

152
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,380
Refresh the page and number count 0 so try joining again and illustrate leaving again.

153
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,130
It looks like it's working perfect.

154
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,850
Now there's no post in this group.

155
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:20,740
So try posting something I'll click on post and say this is my first test post exclamation point in

156
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,570
under group.

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,680
Just to assign this to second group post.

158
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,560
All right now we get this error that says user posts object has no attribute post and the fact that

159
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
it's saying has no attribute.

160
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,250
You remember you call attributes with a dot or period meaning.

161
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,360
Probably somewhere along the line I'm calling Post Office something where I really shouldn't be doing

162
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,840
that.

163
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,990
And it says right here it's under simple social post views that pie in line 28.

164
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,920
So let's head back to views that pi and other posts views that pi.

165
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,990
Here it is.

166
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,050
I'm going to take a look at this on line 28.

167
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,820
I can see here I'm saying try self-taught post thought user equals a user object.

168
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,220
Really what it should have been doing is assigning this.

169
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,630
So here I said self-taught post underscore user and that's actually what I meant to do.

170
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,650
Inline 28.

171
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,130
Basically creating this attribute object or editing this Ashby object of posts user.

172
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,150
So now that I've saved that let's send it back over and refreshed the page.

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,950
OK it looks like Jose.

174
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,450
I can see this is my first test post and it just says delete here let's try that.

175
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,410
Going to try to delete and looks like template does not exist.

176
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,570
Post delete one post.

177
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,370
Post based I aced team else so somewhere along the line we are getting a failure for post underscore

178
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,050
Bass says this template doesn't exist.

179
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,540
Let's head back and figure that out.

180
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,070
Then hop back over and let's confirm that we do have a post underscore bass so that looks good meaning

181
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,640
over here on the Confirm delete.

182
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,370
Probably something is happening here that's wrong and it says X10 posts.

183
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,390
Post a female looks like X only have double quotes there so let's delete those save it and then try

184
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,430
again see if that fixes the issue.

185
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,000
And there we go.

186
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,410
So it was just an issue of accidently having double quotes there and that extents call.

187
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,550
So it says Now are you sure you want to leave this post.

188
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,330
Let's try to confirm delete.

189
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,970
It looks like messages are not defined.

190
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,580
That probably means I didn't import messages.

191
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,570
So that's under it.

192
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:29,050
Views that py inline 70 going head over posts of used up by line 17 if you take a look at it.

193
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,340
Messages success.

194
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,720
I forgot to import that.

195
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:40,240
So save from Django and I believe from them contrib import messages save that come back here and I'm

196
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,320
going to refresh this continue and it looks like it delete that post.

197
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
Please try again to make sure that's working for US groups.

198
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,950
I see all the groups all come to first group or join that group and then I'm going to post to first

199
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,250
group this time.

200
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,500
OK so let's see if this is working.

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,310
Let's put this to first group.

202
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,030
Post it.

203
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,870
OK let's see it is working Jose and willing to delete this.

204
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,210
Are you sure you want to please post let's see if it's working confirmed delete.

205
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,700
It looks like deleted it now right now what's happening is the redirect is probably not working after

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,010
delete so we should definitely check that as well.

207
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,560
And if you notice off the posts it looks like the date or time stamp wasn't working as well.

208
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,700
So if we come back to groups let me add a post here so I'm going to.

209
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,310
Why not actually actually join it in this post.

210
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,060
So just say blah blah group second group post.

211
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,160
And now if I take a look at the groups I can see the second group has one post looks like the counting

212
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,040
is working and then it says right here at this post.

213
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,480
If I hit my Poso function I want to delete this.

214
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,680
Looks like it's working.

215
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,070
I'm going to cancel and see that it redirects here.

216
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,680
OK so it looks like we're able to post but notice that we're not getting a lot of the functionality

217
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,660
we thought we were going to get things like the date that the post was created that or my Jose isn't

218
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,520
actually linking to my profile and it's probably because we forgot to put some things either on this

219
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,070
particular template page or one of the templates It extends from or injects into.

220
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:18,300
So let's go back to our editor and you'll notice that for this page that would have been the user post

221
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,160
page or the Post confirmed.

222
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,190
Fact if we go back this is post by Jose.

223
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,090
Number three is actually the post detail page so posts underscore detail if we take a look at it essentially

224
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,990
just in Jecks underscore posts.

225
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,860
H m l.

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,750
Meaning all the issues are probably within underscore posts.

227
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,520
HTL.

228
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,630
So again coming back here I'm getting some issues at Jose I expect that to be clicking.

229
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,840
I expect this to probably say Jose instead of just Jose.

230
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,270
I don't know what this is doing there.

231
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,090
So there's still some problems here.

232
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,870
Let's come back and this page is directly what we're looking at since there shouldn't be any problems

233
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,090
here.

234
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,430
Just about five lines of code.

235
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,040
It's probably all an underscore post that takes him out so we'll go to underscore postdates HTML and

236
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,330
add some stuff in here.

237
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,980
The collapse is their victory tree.

238
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,680
It looks like we actually forgot to add in the text for these anchor tags which was probably a big oversight.

239
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,450
So let's do that now.

240
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,080
Underneath media heading these anchor tags should probably have something since they're linking to something.

241
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,750
So we will say at and then this will be the username.

242
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:27,440
So I will say postop user the user name save that let's go back and see if that affected something.

243
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:27,970
OK.

244
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:33,080
So there you see Jose and I don't really want this double Jose there so we'll come back here.

245
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,610
And then let's get rid of this so post user post username.

246
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,810
I'm going to just comment that out because I feel like I don't really need it now.

247
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,580
There we go so let's look looking a little better.

248
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,670
Come back up here.

249
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,140
And looks like the time isn't actually posting so let's do something there as well.

250
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,250
Insert here or inject post created at.

251
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,680
Remember those that property over time was created that save it and then I'm going to refresh.

252
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,550
OK.

253
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,290
Looks like we have creation Jose.

254
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,390
That's looking good.

255
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,120
We see that we still have this weird esque floating around there.

256
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,490
And if I refresh this page it's still there.

257
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,440
I can see it it's after the delete button.

258
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,200
So I try to confirm that it's an underscore post or if it's actually in the user post list.

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:25,450
So coming back here if I type something outside of this this is outside underscore post save that and

260
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,860
then refresh this page looks like that happens.

261
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,300
So outside underscore post which means this s is not part of the injection itself.

262
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,290
So that means the problem is not actually an underscore postdated demo.

263
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,740
So I'll save that and it should have been under user post list.

264
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:47,720
So clicking on user posts list I can see include and whip's looks like S was right here the whole time.

265
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,730
Delete that s.

266
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,880
Save this.

267
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,960
Come back here.

268
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,840
Refresh the page.

269
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,170
And now the S has gone looking good.

270
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,910
If I come back to start social that takes me to walk on the start social I can see a list of groups

271
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,820
first group second group and it looks like everything is working let's try creating a new user going

272
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,310
through all the actions and then verifying that everything is working.

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,300
So I will log out says Thanks for visiting come back soon.

274
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,390
Let's sign up actually before we do that let's see if we can view the groups without being logged in.

275
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,270
That's looking good.

276
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,240
First group no post in this group yet hit the groups over here.

277
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
There's one post and second group and there's the post itself.

278
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,740
OK that's looking pretty good then I'm going to sign up.

279
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,420
Will sign up as new.

280
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,050
Underscore user new shemale dot com.

281
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,750
This will be a test password.

282
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,910
Test password.

283
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,970
Sign up.

284
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,080
OK so I have new underscore user and I the same phosphorus Joses will just log in.

285
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:52,220
Ok now it says I'm logged in perfect and going to try to create a group and this will take me to my

286
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,370
new groups.

287
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,100
Make it really obvious brand new create.

288
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,960
Ok so my new group member count no posts in this group yet.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,850
Then again I am pretty zoomed in here so that's why it looks a little weird.

290
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,240
I'm going to join my own group and Elosha posting it.

291
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:18,110
So this is the first post in the group and then I'll go to my new group post and there it is.

292
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:24,130
This is the first post a new group new user interface a new user takes me to the same page.

293
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,340
So let's try exploring.

294
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:32,630
If I go to groups the second group that had a post buy at Home sales try looking at Jose and I can see

295
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,730
Jose's profile essentially it's like his profile or Twitter feed and I can see whatever post that this

296
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,830
person has done.

297
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,520
Perfect.

298
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,940
So it looks like all our functionality is working up coming up next.

299
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,950
We have to do is set up our CSSA files.

300
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,000
Kind of give this a nicer look OK we'll do that in the next lecture.

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,660
I'll see you there.
