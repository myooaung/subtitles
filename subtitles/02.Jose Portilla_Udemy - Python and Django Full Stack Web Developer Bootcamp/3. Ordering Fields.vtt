00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.520
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.110
And this lecture we're going to discuss ordering fields on the admin page now.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.090
By default the admin will display fields in the detail view in the same order they are defined in the

4
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.660
model.

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.000
We can easily change that with a few edits in the admin that py file.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.450
Let me show you how I'm first going to show you what the original default detail view looks like and

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.730
then show you how you can edit it.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.170
Let's hop over to our editor and our browser.

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.970
OK so I have my browser here open in front of my editor and I first want to show you the default views

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.430
for the models so we can think of it when we click customers and then we click on a particular customer.

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.570
I can see this detail view of that customer and then come back to videos that take a look at the movies

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.210
select the title of a movie.

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.490
I can see the title length release here now.

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.030
Maybe you want to have these in a different order right now.

15
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.120
By default they're in the same order that they are the finden in the model itself.

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.360
Let me show you how we can change the order of this detail view for these different fields.

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.740
We'll come back to videos and then we're going to move this browser aside and do the actual edits in

18
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.830
our Adam and that PI file.

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.740
So come over to Adam and up-I which is going to be underneath our application.

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.660
So under videos and that pie.

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.040
And so far we've just registered models the customer and models that movie in order to actually order

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.700
the fields.

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.380
We'd end up doing is you create a new class and this class is going to be called Movie admen and it's

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.910
going to inherit from admen the model admen.

25
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.310
Now this actual naming structure by convention what it should be is the name of your model and then

26
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.430
adamant attached to it.

27
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.550
So I want this class to be kind of in relation to this model's not movie class.

28
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.390
The other one we could say customer adamant that offer that we end up adding an attribute called fields

29
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.690
and the field is just a list.

30
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.070
Member list is a particular sequence of an index and it's going to be the actual fields of whatever

31
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.160
model you're referring to in this case movies.

32
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.050
And it puts them in the order you want.

33
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.570
So if we take a look at models right now and we take a look at a movie it has a title a length and release

34
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.210
year.

35
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.010
Let's try to make the release year the first thing and then have title and length afterwards.

36
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.360
So we'll come back to movie adman and we'll say Release your and then we'll say title and then we make

37
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.100
sure with the last one was it was length.

38
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.070
So we're going to save those changes.

39
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.480
And the last thing I want to do is we now want to register this class with along with the actual model

40
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.450
so we'll say models that movie and then Khama.

41
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.690
We're also going to register movie admen now save that and let's bring in our browser again.

42
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.270
So here's my browser.

43
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.770
I'm going to just refresh this.

44
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.670
Make sure those changes are good and will hit all movies hit on Indiana Jones.

45
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.390
And we notice now the release here is the first thing showed.

46
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.630
Then it goes title and then it goes length for this particular example.

47
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.040
It wasn't a big deal to change the orders but oftentimes you'll have some sort of relational field and

48
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.810
that will is going to be really useful to have at the top that we can kind of choose OK which other

49
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.750
model is it related to etc..

50
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.940
Hopefully you can see here you have full flexibility on the way you want to see these and where or do

51
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.220
you want to see these.

52
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.860
OK.

53
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.060
That's really all there is to it.

54
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.670
As a quick review all you end up doing is you create a new class with the name your model and then Adelman.

55
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.510
So that's by convention you inherit from admin model admin and then you create an attribute called fields

56
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.590
and then you just list the fields in the order you want them to appear in.

57
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.930
And then you register that along with your original model.

58
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.870
Thanks Ron and I'll see the next lecture.
