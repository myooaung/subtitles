Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture you have a challenge and it's a jingle template challenge.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,720
Templates is a big leap forward for us.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,330
So it's a good time to quickly get some practice using them and we're going to be using your older pro

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,530
to project they you created for the previous Shingo challenge.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,190
If you don't have that project anymore.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,360
Just quickly recreate it using the creating project commands and accreting application commands that

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,340
we've learned in previous lectures.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,110
Once you have that set up you want to go ahead and complete the following tasks.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,010
Create a template character and connect it to the settings that py file of that new second project.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,680
Then create a new view called help and use.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,290
You are all mapping to render it for any page with the extension slash help.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,630
So again you're going to go to your second project folder create that second new application create

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,460
a new view.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,970
So the function within that views that py file and use that you are all mapping that we've learned to

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,790
actually create a rendering for any page of the extension slash help.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,470
And then I want you to use template tags to return help page.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,830
So in the templates directory that you made create a new folder and within that folder there should

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,930
be something like help that H T.M. and then that should have template and template tags that basically

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,460
returns help page.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,290
So just get everything connected so that it's clear that you understand how to use templates to connect

21
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,100
to a view and actually inject code into the template HTL.

22
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,440
All right.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,450
Best of luck with that and the next lecture.

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,530
We will briefly code through the solution.

25
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,120
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
