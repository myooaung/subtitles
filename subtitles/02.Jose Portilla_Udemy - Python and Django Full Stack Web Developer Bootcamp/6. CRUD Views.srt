00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,310
Hello everyone and welcome to this final lecture we're going to be discussing credit.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,810
Now you may have heard of this term credit before in web development but what does it actually mean

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,390
contrary to what you might think it means.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:24,770
It really stands for create retrieve update and delete and this process of creating retrieving updating

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,640
and leading is inherent to almost every Web site.

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,830
Pretty much any web site with users has the ability for a user or an administrator to create content

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,020
retrieve prior content update that content or delete that content.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,180
Now we pretty much already know how to retrieve things by using the connection between the Urals the

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,390
models and the views the PI file.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,530
But we're going to be learning about here is more on creating updating and deleting information from

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,780
our web application.

12
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,630
Whenever you work of models and databases you'll need to perform those four basic actions and luckily

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,880
Django has class based views to simplify this entire process for you.

14
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,610
We'll start off by exploring how to use the Create view class.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,230
Now a quick note while we are using this create view class in the programming section of this lecture

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,070
we will purposefully induce a few errors to clarify where certain variable names are coming from.

17
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,600
So I'm not making mistakes as I'm coding along.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,340
I will actually be inducing those errors on purpose and I'll remind you of that as we continue programming

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,550
once we've worked through the create a view class working with the update view and delete the classes

20
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,270
will be very straightforward.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,570
In other quick note there's going to be a lot of interaction between your Urals not pi.

22
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,850
The used up high end models not pi file as well as all your template files.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,320
If you ever get stuck on an error I want you to triple check that your code has matching the notes exactly.

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,880
Or is matching what I've shown you here in the video lecture.

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,460
The nature of the interaction between all the files is going to make it almost impossible for me to

26
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,420
give you good help on this topic.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,860
In the Q&amp;A forums.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,680
So if you ever get stuck on anything and you're really stuck.

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,040
Make sure that you're actually following along with the video Exactly.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,160
Or just go ahead and download the associated files for this lecture.

31
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,520
All right let's get started.

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,540
Hop over to the Adam text editor.

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,730
OK here I am at the Adam text editor and over on the right I also have a browser open to the page so

34
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,490
you've been working with throughout this entire section of the course.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,480
I have the home page and we learned how to connect templates and also inject content into this home

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,090
page.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,240
I can click on schools see a list of all the schools select first school and then come to the school

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,550
detail page and then I can always click on admin to go to the admin page as well.

39
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,760
Let's go back to schools and we'll see a list of schools here.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,850
The first thing I want to do is show you how we could possibly create a new school using create you

41
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,150
in order to do that.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,550
Let's hop over to our views that py file under basic app and I'm going to create a new class that as

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,420
you may have guessed is going to be called School create view.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,940
So I will collapse this directory for a second.

45
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,750
And before we actually get started with this let's import the views we're going to be using.

46
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,270
Right now we're importing a view template view list view.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,510
Now what I can do is put these in multiple lines is have some parentheses here.

48
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,550
And anything wrapped inside is print seis and then go on multiple lines.

49
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,110
So when importing view template view list view detail view we're already familiar those.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:40,240
And then I'm also going to be importing create view update view and then delete view.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,550
And basically what these views are going to do and help us out with is create you will help us create

52
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,140
new additions to our models update is going to take an existing entry in your model and a light update

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,260
it and then delete view will take something that exists there and delete it.

54
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,010
So let's start off with create a view which is going to allow us to essentially create a new school

55
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,410
easily.

56
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,220
I will scroll down over here and underneath school detail to you.

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:16,480
I will say something like class school create view and then we'll just pass and create view will inherit

58
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,310
from that.

59
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:26,720
And then what I'm going to do under the Create view is I will say model is equal to models dot school

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,540
and then I will save that and whenever we creative you want to make sure that it's linked to some sort

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,730
of your l.

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,010
So I'll bring back my directory tree and come over to the Urals PI file of my actual application and

63
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm going to add another line there for you.

64
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,680
So let's actually edit this a little bit.

65
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,800
Right now I have this sort of regular expression and I going to simplify this instead of having this

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,590
in brackets here.

67
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,450
Let's just make the say digit plus.

68
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,150
And basically what this is doing is taking the primary key of the school as the display.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,210
And what I want to do is create a new york Airlink here

70
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:13,350
and this will take in as a regular expression just create forward slash dollar sign.

71
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,920
So what this says is if someone goes to the domain page slash basic app slash create it's going to allow

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:31,370
us to create a new school and here we'll save views dot school create view dot as View member we have

73
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,560
to do that for class based views and we'll go ahead and give it a name and the name we're going to give

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,590
it is just create so we can reference it later.

75
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,500
And since they added a new item to this list I want to make sure that they're separated by commas.

76
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,370
OK.

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,210
So just to expand this a little bit so he can see this in a tiny bit more detail here.

78
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,490
I've just added your L create views at school create as View name as create.

79
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,130
We're going to save that and then what we're going to do is check it out over here and we will get some

80
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,270
errors but I'm going to walk you through them so we can get a better understanding of why we're getting

81
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,730
these errors.

82
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,720
So I will come back to schools refresh and then I'll click on first school.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,490
It's the walk of the school detail page.

84
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:14,850
All right.

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,980
So far so good.

86
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:25,310
I'll come back up here to where it says basic app and I'm going to try to go to create enter and note

87
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,330
what happens here.

88
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,500
It says improperly configured at basic app create using model for mixin based classes school create

89
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,170
view without the fields attribute is prohibited.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,260
So that's the error I want you to learn how to read.

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,260
In case you ever encounter it.

92
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:48,930
So basically what this is saying is hey you want to create a view but you didn't specify what fields

93
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,750
are prohibited and what fields are allowed.

94
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,130
Well that's easy enough to fix.

95
00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:00,060
We'll come back to the used up high and over here under create just like we did back when we're working

96
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,090
with models.

97
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,960
We're going to find the fields that will allow a user to create.

98
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,520
So the school had three main fields the name the principal and location.

99
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,990
And this almost acts like a security measure.

100
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:20,890
Maybe you don't want someone to edit the location of a school or the name of the school etc. we'll just

101
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,730
pass in all the fields for now.

102
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:35,010
Principal and then location and I'm going to save this and as I refreshed this page I should see probably

103
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,820
another error.

104
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,080
And there it is so template does not exist.

105
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,700
Well that makes sense I never actually created a template for the school creation page.

106
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:50,100
But what's interesting here is it tells you that it's looking for basic app school form.

107
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:57,220
And basically what that means is that Django that create view is automatically creating a default HVM

108
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,600
l template that it's expecting and it's expecting it to be in the format of all lowercase.

109
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,520
The model name.

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,250
In our case at school underscore and then form so let's that in.

111
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,820
And I would always suggest that you use the defaults there.

112
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:19,830
So underneath templates basic app I will create a new file and I will call it what it was looking for

113
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,640
school underscore form that each TNL and it makes sense that we need some sort of form for the editor

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,540
or user to come in and create a new school and let's show you how we can create the school form page.

115
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:43,680
First things first though I want to say extends from the basic app slash and then the basic app base

116
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,270
which was basic app underscore based but each T.M..

117
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,260
OK so that's going to allow me to extend that template and then let's have in our body block tool called

118
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,990
block body underscore block.

119
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,780
And since I have a block I will say and block as well.

120
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:06,930
All right.

121
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,790
Now it's actually put some thing here and this is what the user is going to see when they actually try

122
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,280
to create a new school.

123
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,380
And I'm going to essentially think ahead and know that I am also going to add an update view later on.

124
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,530
So keep that in mind as I'm working here.

125
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,920
Usually you wouldn't just know this off the top of your head.

126
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,670
And then this header or heading one on point to use some logic.

127
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:42,660
Have an if statement and my template tagging and I will say if Knot's form the instance dot piqué and

128
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,320
we'll explain what that means in a little bit.

129
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,420
I will say create school

130
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,480
and then since I know I'm also going to add an update view later on meaning update a school that already

131
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,070
exists.

132
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,130
I will say else

133
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:11,550
update school and then since I haven't if I always need to and if so do these lines actually mean.

134
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:18,150
Well basically what I'm saying is the following I am going to extend from basic app have the body block

135
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:25,050
and the heading of this form page that create page is going to check if the instance of the primary

136
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,570
key exists or not.

137
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,260
If it does not exist that means this is a new school.

138
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,930
Now we're going to create the school.

139
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,650
Otherwise we're updating a school that currently exists.

140
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,440
And this will make more sense as we actually developed the update view.

141
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,230
Hopefully you get the basic idea that I'm checking first.

142
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,200
There's a primary that's here that school exists.

143
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,180
Well in that case if it doesn't exist I'm creating a school.

144
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,120
Else if it already does exist then I'm updating the school.

145
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,000
And then finally to actually update school we need to take in a form some information and we actually

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,150
just need to specify the method is post.

147
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,350
We don't need to have a class or action here.

148
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,430
You could have a class with this bootstraps stuff we've been learning about but we'll keep it simple

149
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,380
for now.

150
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,120
As always of any form we need to have our C S R F tokin C S or of Tokin and this should be underscore

151
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,920
tokin

152
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:33,860
and then we're going to inject our form as we've seen earlier as P and then finally we'll say input.

153
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,050
The type is going to be a submit button and let's give it a class.

154
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,700
So it looks a little nicer since we are working a bootstrap.

155
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,470
We'll say it's a BT and B 10 cash primary.

156
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:54,290
Always nice to flex those bootstrap muscles and let's give it a value of Samit we'll save that and hopefully

157
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,900
that worked out this error.

158
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,680
Remember that was the school for that age T.M. and it's really important that you have the ability to

159
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,230
read these sort of errors throughout the course we've been kind of avoiding errors to begin with but

160
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,170
now I really want you to get familiar and be able to read oh template does not exist.

161
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,370
Well that means I need to check out with templates expecting.

162
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,310
All right let's refresh this and perfec we see create a school.

163
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,710
Now let's try to actually create a school.

164
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:28,940
We'll give it the name of the school my brand new school the principal will be I don't know someone

165
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,100
named Larry and the location will say it's in.

166
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,810
I don't know Panama will say submit and boom we have another problem.

167
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,660
It says improperly configured at basic at underscore app create and it says has no your L to read direct

168
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,680
to either provided your l or.

169
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:57,380
And what we're going to be doing the define a get underscore absolute underscore your L method on the

170
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,210
model.

171
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,220
So let's follow those directions and actually do it.

172
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:09,430
OK so I'm going to come over to the models and I'm going to look for school and it told me that I should

173
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,270
define a get absolute Your L method for this model so as follows instructions.

174
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:24,150
I'll say if I get absolute's underscore you are l or pasand self.

175
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:31,500
And then we're going to do is basically reverse and tell it what primary key we want this school to

176
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,250
be created with.

177
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:40,080
So here it is actually import reverse from your resolvers which we have seen before.

178
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:46,240
Say from Jingo that Corda you are l resolvers.

179
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:57,750
Import loops reverse and that means I can use it down here where I will just return reverse and what

180
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:05,590
I am going to do here is called Basic underscore app the detail view not the detail viewers and the

181
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,860
importing but the actual detail and the views that py file.

182
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,360
And then we need to add some keyword arguments as a parameter and the keyword argument in past here

183
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:29,040
is Piquet for primary key and the value for that is just self-taught P.K..

184
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,850
So let's save that.

185
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,410
And again learning how to kind of read and roll the punches on some of these error codes so it does

186
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,780
get absolutely oral method.

187
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,160
We did that already.

188
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,140
Let's refresh this.

189
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,660
It may ask us to continue.

190
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,680
That's fine.

191
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,680
Says Walk to School detail page school details my brand new school.

192
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,340
Larry in Panama.

193
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,460
So what was actually going on here.

194
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,510
Basically what happened is after we created that view we never told Django where it should go to.

195
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,640
We never said oh go do something after you created the view which is why Gyngell was requesting for

196
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,430
a get absolute Your L.

197
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,010
And basically what we said is OK go back and reverse and figure out that you should go to the detail

198
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,300
page or whatever the primary key is of the school you just made.

199
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,850
In our case this is basic app for your number maybe different however and that's the very basics of

200
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,500
having a create view.

201
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,010
So if I go back to the list of schools I can see I have my brand new school in my brand new school.

202
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,480
So the reason it's inserted twice here is because we basically did it twice while we were kind of fixing

203
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,790
some of those errors.

204
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,840
But don't worry we'll fix that when we learn how to delete views.

205
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,030
But first let's learn how to work with up few.

206
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,200
And a lot of the work is actually have already been done for us since we did a lot of stuff we were

207
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,060
doing the Create view.

208
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,930
So school of the view should actually be quite simple as well.

209
00:15:51,180 --> 00:16:02,160
Let's come over to views that pi and I will create a new class called school up view.

210
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,330
And I would recommend that you name your classes.

211
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,180
Basically the way I'm doing it with the model name and then create your view or detail view etc. and

212
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,540
then I'm going to inherit from up the view.

213
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,280
And this one's quite simple.

214
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,500
Again we're going to specify what fields we want to be updated.

215
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,610
Now this is where maybe you can think about OK who's going to be updating this.

216
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,090
What kind of user permissions will they have and also what makes sense for updating a school.

217
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,740
Does it make sense to up the school's principal.

218
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,800
Well yeah that makes sense.

219
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,390
Principals can change because it makes sense to update the school's name.

220
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,200
Maybe.

221
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,640
What about the location of school.

222
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,590
Well probably not schools usually don't move around that much so let's just say you can only update

223
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,170
the name and the principal of a school.

224
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,960
Obviously your own situations are going to be unique and you'll have to make that call.

225
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,460
And what we're going to do here is once we have this we'll just connected to the model will say models

226
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,660
equal to models thought and in our case it's the school model.

227
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,740
We'll save this and then we're going to do is come back to your Allsopp pie and actually set up a your

228
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:19,490
L for our updating inside this your PI file for application 1 I'm going to do is copy this detail view

229
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,870
paste that again and this is basically the same view I want except I want to clarify some sort of update

230
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,960
extension.

231
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:34,250
So basically if I go to basic underscore app slash up they slash and then the number of the primary

232
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,550
key of the school.

233
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:42,220
It will let me update that school so I need to change this from detail view to update view as View.

234
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,800
And then it will change the name to detail.

235
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:55,080
To update and then let me save that and the next thing we have to do is actually edit the HTML file

236
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,820
or the template file that relates the school detail page.

237
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:06,010
So let's hop over to that and right now this is our detail page and it just says for the information

238
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,630
of school to students etc. and what we will do.

239
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:18,120
Is outside of this fact let's put it outside this div but before the end block I'll create a new div

240
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,610
inside its own container.

241
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:29,730
It'll just be a paragraph with an anchor tag inside of it and this will be your template and this will

242
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:40,410
be a template that takes you to the basic underscore app was the name of the and will pass in an argument.

243
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:52,420
P.K. school underscore detail that Piquet and let's actually give this a class so it looks a little

244
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,080
nicer.

245
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:02,310
Will say this is class of her bootstrap we can say between will give it warning you give it success

246
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,410
whatever you want but maybe awarning makes sense to update something.

247
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,850
It's kind of a yellow hue by original nature and then we actually want to have some sort of texture

248
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,940
that tells you what you're going to update this.

249
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,300
All right let's save this and will refresh this page and see what happens.

250
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,400
So now if I scroll down a little bit I see this update button and we can always zoom out so it's a little

251
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,210
more clear.

252
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,060
So now on the detail page I can see the update button.

253
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,930
You may have to scroll down depending on how zoomed in you are.

254
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,940
If I click on it I get the form and the option to update the school and only the fields that I specify

255
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,850
the name and principal.

256
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,580
So let's try to change the name of the school.

257
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:50,190
Actually this is change the principal to something really obvious like Mr. obvious I should be really

258
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,190
obvious change will submit it and it takes back to that school's detail page.

259
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,620
That's what we were working with when we said here on the ref your L basic app update and then Piquet's

260
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,680
school detail.

261
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,450
OK.

262
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,020
That allows us to link whatever school we're actually updating with.

263
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,040
So what the school page I can see now for school has principal Mr Obvious.

264
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,740
And if I come back to schools click on for school I can see that that change has been permanently done

265
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,010
great.

266
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,920
So now you learn how to create views and how to update views.

267
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,470
The last thing they need to do is figure out how we can delete views.

268
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:33,280
So let's go back to our actual editor our bringing back my directory tree and what I'm going to do is

269
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:43,430
come over here to the views up high and we'll create our last and final view which is the school Dilley

270
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:51,340
view we'll have delete view here and this is going to be slightly different from everything we've done

271
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,420
so far.

272
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,450
As far as updating and creating views that it's actually not so bad.

273
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,070
First we have to do is say model is equal to models.

274
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,860
School connect the models that makes sense as far as what we're going to delete.

275
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,260
And then the next thing I have to add in is a success your L variable or attribute I should say because

276
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,720
this is a class so will create an attribute called success.

277
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Underscore your L and what we're going to do is use the reverse underscore lazy function.

278
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,560
So I need to go up and import that and I'll explain what it is.

279
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:36,280
Right after I import it we'll say from jingo dot core dot.

280
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,870
You are all resolvers and it's actually from the same place we imported reverse from so we can import

281
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,560
reverse or reverse underscore lazy.

282
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,540
And if you're familiar of programming you may have heard of the term lazily evaluated and what we're

283
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,820
going to do is all the way down here and it's actually telling us we need to still finish that off where

284
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:07,200
it says success you IRL we will call reverse underscore lazy and passen that we want to go to the basic

285
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,560
app and the list view.

286
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,990
So what does success means is all right.

287
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Once you successfully deleted a school I want you to go back to the list page of the basic app and show

288
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,870
all the schools and theoretically once you're done deleting that school should no longer be on that

289
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,890
list.

290
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,210
The reason we use reverse lazy is that we don't want this evaluated completely when running our PI file.

291
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,380
We only wanted to wait until it's actually called as a success.

292
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,830
And as with all the other views we've been working with we need to go ahead and add a Oreilles that

293
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,120
PI that actually matches with this particular view.

294
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,530
So we'll come back here to your Elle's that pie and let me collapses to see a little more room.

295
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,370
And again this is going to look really similar to update.

296
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,830
Instead of updating something though we're going to be deleting it so we'll hit enter and I'm going

297
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,730
to change this name from Update to delete.

298
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,340
I'll change this update to daily as well.

299
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,530
And then here it says update will change that to delete.

300
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,170
So I should be able to go to basic app slash delete and then any primary key and start getting some

301
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,370
options for deleting stuff.

302
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,860
But in order to do that I should have some sort of HTL file.

303
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,500
So will go ahead and go with the default H-2 him Al file that's expected.

304
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,600
We'll add it in right now.

305
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,630
We don't see those errors anymore.

306
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:39,200
Now all we do is we say school underscore confirm underscore delete that H Tim L and this is going to

307
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,300
be the page that's actually shown.

308
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,440
When someone tries to manually delete something from the database

309
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:58,260
we'll say extends and we're going to go from the basic slash basic app underscore based studies Tim

310
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,620
Ehle file that I have here

311
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,060
and the start our block

312
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,010
will have our body block.

313
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,250
Now if any block we need to and the block

314
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:27,060
and where we're going to have here is basically just says H-1 and we'll say delete and it will automatically

315
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:33,360
pass in a context object called school or whatever the lowercase version of your model is.

316
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,680
Remember we previously covered how to create your own context object names.

317
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,950
You come back here to views and scroll up a little bit.

318
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,700
We talked about it here context object name.

319
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,530
The basic one for detail that I encouraged each use default is the lowercase version of your model.

320
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:56,330
So we use that we expect school to be here and we're going to call off of it is the name and say questionmark.

321
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,210
So this is going to show is a heading that says hey delete that school's name Question Mark and then

322
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,240
we'll just have a simple form.

323
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:14,760
The simple form is just going to say method is post with any form we always need a C SRF token

324
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,100
and it's going to have an input.

325
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:28,220
The input would just be submit and now it can kind of play the classes of bootstrap.

326
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,630
And I've been waiting to use this a long time but we can finally use the danger button.

327
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,730
We don't actually give this a name but we should give it a value that way it says something we'll just

328
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,380
have it say delete and below this.

329
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,440
If you don't want to delete.

330
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,880
We should have some sort of link that goes back to cancel or at least some sort of text.

331
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,880
You can have this be a button in other form whatever you want are you going to have it be an anchor

332
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,090
tag with the word cancel inside of it.

333
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:04,210
And for the ref will have it take us back to that school's detail page.

334
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:11,800
So I have a template here that goes to basic app whatever the name of your application is detail that

335
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,460
your URL.

336
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:20,090
And then we'll say P.K. is equal to school dot primary key.

337
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,110
So again we're grabbing the primary key off that school context object that's returned just the same

338
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:32,340
way we grabbed that name because remember that detail your L if we go back to your Elle's that pie over

339
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,270
here under the term detail we're expecting some sort of primary key to be inserted which is why we then

340
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,820
having to pass it in as an argument in these HTL template files.

341
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:52,160
Ok so let's save this and we'll refresh our schools page and let's go ahead and try to delete school

342
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,970
number four because I have a duplicate there.

343
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:04,050
So up here in the your L I will say basic app deletes forward slash for enter and it says delete my

344
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,190
brand new school.

345
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,410
And I can see here we can click Cancel which is going to take us back to that detail page of that particular

346
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,410
school or I can hit delete so.

347
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,580
We'll hit delete.

348
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,290
And there you go.

349
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,940
That school has now been deleted.

350
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,190
Let's try one more time make sure it's actually working.

351
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,710
Try and that other brand new school and we actually need to enter this manually later on you can add

352
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,900
links if you want.

353
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:33,270
Obviously you should be very careful adding delete links all over the place the here and delete slash

354
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,450
3 delete my brain new school and we'll hit delete.

355
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,210
OK.

356
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,620
Perfect.

357
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,700
That's all working.

358
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,730
Later on we'll also learn how to use slugs instead of just primary keys where slugs are essentially

359
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,680
the name of objects lower lowercase with dashes in between any spaces.

360
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,220
And if you're familiar for development at all you've probably heard that term before.

361
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,120
OK.

362
00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:00,150
I hope you enjoyed learning about updating creating and deleting views and I hope that this makes your

363
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,090
life a lot easier as you find yourself programming of larger projects and Django.

364
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,470
You're going to be using those views all the time.

365
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,940
And that's basically the whole point of Django to make your life a little easier as you try to focus

366
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,950
on what's really important developing your own web site.

367
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,650
Thanks and I'll see it the next lecture.
