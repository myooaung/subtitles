Welcome back everyone to this lecture on adding filters so we can also add filters for Adam in view

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,050
of our models and filters will automatically show up on the right hand side of the view and they will

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,460
also auto filter the printing on the data type.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,620
And I'll explain more about that later on.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,280
Keep in mind not every field will be useful as a filter.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,580
Let's explore how to easily create filters for admin views and hop over back to the editor.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,160
OK here I am at my admen PI file and if you notice what we have right now for bring in over my browser

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,220
is if I'm selecting videos then check out the movies.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,370
I see a list of movies and I can search them and then I can also add movies here when I want to do is

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,760
if we come back to home.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,270
Notice how the built in users has a filter filter by staffs that is super Beezer status active etc.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,000
so I can filter based off these different fields.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm going to show you how to add in those kind of filters for your own models.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,670
On the admin page so to do that it's actually really simple.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,690
All you need to do is in this class that we created and you can do this for any model that you may just

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,490
create another class such as customer admin.

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,920
The attribute you need to add in is called Whoops list underscore filter and then you just added the

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,570
list of things you want to filter by so different attributes of your model that you can filter by.

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,030
So for movies what might make sense is filtering by for instance a release year or filtering by the

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,500
genre.

21
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,180
Or maybe even the length etc..

22
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,500
Well probably does not make sense of filter by is the title.

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,010
So I get to add all of these as filters that you can get an idea of how this actually works and why

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,960
some of these choices are probably not good choices for filters.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,910
So I bring back my movies over here and I'm going to refresh.

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,030
Now I can see over here on the right hand side let me kind of expand this.

27
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,490
You can see it on the right hand side over here.

28
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,500
We zoom in a bit.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,780
I can see by filter so filtering by really cear that may make sense because you know there's different

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,850
or multiple movies per release year by length that could also make sense depending if things are standard

31
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,310
length or not by title.

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,750
Doesn't really make sense because titles probably a unique ID in this model so you don't want just kind

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,720
of hundreds of titles here.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,670
So usually I want to filter by some sort of categorical attribute of your model where many movies or

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,190
many objects are going to fit to that category.

36
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,370
OK so that's how you can easily add in a filter and that's really all there is to it.

37
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,710
As a quick review it's just an attribute of lists underscore filter.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
And then the actual attributes you want to filter by.

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,910
OK thanks everyone and I'll say at the next lecture.
