1
00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:05,507
We'll start off by taking a walk through our MovieRank application,

2
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:09,011
looking at what code we have removed relating to the Object

3
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:12,518
Persistence model that we created in the last module.

4
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:16,137
We are removing this code ready so we can add the

5
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,576
document model equivalent code.

6
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:23,725
We'll be adding the code to get all items from our database,

7
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:26,376
the ability to get a specific movie using only the

8
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,680
first letter or word of a movie name,

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,880
we will get what movies a user has ranked based on the movie name,

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,951
we will add the ability to allow all users to rank movies,

11
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:42,372
we will also allow them to update an already-ranked movie,

12
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:45,411
so they are able to update the ranking,

13
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:49,916
we want the ability to get an overall movie ranking,

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:57,000
taking in all user's rankings and then providing us with the average of those rankings.
