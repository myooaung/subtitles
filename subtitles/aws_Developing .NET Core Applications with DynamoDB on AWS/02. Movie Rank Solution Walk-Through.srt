1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,610
Just like we did when starting work on the document model,

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,932
we will first take a walk through our MovieRank application,

3
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:14,242
looking at what code we have removed that relates to the document model.

4
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:17,911
We are removing this code really so we can add the

5
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:19,482
low-level model equivalent code.

6
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:24,193
We want the ability to allow our users to get all items from our data,

7
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:29,782
to get a specific movie using only the first letter or first word of the movie,

8
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:34,638
we want to get what movies a user has ranked based on the movie name,

9
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,533
we allow our users to rank movies,

10
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:41,011
we will also allow them to update an already-ranked movie,

11
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,264
so they are able to update their ranking,

12
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:49,424
we want the ability to get an overall movie ranking,

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,389
taking in all user's rankings and then providing us

14
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:54,585
with the average of those rankings.

15
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:55,665
As mentioned earlier,

16
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:59,967
the low-level model is the only model where we can create and delete tables.

17
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:08,103
So we will add the ability to create and delete DynamoDB tables.

18
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:12,710
Inside our application, if we start off inside our MovieRankRepository class,

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,906
you will see that I have removed all code in this class and interface.

20
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:20,562
The MovieRankRepository class is the main class where

21
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:23,172
we'll be adding the low-level model code.

22
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:25,655
Jumping over to our Mapper class,

23
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:30,336
I have also removed the code from this class and interface.

24
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:36,108
If we look inside our MovieRankService class, I have left most code as is.

25
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,760
Inside the AddMovie method,

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,168
we now call off directly to the MovieRankRepository class.

27
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:50,014
We have removed the code needed to map our request into our DynamoDB object.

28
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:53,942
I've done the same thing for the UpdateMovie method as well.

29
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:59,023
We will now call off directly to the MovieRankRepository class.

30
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:00,299
Inside our GetMovieRank method,

31
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,145
I've replaced the existing code to work out the overall

32
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:11,000
average with the code that will work based on the response that we get back from DynamoDB.
