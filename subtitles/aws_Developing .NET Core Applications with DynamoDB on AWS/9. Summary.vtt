00:00:02.488 --> 00:00:03.268
In this module,

2
00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:07.463
we looked at and spoke about the DynamoDB Object Persistence model.

3
00:00:07.463 --> 00:00:10.915
We implemented inside our application the following endpoints,

4
00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:16.541
we added the ability to get all items from our database,

5
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.858
we allowed a user to get a specific movie,

6
00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:25.689
we also added the ability to get user's ranked movies based on the movie title,

7
00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.712
we allowed users to add a movie with a ranking,

8
00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:31.755
and we also allowed them to update a movie's ranking.

9
00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:37.995
We finally allowed a user to get back an overall movie ranking.

10
00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:45.000
In our next module, we swap out the Object Persistence code for the document models code.
