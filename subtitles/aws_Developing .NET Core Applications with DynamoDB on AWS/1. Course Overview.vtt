Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.821
My name is Daniel Donbavand,

3
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:10.261
and welcome to my Pluralsight course on Developing .NET

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:14.423
Core Applications with DynamoDB on AWS.

5
00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:18.105
This course will teach you how to build a real‑world ASP.NET Core

6
00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:23.881
application working with items in Amazon Web Service's DynamoDB.

7
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.775
Some of the major topics that we'll cover are creating a

8
00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:30.491
DynamoDB table inside the AWS Management Console,

9
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:35.620
setting up a brand‑new ASP.NET Core application.

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.161
The DynamoDB SDK for .NET has three models that allows us to

11
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.885
interact with DynamoDB from within our application.

12
00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:45.787
We'll cover all three models,

13
00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:49.688
including the differences between them and how to implement

14
00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:51.626
them inside our .NET Core application.

15
00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:56.821
Adding tests is an important part of creating any application.

16
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.292
I'll show you how we can create integration tests using an

17
00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:05.049
in‑memory test server and a local instance of DynamoDB.

18
00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.993
At the end of this course,

19
00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:09.016
you'll be comfortable creating a .NET Core application,

20
00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:15.014
implementing any of the three DynamoDB SDK for .NET models,

21
00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:18.763
and creating an integration test framework using an in‑memory

22
00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:23.656
test server and local instance of DynamoDB.

23
00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:24.672
Before beginning this course,

24
00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:30.651
I recommend that you are familiar with C# and object‑oriented programming.

25
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:32.111
I'm really excited about this course,

26
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:43.000
and I hope that you'll join me in learning how to create a .NET Core application with DynamoDB on AWS.
