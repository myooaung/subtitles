00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.080
In order for us to register our test

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.420
implementations against existing interfaces,

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.740
we want to create a CustomWebApplicationFactory class.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.840
This will allow us to test implementations, such as

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.340
the local DynamoDB implementation.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.500
Inside our Setup folder, we'll create a CustomWebApplicationFactory class.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.340
This class we want to inherit from the WebApplicationFactory.

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.070
The WebApplicationFactory allows us to streamline the bootstrapping of our

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.530
system under test with test server. We want to pass through our Startup class to

10
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.760
this class, so we'll make this generic with the type TStartup. Inside our

11
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.830
CustomWebApplicationFactory class, we want to register the local Dynamo DB

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.240
instance to our IAmazonDynamoDB interface.

13
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.460
If we remember,

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.610
we registered this inside our Startup class in our

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.720
solution. For our integration tests,

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.640
we want to register this against our local instance of DynamoDB.

17
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.100
We need to create a protected method with the

18
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.740
override keyword named ConfigureWebHost.

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.450
Inside these parameters, we'll add the IWebHostBuilder. In our method,

20
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.010
we start off by calling the builder and use the method that's a part

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.730
of the builder named ConfigureTestServices. Using Lambda, we can say

22
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.460
services, then services.AddSingleton. We want to register our

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.630
IAmazonDynamoDB interface, and we want to register this with our test

24
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.240
DynamoDB instance.

25
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.740
Let's create an AmazonDynamoDBConfig,

26
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.970
and we'll set the ServiceURL to point to our local

27
00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:02.000
DynamoDB. We can then add the AmazonDynamoDBClient and pass in the config that we just created.
