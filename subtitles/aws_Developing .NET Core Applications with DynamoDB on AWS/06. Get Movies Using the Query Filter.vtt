00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:03.639
Inside our Controller class,

2
00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.523
we will add the code needed to get all movies that a user

3
00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:10.416
has ranked using the userId and movieName.

4
00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.522
This is like our previous endpoint that we have just created,

5
00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:19.934
but this time we want to use a query filter with a condition of BeginsWith.

6
00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.570
This will allow the user to query a movie they have ranked by entering only

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.890
the first letter or first word of a movie they have ranked.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.500
We are able to use the code we created previously in our Controller class,

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.308
so we won't change anything in here.

10
00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:38.128
Over to our MovieRankService class,

11
00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:41.149
we'll call off to our MovieRankRepository class,

12
00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.049
and then map the items that we get back from DynamoDB

13
00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.473
into our MovieResponseContract.

14
00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:48.697
Again,

15
00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:51.667
we're using the same code that we created previously when

16
00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.591
implementing the Object Persistence model.

17
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.452
Inside our MovieRankRepository class,

18
00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:03.377
we want to add a method that has a return type of Task IEnumerable Document,

19
00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:08.455
and name our method GetUsersRankedMovieByMovieTitle,

20
00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:14.669
and add our userId and movieName to the method's parameters.

21
00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:17.498
Inside our method, we'll create a new query filter,

22
00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:21.357
and we'll add userId with a Query operator of Equals,

23
00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:24.846
and pass in our userId argument.

24
00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:28.593
We also need to add a filter condition of MovieName

25
00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:33.601
and a QueryOperator of BeginsWith, movieName.

26
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.481
Using DynamoDB's Query method,

27
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:45.000
we'll pass in the filter that we've just created and say GetRemainingAsync. We will add this method to our interface.
