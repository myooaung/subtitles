00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,450
It's really important that we have tests that run against our code

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,130
to make sure that everything is working as expected. In this module,

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,240
we used a local instance of DynamoDB.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,250
This allowed us to test our endpoints against the local

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,550
instance of DynamoDB without the need to connect to and use

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,740
our AWS instance of our DynamoDB table.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,470
This saves us costs, time, and removes the risk of

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,340
accidentally changing our production data.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,340
We created the classes needed to spin up an inâ€‘memory instance of

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,860
our application to run our tests against. We then created some

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,000
tests that allowed us to test each of our endpoints that we created in our movie rank application.
