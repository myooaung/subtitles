1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,718
Let's now have a look at how we can use the DynamoDB document model.

2
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:09,817
Previously, we were using the Object Persistence model.

3
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:13,997
This model allowed us to map our classes that we had created

4
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:18,278
in our application to our DynamoDB tables.

5
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:19,346
Out of the three models,

6
00:00:19,346 --> 00:00:23,853
the Object Persistence model requires us to write the least amount of code.

7
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:26,757
The document model still wraps the low-level model,

8
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:31,388
but we are required to write a little more code to add,

9
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:32,406
load, and query.

10
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,554
If we have a look at our MovieRank solution,

11
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:40,198
I have removed all of the code relating to DynamoDB's Object Persistence model.

12
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:43,473
Let's have a look around our solution to see what code I've

13
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:45,554
left then and what code I've removed.

14
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:49,313
I haven't touched anything inside our MovieController class.

15
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:53,786
We can reuse all the code that we have created previously.

16
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,792
Inside the MovieService class,

17
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:59,906
I've renamed a couple of the methods that we were using to map our request

18
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:04,778
that a user was making to the model that DynamoDB expects.

19
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:08,364
Previously, we were mapping our object into our MovieDb model,

20
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:13,656
whereas now we need to map our object to DynamoDB's document model.

21
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:18,136
These name changes happen in AddMovie and UpdateMovie.

22
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:21,517
I've also deleted the code that we used to get the

23
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:24,270
overall ranking of the specific movie.

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,314
This is due to the fact that to get items from the

25
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,429
response that we get back from DynamoDB,

26
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,379
we need to change this code slightly.

27
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:38,402
We will cover what the changes are when we get to implementing this endpoint.

28
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,215
I've deleted all methods inside our Mapper class.

29
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:45,326
We will cover how to map out items to our contracts as we go through

30
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:48,384
implementing our DynamoDB document model code.

31
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:52,308
I've deleted all methods and code inside our MovieRankRepository class,

32
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:55,597
as this is the main class that we'll be changing to

33
00:01:55,597 --> 00:02:05,000
work with DynamoDB's document model. I've also deleted the MovieDb model that we created previously.
