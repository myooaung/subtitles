00:00:02.354 --> 00:00:05.312
We will continue on with our GetMovie endpoint.

2
00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:07.884
If we start off in our MovieController class,

3
00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:09.282
nothing is changing here,

4
00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.160
so we can follow the code path over to our MovieRankService class,

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.786
where we have a call to our MovieRankRepository to get a movie

6
00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:21.256
back based on the composite primary key,

7
00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:24.442
the userId, and movieName.

8
00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:29.486
We then map the items that we get back from DynamoDB to our MovieContract.

9
00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:34.735
Inside our MovieRankRepository class,

10
00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:38.025
we want to create a method with the return type of Task Document,

11
00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:41.678
and well call our method name GetMovie.

12
00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:46.755
This method will have two parameters, our userId and movieName.

13
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.999
We will then use the GetItemAsync method,

14
00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:54.554
and pass in the userId and the movieName.

15
00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.815
Remember that when using the Get method,

16
00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:00.764
we have to pass in the partition key, and if we have one set,

17
00:01:00.764 --> 00:01:06.000
a sort key as well. We'll add this method to our interface.
