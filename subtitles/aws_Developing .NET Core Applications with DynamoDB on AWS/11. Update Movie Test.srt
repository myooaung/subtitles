1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,520
For our next test,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,950
we will test our update movie endpoint. Our method name will

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,640
be UpdateMovieReturnsUpdatedMovieRankValue.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,840
We will create three constants to set a userId, movieName, and a ranking.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,240
We will call our AddMovieRankData method to add our dummy data.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,130
We want to new up our MovieUpdateRequest and set the movie name to our

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,840
movie name we have added and also the updated ranking.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,630
We want to serialize our object and create a StringContent. We then

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,630
want to call our updateMovie endpoint and pass in our updated

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,790
ranking. In order to check that the value has been updated, we want

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,680
to use our getMovie endpoint and pass in the movie name that we

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,040
used to add our movie.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,570
We will deserialize our response and we'll assert that the ranking that we get

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:10,000
back is the ranking we have passed in to our updateMovie endpoint. Again, we'll run all of our tests and they're all passing.
