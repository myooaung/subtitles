00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.020
When creating our application in the previous modules,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.840
we have been talking to our DynamoDB table inside AWS.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.820
While this is fine to run and test our application against, we'll

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.350
be using the read and write capacity that we set when creating our

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.610
table. Depending on how many tests you are running and how often,

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.040
this can increase costs.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.730
It's also important to note that when you have a

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.020
production DynamoDB table set up,

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.240
it's unlikely that you'll want to run your tests against this table.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.610
We would want to create another table to test against. AWS provides us

11
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.640
with a way to spin up a local instance of DynamoDB.

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.470
Even better,

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.230
they have provided us with the Docker image that allows us to spin up a

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.250
DynamoDB instance inside a Docker container. We'll be using this local

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.640
DynamoDB Docker instance to run our tests against.

16
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.060
We first need to ensure we have Docker set up, ready for us

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.540
to run our local instance of DynamoDB.

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:14.720
If we head along to docs.docker.com/docker‑for‑windows/install/, this page

19
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.670
gives us the instructions needed to download and install Docker for Windows.

20
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.570
Once you have downloaded and installed Docker,

21
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.700
you'll want to make sure it's running. Inside Command

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.340
Prompt, if we type docker ‑‑version,

23
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.940
you should be returned the Docker version that is installed on your computer.

24
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.310
This shows us that Docker is installed and running. We'll come

25
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.000
back to Docker and the commands that we'll be using to run our local instance of DynamoDB shortly.
