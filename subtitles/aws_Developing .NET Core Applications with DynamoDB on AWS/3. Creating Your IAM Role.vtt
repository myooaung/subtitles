00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.760
We now need to create an IAM role.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.030
An IAM role allows us to create credentials that we can use outside of the

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.140
AWS console to gain access to services in our AWS account.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.810
In our case,

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.820
we want to create and give access to our Movie Rank DynamoDB table. Inside the

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
AWS console, if we enter into the AWS services search box,

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.440
IAM in selector, we are taken to the Identity and Access Management page.

8
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.010
We will select users in the leftâ€‘hand menu and then Add user. In the

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.480
User name text box, we will name our user MovieRank, and we'll also

10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.640
select the Programmatic access checkbox.

11
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.580
Selecting this option will give us access and secret keys that

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.540
we'll need to add to our credentials file.

13
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.760
We will now select Next. Under Set permissions, we will create a group,

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.080
a group named DynamoDBFullAccess. In the Filter

15
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.930
policies, we will search for DynamoDB.

16
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.100
The top result gives us full access to DynamoDB, and

17
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.040
this is the option that we'll be using.

18
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.840
This is also the place where you can limit access to DynamoDB.

19
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.640
You could set up multiple users and give certain users only read access.

20
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.380
It's always a good idea to limit the amount of access that you give out.

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.330
We will now create our group, and we'll select Next Review where we can

22
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.850
review our permissions that we have set. All looks fine,

23
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.140
so we will go ahead and create the user.

24
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.140
The Add user screen gives us the access and secret keys.

25
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.340
Once you move off the screen, you won't be able to see the secret key again.

26
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.940
You would need to create a new user and get a new access and secret key.

27
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.120
Make sure that you record these down somewhere

28
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.440
because we'll be using them shortly.

29
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.880
Back on the user's screen,

30
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.740
we can now see that our MovieRank user has been created.

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.210
This screen gives us some pretty useful information such as

32
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.630
the age of our access and password, i.e., when it was created

33
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.440
and when the key was last used.

34
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.100
Now that we have our access and secret keys,

35
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.000
we need to add them to our credentials file that our DynamoDB client will read from.
