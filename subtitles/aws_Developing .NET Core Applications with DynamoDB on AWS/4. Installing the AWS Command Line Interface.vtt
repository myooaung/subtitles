00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.370
A good way to get this all set up correctly is to download the AWS

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.390
command‑line interface. If we head along to docs.aws.amazon.com

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.600
website and we search for Install the AWS Command Line Interface on

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.480
Microsoft Windows, select the first option, this page gives us

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.830
multiple options to select to download the CLI. We can download the

6
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.840
64 or 32‑bit installer.

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.700
If you are unsure what version to download,

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.290
you can also download the generic one that will select the correct

9
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.840
version for you during installation. Once you have installed the AWS CLI,

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.300
open up command prompt and type aws ‑‑version. You should be returned a

11
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.640
version number back for the AWS CLI.

12
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.690
This ensures that your install was successful. Once we have confirmed

13
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.000
that our AWS CLI has been successfully installed, we can add our AWS

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.560
credentials to our credentials file. Remember,

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.680
these will be used by our DynamoDB client inside our application to gain

16
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.690
access to our AWS account and allow us to interact with DynamoDB. If we

17
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.820
type aws configure in command prompt, we're asked for our access ID, so

18
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.030
we'll grab our access ID that we got from our IAM role, and we'll also

19
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.140
enter our secret key.

20
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.140
The secret key that I'm typing in here is a fake secret key.

21
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.310
We're also asked for a default region name and the region

22
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.270
that we're using is us‑west‑2 Oregon, and we'll select none

23
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440
for the default output format.

24
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.640
Let's now have a look at where our credentials file was created.

25
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.020
If we open up Windows Explorer and we head along to

26
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.360
C:\Users your username, in my case,

27
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.030
it's daniel.donbavand, our folder would have been created .aws. Inside

28
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.700
this folder, we can see that a credentials file exists. If we

29
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.710
right‑click on this and select Edit, you can see our AWS access and

30
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.540
secret key that we set in our command prompt.

31
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.560
We also want to set a region here so we're going to say

32
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.240
region = us‑west‑2, and we'll save that file.

33
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.490
Now that we have our credentials setup,

34
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:43.000
our DynamoDB client will be able to access this to gain access to our AWS account and our movie ranked DynamoDB table.
