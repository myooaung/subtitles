00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:07,984
In this module, we looked at and spoke about the DynamoDB low-level model.

2
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:12,883
We implemented inside our application the following endpoints.

3
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:14,640
The get all items from our database endpoint,

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,281
we can now get a specific movie using only the first

5
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:22,164
letter or first word of the movie name.

6
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:25,527
We added the ability to get what movies a user has

7
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,813
ranked based on the movie name.

8
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:30,866
We allow our users to rank movies,

9
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:34,584
we also allow them to update an already ranked movie,

10
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:39,163
so they are able to update their ranking.

11
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:43,042
We can get an overall movie ranking, taking in all user's rankings,

12
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,359
and then providing us with the average of those rankings.

13
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:50,700
This is the first time that we were able to add the ability

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,414
to create and delete DynamoDB tables.

15
00:00:54,414 --> 00:01:04,000
In our next module, we will create an integration test framework, including tests to test our application.
