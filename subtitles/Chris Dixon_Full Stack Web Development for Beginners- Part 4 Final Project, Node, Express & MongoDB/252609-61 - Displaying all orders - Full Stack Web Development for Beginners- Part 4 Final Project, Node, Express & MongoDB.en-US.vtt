00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.325
In the last video, we created an account area where the user can see their own bookings.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.080
Puts us in admin,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.135
we want to be able to have all bookings available to see for all users.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:21.340
If we login as an admin and then go to forward slash admin,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.620
we already have this admin view available to us.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.660
Earlier when creating this page,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
we also added a menu item called view bookings,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.525
which you can now go ahead and use.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:36.735
This is over in the admin.plug file.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.825
So let's open this up, inside more views,

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.980
so click on the admin.pug, and here we go,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.740
this is the view booking section which links

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.180
to forward slash admin, forward slash orders.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.705
So now we need to go over to the index.js file and handle this route now.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:01:00.685
Let's copy this route, close it down,

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.380
I'll close more of this files down,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.560
go to the index.js and keep this organized.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.419
I'm going to go back up to the admin section.

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:15.080
So these are the admin routes and then add router.get,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.205
since this is a get request.

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:22.699
And then paste in the string of admin forward slash orders,

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:26.370
this is also going to use the user controller then we're going to

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.195
create all orders inside the user controller.

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:31.985
So you give this file a save.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:35.860
Lets head over to the user controller.js.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.575
So this all order section is going to be very

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:44.525
similar to the my account section which we created in the last video.

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:51.630
So we can copy this full section from before and then paste in just below.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.510
We need to change my accounts to be all orders.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.845
So the main difference between this and

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:07.285
the my account section is we don't need these much stage from the aggregation pipeline.

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:11.160
This is because we don't need too much to a particular user,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.010
we can simply look up all of the orders inside of our database.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.115
So we can remove this match stage from our order,

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:25.150
we also need the template to be changed to a template called orders,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.510
and we'll create this soon and the title of all orders.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.340
This is all the changes we need to make.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.535
So now we can create the orders template inside of our views,

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.740
we need to create orders dot pug.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.845
So to begin, we can extend the layouts,

00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:52.780
block contents,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.330
pass in the title as a level 3 heading, a horizontal line.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.180
So under this horizontal line,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.445
we want to display the orders.

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:09.110
Remember from the last video,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.075
we already added the code to display the orders inside of this user account.pug file.

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:18.830
So if we open up the user accounts,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.120
this is all the same code we have here to display the order.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.405
So rather than type out all this again,

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:29.530
it would make sense to add this to a mixin.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.165
Let's copy, or in fact we'll cut only information from the list item,

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:40.280
the number of guests, right up to this bookings if at the top.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.170
We cut this out over to the sidebar,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.990
inside the mixins we can create a new file,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.270
and this one is called underscore orders.pug.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.685
This mixin is created just like we always do with the name at the top, so mixin order.

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:00.800
In fact we'll call this orders,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.910
which is going to take in the individual order.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.420
Then indented in one level,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.615
we can paste in the booking from before.

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:12.839
Make sure this is all indented correctly,

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.540
otherwise we get some errors.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.985
Now we just need to add this mixin into our two files,

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.855
starting with the user account.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:25.245
We just clip this out from before.

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:28.190
At the top we can include are mixin,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.085
which is in the mixins folder,

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:34.070
and then underscore orders.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.710
Then scroll down we can now add our mixin.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.315
We want this to appear on the screen so we just stuffed our loop,

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:44.015
we can add in orders.

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:47.990
I'm going to pass in the individual order from our loop,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.520
save this file and then we can do the same for the order.pug file.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.260
So we select this,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.110
at the top we can include our mixin,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.570
so mixins forward slash _orders,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.760
then under the horizontal line we can create our loop,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.605
just like we did in the user accounts.

00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:15.025
Each order in orders,

00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:19.270
then we can add our orders mixin,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.435
which takes in the individual order from our loop.

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:27.600
Give this file a save, back to the admin.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.650
We can now click on view bookings down at the bottom,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.850
which takes us to the relative admin forward slash orders,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.870
scroll down, and now we can see two different orders from two different users.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.215
As well as being logged in as an admin and being able to see all orders,

00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:49.415
we also have our own unique accounts section at the top.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.485
Let's click on this too,

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.330
and now if we scroll down,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.040
we should see just our own honors,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.060
but we have a 404 of not found.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.740
We can see there is an issue at the top.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.105
We can link it to forward slash admin forward slash my accounts,

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:08.150
and we don't want this admin section inside here.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.715
We just need to go to my account.

00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:16.270
Let's go over to the layout of pug,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.090
we just need a forward slash before my accounts.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.805
I should try once more, clicking on my bookings,

00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:29.015
now we just have the single booking for Chris's account,

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:31.580
and again if we go to Admin,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.740
go down to View Bookings.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.840
Because we're admin we can also see other people's orders too.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.515
Along with this, this also means our mixin is also working fine too,

00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:47.245
since we're now seeing this order information in two separate files.

00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:52.130
This is it now for displaying all orders inside of the admin screen.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.870
In the next video we'll go back to our styling by adding some final CSS.
