00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.835
We now have our use model now.

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:09.420
On to creating a sign-up form to register a user.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.815
Earlier in the project if we go over to the layout.pug,

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.695
up to the top in the header section,

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:18.870
we added a sign-up link,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.580
which links to /sign-up.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.175
Now we can handle this route in the index.js file.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.560
Let's go over to here.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.710
Route, index.js.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
Close this down. If we scroll right down to the bottom,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290
so just above the module.exports,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.930
we can create a comment of user routes.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.725
First of all, we can add router.get,

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:52.455
since this is a get request,

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:57.960
we can add the route of /sign-up.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.810
Then we're going to create a userController in just a moment.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.030
Then the function name of signUpGet, semicolon at the end.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.265
We're using this userController this time rather than the hotelController,

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:17.525
which we've used so far in this course.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:20.845
This is because I'm going to be adding a userController,

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.689
to keep things organized and separated.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.745
This index.js file will also need access to the userController too.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:32.980
Therefore, we can add it at the top under our hotelController.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.000
Scroll right up, here we require

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.020
the controllers and so far we only have the hotelController,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.480
so just below we can add a constant of userController.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.025
Just like above, we can add the require, add path.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:02:01.080
This is going to be../controllers/userController,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.730
and add a semicolon at the end.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.970
Now we need to go ahead and create

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.245
this userController file inside of our controllers folder.

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:20.385
Open the sidebar, click on "Controllers" and create a New File.

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:26.410
UserController, capital C.js.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.760
The 1st thing that this file needs is access to the user model.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.105
We can require this at the top inside of a constant.

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:40.030
Constant User, capital U equals require,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.900
then add file path which is the string../ it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.150
in the models folder /user.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.640
Below this, we need to create the signUpGet to handle displaying the sign up form.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.100
So exports, this is setup just like the hotelController,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.325
the function name of signUpGet,

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:09.460
this is equal to our function which takes in the request,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.080
the response our function Bonnie.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.690
All we need to do is add a res.render to render a page template,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.320
which we want to call sign_up,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.400
possible options would be title of user sign up.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.025
Give that a save. Before we can go ahead and create this sign of template though,

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:41.305
1st I'm going to create a mixin at the Form 2.

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:43.645
So open up the sidebar,

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:46.205
Views, and then Mixins,

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:54.330
create a new file _user_ form.pug.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.485
Now we can go ahead and create our form.

00:03:59.485 --> 00:04:08.185
Let's start by creating our mixin name of userForm and then setup our form as normal.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:12.305
The action is going to be equal to an empty string,

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:15.835
so it makes a post request to the current rounds,

00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:19.420
so the method of post,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:27.260
the class, which we're going to surround each input is form_input.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.835
Indent it in one level, the label,

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:36.079
so just like earlier when we created the form to add a new hotel,

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:41.870
each one of these input types needs to match the name which we used in our schema,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.680
so the 1st one is going to be for the first name,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.510
the surname, the email, and so on.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.210
This label is going to be for the first name,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.495
so first_ name, underneath text of first name to appear an excellent form.

00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:07.250
The input, since it's text,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.320
we can add the input type of text,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.650
so type equals text.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.560
The name of first_name,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.340
the ID to match the label.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.680
Again, it's just first_name and also this field is required.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.095
If we go back and indent this at the same level as this form input,

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:44.580
we can add one more.form_input.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.270
The labels begin for surname.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.225
The text of surname with a colon,

00:05:57.225 --> 00:06:00.470
so this input is also the same as above.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.960
This is going to be the type of text,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.430
the name of surname,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.565
the ID to match, which is also surname too,

00:06:14.565 --> 00:06:18.460
and also mark this field as required.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.130
Let's copy this input from above and we can reuse this for the email.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.680
The label for email,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.020
the text of email,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.310
input type of email too,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.775
and then just change the names inside of here too,

00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:41.960
the ID, and this field is also required.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.465
Let's copy these three lines from above as well for the email and paste them in,

00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:50.090
because we're going to be reusing a similar one,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.495
but this time this going to be to confirm the email.

00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:57.000
The 2nd one is going to be confirm_email.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.930
I'm going to copy this name,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.870
so the type is fine,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.670
add this in the name, add this in the ID.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:15.010
This field is also required and then just add the text of confirm email.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.030
The next one is going to be for the password.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.240
Let's add the form_input, the label.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:34.870
This is going to be the label for the password field, the input.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.360
The input, we can add a type of password and let's makes

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.125
sure that the password is not visible when the user types this out inside the browser,

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:50.980
so the name of password 2, the ID.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.000
This field is also required.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:05.210
That looks like everything we need for the password. Now let's copy this.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.410
Actually in fact, we need to add the text of

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.490
password and then let's duplicate these three lines of code,

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.220
add this in just below,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.470
and this one is going to be for confirm password.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:25.275
Just add to confirm and then an underscore. We can copy this.

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:29.445
Change the text here to confirm password.

00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:32.175
The input type is also password too,

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:36.590
so I'll paste this in as the name and also the ID.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.195
Again, this field is also required.

00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:45.010
The last thing we need now for our form is the inputs with the type of submit.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.780
This is going to have the same form_input wrapper,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:56.400
so the button, put in type of submit,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.870
and also a class of button small.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:10.245
Finally, we can finish this off with the text of confirm. Give that a save.

00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:12.230
Now with all this in place,

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.625
we can add the sign-up template to add this mixin into,

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.855
so into the sidebar.

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:20.420
Now, to the views,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.195
we can create a new file,

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:28.240
and this is going to be called sign_up.pug.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:34.290
This file of sign_up is the one which matches inside of our userController.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.635
This is one that we created just here,

00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:40.160
so now we need to add our basic information inside here.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.415
We go to sign-up,

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.430
this extends our layout.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.565
We need to also include the mixin which we just created.

00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:58.470
Mixins folder /_user_ form, the block contents.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.579
Now onto our contents,

00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:04.305
we can add a level 2 heading,

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:06.489
which is the title,

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:09.305
a horizontal line below the title,

00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:14.540
and then under here we can add our mixin, which is userForm.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.635
Now all that's left to do is to try this out in the browser.

00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:26.310
So head over to the browser and let's go over to the sign up link inside the header,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.280
scroll down and here's our sign-up form which we created.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.755
I'm just going to change this to be a capital U, so we userController.

00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:38.340
I change it inside of here,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.910
reload, and that looks better.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.840
This is step 1 now completed.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.600
Next, we'll create the post request to handle

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.540
signing up the user once they submit this form.
