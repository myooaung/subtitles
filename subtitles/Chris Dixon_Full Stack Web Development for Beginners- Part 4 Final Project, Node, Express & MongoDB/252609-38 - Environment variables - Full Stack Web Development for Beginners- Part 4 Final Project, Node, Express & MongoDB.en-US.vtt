00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.420
In this video, we are going to be using what is called environment variables.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.280
This will basically be a separate configure file inside of our projects.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.980
Which lists all of our user account names,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.875
passwords and authentication details,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.660
all in one place.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.800
This has certain benefits.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.345
For example, it keeps our secret information in one place,

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:28.700
meaning it easier to ignore this one file when sharing

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.405
our projects all push into a service like GitHub.

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:36.415
Meaning our code is in a much safer way for security.

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:38.805
When attained up to production,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.185
many hosting providers also spots these environment variables,

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:47.090
making setting up our hosting even easier and this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.370
is something which we'll look at later when we push our app to Heroku.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.364
Also if a reuse any of these variables,

00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:57.875
such as passport formation in multiple files,

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:02.185
changing or leasing one configure file is a lot easier.

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:06.740
For this, I'm going to be using a nose package called.env.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.385
This will allow us to basically create a new file with

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:15.985
the.env extension and this will be used to store our variables inside.

00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:20.060
At the moment, the only sensitive information we have is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.680
stored inside of our app.js. Let's open this up.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.300
app.js, it's this information here,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.720
which is our database connection but we'll be adding

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.000
more sensitive information in upcoming

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.490
videos when we connect to Cloud Storage for images.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.580
First of all, we can import the package as usual inside the terminal.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.750
Down at the bottom we use a npm install,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.690
close down the server and run npm-i, then.env.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.540
Give us a moment to pull in a package from mpm.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.930
Let's just restart the server.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.675
Would npm run their stuffs?

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:09.740
So now if we open up our sidebar,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.380
we can go ahead and create the Config file,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.660
which we are going to be using to store all of our variables inside.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.860
Close this down. Then in the root of the project create in a new file,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.235
which is simply.env and make sure this is in the root alongside the app.js.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:33.480
Then we add our variables using name,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.240
value pugs and also using the capital letters too.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.945
I'm going to use DB, which is for our database,

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:47.465
and then satisfy DB variable to be equal to a database, URI.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:52.260
This is over in the app.js, open this up,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.250
then we can quote our database URI and the connection,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:06.195
take this out with the quotations and then paste this in as our DB variable.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:09.705
Behind the scenes this.env module,

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:13.070
we'll take all the variables we create inside this file

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.705
and add them to what is called the process.env objects,

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.030
which is provided with node.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.360
This object contains information about

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.245
the user environment such as our username and also the user directory.

00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:31.930
The variables were add inside this file,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.885
will also be added to this object too and this is how we access them inside of old files.

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:39.170
To understand this better,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.350
we can output this process.env objects and see what it includes.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.830
If we go to the hotelController and then go to the homepage filters, which are before.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.670
Let's do any console log and see what's included.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.930
At the top of our clients section,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.410
let's add a console log,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.270
then it's logged to the console,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.520
the process.env and then go for.USER,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.650
which is capitals..USER is one of the properties

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.240
on these objects and it contains the current uses name.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:25.235
If we save this, pull up the terminal and go to the browser,

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:27.530
go to our homepage,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.535
it reloads, then over to Visual Studio Code.

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.815
If we scroll up to the top,

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.650
we now see the username of Chrisdixon,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.860
which is stored inside this use of variable.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.310
Along with many more things which are also on this objects.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.250
We can also access the present working directory with.PWD,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.005
save this and then reload the browser of the terminal.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:05:00.065
If we scroll down after the two green lines where the server has restarted,

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:04.060
we can see the current path to the present working directory.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.900
Finally, you can also try our own DB variable which we just created.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.995
Change PWD to be DB.

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:16.880
Reload the browser, Scroll

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.945
down and we see the value of undefined down at the bottom here.

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:26.450
This is because we need to require it first inside of

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.675
our project if it work and inside of the

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:32.420
app.js is where we're going to add this so it's

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.100
available as early as possible inside of our projects.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.210
So app.js, let's go up to the very top,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:49.750
above all these variables and then require inside the brackets, the.env package.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.260
We don't need stall this inside of a constant as we don't need to

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.935
access it again inside the file but instead,

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:02.660
we said.config with the semicolon at the ends,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:10.010
which passes the contents of the env file and assigns it to the process.env objects,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.860
which we looked at before,

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.050
then we can try again to reload the browser.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.480
Save this file, reload our projects.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.090
Now we see a problem inside the browser.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.765
If we go to Visual Studio Code,

00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:30.035
we can now see some error messages inside here.

00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:33.725
This is because we now try to setup our Mongoose connection,

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:36.455
but we have a empty connection just here.

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:40.205
So instead we can now pass in our DB variable,

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:41.705
which you create it before.

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:45.710
We can add the same just like we did inside the console log with

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:54.900
process.env.DB for our variable.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.935
Save this and now if we reload the browser,

00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:04.275
this is all working again and then scroll down to the bottom of the terminal.

00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:08.090
We can now see we're all putting our database variable,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.270
which we still have in the console log just here.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.970
Now let's remove is console log as we don't need this

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.415
anymore and make sure that this is still working in the browser.

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:22.760
Good. If you still see the information from the database,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.350
such as our hotels and also the countries down at the bottom,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.180
everything is still working but by using environment variables.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.550
We will add more variables to in the next video,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.580
where we'll look at using cloud storage with Cloudinary.
