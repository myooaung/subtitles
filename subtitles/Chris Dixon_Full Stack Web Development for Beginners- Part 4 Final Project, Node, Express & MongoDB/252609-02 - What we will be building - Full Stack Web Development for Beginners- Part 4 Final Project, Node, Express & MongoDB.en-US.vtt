00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.935
In this section and for pretty much the remainder of this course,

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:07.245
we're going to build the niche travel application,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:12.495
when user can login and make bookings for hotels in various countries.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.399
This is going to be the homepage,

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.040
which is going to be the starting point where a user

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.204
can search for hotels in different countries.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:24.345
We can also add the number of nights and also the number of guests,

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.370
as well as certain filters such as the star rating,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.075
and we can also solve the hotel's price wise from low to high or high to low.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.440
Further down, we're also pulling in some random hotels from

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.330
the database and restricted needs to be the first nine.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.420
The user can click on any of these hotels and find out more information.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.425
He will get an extended view of the hotel.

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.735
We also get a description and then at the bottom,

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.330
we get the chance to then search for this hotel with

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.975
the current availability and also the current price.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:02.465
If we go back to the homepage further down at the bottom after the hotels,

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.000
we also have a list of countries where we can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.270
filter down the hotels by the various countries.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.265
If we click on each one of these,

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:14.990
we can then see each hotel which is available for that particular country.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.490
Along with these filters, we can also click on the "All Countries" and then

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.785
see a list of all available countries which we have hotels available for.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.975
Once we add new hotels as an Admin,

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:31.040
these countries are automatically updated on the front-end too.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.800
So we don't need to worry about adding all these in,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.080
each time we add a new country, as well as these countries.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.229
If we go back up to the hotels,

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.365
we also have a link to see all the available hotels.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.840
If want to scroll through all the ones which you have on

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.150
the database rather than filtering down by the countries by using a Search.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.200
Service application will be a node-based application using

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.780
the express framework which we'll learn about in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.055
this section and the forthcoming sections two.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.710
Will also be using various technologies to join this project,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.620
such as MongoDB to store our data.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.095
We use Mongoose for various things such as structuring our models or other data.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:17.540
Along with all this, will also have the facility for the user to go ahead and login.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540
We can log in with an email and password.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.340
So let's listen now.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.905
Will also be using flush messages,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:29.075
just like you see here,

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:32.930
to give the user some feedback about when a login or logout,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.240
along with the admin to be able to see when

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.885
a hotel has been successfully added to the database.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:42.440
Once we login, we now have an account section which we can click on.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.665
We can also check out the current bookings which each user has available.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:51.110
Along with this, if the user is an admin,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.330
so let's go to '"/admin".

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.300
Currently, the username and password which I've entered is down as an admin.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.795
So we now have access to this admin section of the website,

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:09.520
which is going to be the back end where can have some administrator privileges,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.550
such as adding new hotels to the database,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.830
which we can do with this form here.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.860
The admin can also edit details of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.815
a hotel or completely remove them from the database too.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:24.965
All we need to do is, add the hotel's ID,

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:27.370
or we can search by the hotel name,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.170
if we're not sure of the ID.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.250
Back to the admin, we can also view all of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.450
the available bookings which being placed by all users.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.540
Once we're logged in as a user and perform search,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.115
let's search for Jamaica, seven nights,

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:49.300
and we can add a date,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.670
number of guests, the star rating,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.620
and also the price filters.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.535
We can click on "Search" and then we've taken it to the search results.

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:03.500
So this is the hotel which matches our filters and we'll also have a section on

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.495
the right-hand side which calculates

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:10.270
the total per person and as well as the total cost of the booking.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.810
We can then continue through to the confirmation screen which

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.065
provides the full description of the hotel along with the facility to place an order.

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:25.025
Once it is placed on and taken to our counts and then we can see down at the bottom that

00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:29.975
our order has been added down at the bottom with a unique order reference.

00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:31.715
If you go to the admin,

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.530
it should also be added inside here

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.190
too because we're logged in as an admin too for this current user.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.564
We can also go to View bookings,

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:45.170
and then see the bookings placed down at the bottom too.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.280
If we're to go ahead and log out and then try this admin section.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.670
We can see we're redirected back to the homepage because this route is protected.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.845
So during this project, we're going to be learning a variety of things.

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:05.420
As I mentioned before, we'll be using node for the back end,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.010
express as the framework to build this project,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.495
Mongoose and MongoDB for our back-end data,

00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:16.670
route into navigate through our projects along with

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.045
the MVC pattern which will allow us to add some structure to our project too.

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:25.220
Along with this will learn so much more including authentication,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.235
how to keep users logged in using sessions,

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:29.580
along with so much more,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.115
and we'll find out all about this in the upcoming sections.

00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:36.380
So we're going to kick off this project in the next video,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.210
where we'll take a look at node and MPM along with installing this on our system.
