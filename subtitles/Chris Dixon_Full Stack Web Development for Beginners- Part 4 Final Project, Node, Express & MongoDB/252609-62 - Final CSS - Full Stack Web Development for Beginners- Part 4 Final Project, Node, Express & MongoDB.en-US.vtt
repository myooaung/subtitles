00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.070
It's been a little while since we worked with our styling.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.160
So let's take a few moments to make some adjustments,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.435
particularly to the features we've added in the last few sections.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.875
I'm not going to add a great deal of extra CSS.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:23.280
You can go even further if you want to Now what's make a few small changes,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.115
starting with the buttons.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:30.489
So you probably already noticed if we go to a hotel,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.905
and then if we do a search for the date,

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:43.430
number of guests, once we've taken through to the results page,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.655
we have this button just here for continue.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:50.555
We also have a button for placing the order.

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:54.845
So the first thing I'm going to start with is these buttons on here.

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:58.315
So let's go over to the style.css.

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:02.035
So we'll go over to the public folder,

00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:04.830
which close on these down.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.270
So the public folder.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.585
Then we need to go into the style sheets and then the style.css.

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:16.835
So inside of this file and also outside of the media query,

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:19.675
we can add our button styling,

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:26.295
so let's scroll down to our media query, which is just here.

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.935
We can make sure we're outside of this.

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.070
So just under button small,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.995
I'm going to add the button class,

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.455
which is inside of our HTML.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:39.700
We can add a background color.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.390
I want to set minds be cadet blue,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.540
and a small border-radius, all five pixels.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.855
Also a little padding of 0.5em. Save this.

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:04.740
Reload. Now our button looks a lot nicer.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.045
If we now go over to the account page by clicking a link at the top.

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:13.640
These bookings list, which you've added in the last few videos,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.880
also need some work too.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.405
This was inside of the oldest mixins orders.pug file.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:24.540
This has a mixins called _orders.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.845
So let's go to the mixins and open this file up.

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:32.150
This mixin was surrounded with a div with the class of bookings,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.549
which we can now use in the CSS.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.985
Sparkle to the style.css.

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:46.160
Let's again, add these outside of the media query so target the bookings ul.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.384
I'm going to add some margin of 2em,

00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:51.720
the top and bottom,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.300
and zero to the left and right.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.905
The backgrounds, again of cadet blue.

00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:03.580
Also a small padding value of 10 pixels.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.225
So let's save this.

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:09.075
Reload my account section.

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.540
So next of all, we want to target

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.010
the individual list items and set these up to be block-level,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.655
so they're stacked on top of each other.

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:21.510
So after the bookings ul.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.325
Let's add bookings li.

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:29.980
Set the display type to be block.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.110
The background, so this stands out from the cadet blue.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:47.805
I'm going to add a gray value of eee and also some padding of 0.5em.

00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:51.760
Let's see how this looks in the browser.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.855
Add an s. There we go.

00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:04.205
So I'm not going to go too deep into this styling as lot is down to personal preference.

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:07.945
But the last thing I'm going to change is the flash messages.

00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:12.005
These are located in side of the layout.pug file.

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:18.175
So let's head over there and scroll down to our message section, which is just here.

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:22.160
We see a class of message being applied to the div,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.130
which will hold our general message styling.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.260
Then also a dynamic class of message underscore.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.395
This will either be info, success or error.

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.020
Using these class names,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.020
we can create different colors to each message type.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.695
For example, red for an error.

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:47.015
Also below this there is a span with the class of close button.

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:49.670
This can also be used to style the cross,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.715
which removes the message.

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:54.570
So onto the styling.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.390
So we again, outside of the media query,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.480
let's start with the.message.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.970
This was for our general message styles.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.045
So some margin of ten pixels on the top and bottom,

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:14.760
zero on the left and right a small padding value of 0.5em,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.395
a border of one pixel,

00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:21.910
and a solid line,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.380
a border-radius of five pixels.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.710
Also the font size to be 1.2em.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.505
Save this. Let's try looking out.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.555
So this now looks a little bit better.

00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:46.745
Let's now target the cross to just here and move it over to the right-hand side,

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:51.780
as well as changing the cursor to be a pointer. We will hover over.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.970
So underneath the message,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.290
we can target the close_btn.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.260
We can float this to the right.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.000
So now we can also target the close button.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.595
But this time the hover states.

00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:15.990
All I want to do here is change the cursor to be a pointer.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.170
So the next three styles which we are going to add

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.650
are all going to be related to the message type.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.125
So remember from before inside the layouts,

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:30.005
we have this dynamic section of message_.

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:34.405
So [inaudible] _info, success and error.

00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:37.755
So we can use these to divide three different colors,

00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:39.675
follow the flash messages.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:44.530
So let's start with the message_info.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.680
The message_success.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.350
Then the last one is message_error.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.860
So all we're going to do here is add some colors.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.894
So the first one, I'm going to add an RGB value of 40,

00:07:05.894 --> 00:07:11.320
92 and for the blue a value of 177,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:20.535
for the success, the value of 39, 87 and 39.

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:23.365
Then for the error message,

00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:32.380
the red color is going to be an RGB value of 233, 66 and 66.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.455
Let's add a semicolon at the end of these three lines.

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:40.785
Save this file, then reload the browser.

00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:44.210
So first of all, if we try to log out,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.635
we get a blue message for info.

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:50.485
Let's try logging in.

00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:56.305
So first of all, if we do a incorrect password on login,

00:07:56.305 --> 00:07:58.965
we get the red error message.

00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:04.290
So let's try again with the correct password this time.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.664
Now we get the green color for success.

00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:10.295
Excellent. This is now working well.

00:08:10.295 --> 00:08:13.280
I'm going to leave it here for the CSS styling.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.090
But of course, go ahead and change things to suit your needs.
