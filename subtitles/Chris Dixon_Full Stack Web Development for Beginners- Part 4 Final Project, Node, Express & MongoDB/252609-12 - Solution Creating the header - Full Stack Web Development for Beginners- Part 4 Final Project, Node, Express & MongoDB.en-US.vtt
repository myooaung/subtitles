00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.280
I hope you managed to give that a go and hopefully have some header content.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.500
Now on the screen, I'm going to go ahead and create my version of this header.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.330
If yours is different to mine,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.180
you can either change it to be the same as ones created in

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.485
this video or keep yours as you would like. Either way is fine.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.570
I would maybe recommend though keeping

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.630
the same class names as we use in this video so the CSS matches up later.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.695
Let's begin over any layout docktype file.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.595
In between the body section and the block content.

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm going to begin by creating

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
the header section just like we would normally do with HTML.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.345
Nested inside within this nav element.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.060
This logo can be a link.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.990
This is so the user can click on it and then be taken back to the index page.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.260
Our a for our link,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.535
which can include the href inside of the brackets which simply links to forward slash,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:03.565
which is the homepage.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:06.505
Then one level in from our link.

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.690
If we go ahead and add our image,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.590
this will then be clickable and also link to this homepage which is forward slash.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.250
Inside of the brackets we add our source,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.660
so SRC and the sequence be forward slash images.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.690
This is logo.png.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.940
We can add a class or an ID to our element.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.460
By adding this inside the brackets as

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
a attributes or we can add it just after the element name.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.275
Add image and the harsh and logo.

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:47.310
This will give the ID of logo for this image.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.100
Then just after this we can go ahead and create

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.975
our another list which is going to be for our sign up and login links.

00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:59.720
This needs to be at the same level as our surrounding link above,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.320
so ul followed by our list items.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080
If we want to make these links,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.820
we need to indent the a tag plus the href.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.690
We don't have these templates or these routes setup just

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.785
yet but we can still go ahead and link these to sign up.

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.960
With a text of sign up to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.660
and then do the same below add our next list item at the same level as the one above.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.540
Turn this into a link.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.340
This time this one is going to be for login,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.645
which is the routes of forward slash login and the text of login to.

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:49.675
If you've created this and you've not added the href in,

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:52.070
I would recommend you keep yours consistent with

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.280
mine so it has no problems further down the line.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.770
I added forward slash login and also forward slash sign-up.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.360
That give us save name over to the browser.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.370
There's a logo and then our two links at the top too.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.360
The next thing to do is to create our form input for our search.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.395
Which is where we can type in the destination, the duration,

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:23.560
the departure dates and also the number of guests that we want to search for,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.005
so we do this just with a simple HTML form.

00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.770
This form is going to be in a surrounding div.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.600
This div needs to be on the same level as our nav element.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.340
Come down for the nav element and then begin this at the same level.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.665
When creating a div with the class,

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:48.020
we can even create the element just like this and then add the class name as

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.830
a attribute or instead we can have a shorthand

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.370
which is simply dot and the name of our class.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.040
If we wanted a div with the class of search nav,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.915
we would just do it simply like this.

00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:07.995
This will then be outputted as a div with this class.

00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:10.680
Then inside we can nest our form.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.130
This form is going to be made up of a series of form input and each one is

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.740
going to have a surrounding div of input underscore wrapper.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.075
This will make each input block level,

00:04:24.075 --> 00:04:26.475
so they appear on their own line.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:31.080
Then we need to label for our first one which is going to be destination.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:39.880
We add the for attribute or destination and then a text of destination.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.620
Then we can add our input,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.580
the type of text,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.970
the idea of destination which will match this label just here.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.100
The name of destination too.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.445
I will just change the style so it's a little bit more readable

00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:12.585
and then the required attribute on the very end.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:14.640
Save this and then let's see how it's looking in

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.365
the browser and now we have our destination form input.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:22.245
Now this is working, we can go ahead and copy

00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:25.290
this input_wrapper and then

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.030
paste this in and make sure this is at the same level as above.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.120
This one is going to be for the duration.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.170
Change the label to duration,

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.130
the text and then we can

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.665
add nights inside here because we're going to be sign the duration per night.

00:05:43.665 --> 00:05:46.245
The input type of text is fine,

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:52.600
the ID needs to match alteration and the name of duration too.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.680
This field is also required so we can leave this in too.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.140
The next one is going to be for the departure date

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:10.360
so the label text.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.520
This time the input is going to have the type of date so it drops down as a date picker.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:30.015
The ID of departure date too and then the name, date of departure.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.590
This is going to be CamelCase.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.875
This field is also required just like the others.

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:44.660
I'll do this the same one more time this one is going to be a number field.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.110
The input type of number because this is going to be for

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.440
the number of guests, so number-guests.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.980
The name of number of guests and

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:06.105
then the ID which must match this label of number guests.

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:09.390
I have a typo though so change that.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.430
Then finally the name,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.660
again in CamelCase of number of guests.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.185
Let's check this out in the browser.

00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:24.525
Great, that's our four inputs.

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:26.325
We can see if we click on the date,

00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:29.115
we now have a drop-down date picker.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:35.190
It should be a input type number which is on our two text fields at the top.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.530
Back to our layout,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.190
after these first four input we're now going to change this up.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.560
We need a couple more and one is going to be for the star rating.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.290
This is going to be a select input with different options through from one to five.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.950
We are then going to have an input with a select again,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.650
which is going to be for sorting the price from low to high or high to low.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.040
Then finally the Submit button at

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.140
the end is going to use the same input wrapper, so.input_wrapper.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:17.060
This is a select with a name equal to stars.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.110
Remember from earlier the select input do need to have an option to select.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:31.665
Add our first option inside here with a value to then pass to the server once selected.

00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:39.420
It's just going to be simply a number for the number stars and the text of min one star.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.160
We can go ahead and copy this in and paste in four more times.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.350
The second one is for two-star,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:54.420
3, 4 and 5 and also the same for the text too.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.830
The last input, again these ones have

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.280
the same input_wrapper so we keep the styling consistent.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.685
This will also be a select and this is for

00:09:06.685 --> 00:09:10.585
the price sorting from low to high or high to low.

00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:15.140
We can add the name of the select to be sort.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.980
Paste in the option with a value of one.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:28.785
This is going to for the price set from low to high.

00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:32.340
We're also going to paste in the same but this

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.705
time option can have a value of negative one.

00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:39.590
This is because these are the values which you required when searching

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:45.920
Mongo database to then sort the return queries from high to low or low to high.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.055
We'll see this in more detail later on.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:51.510
This can be also change.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.630
This time let's see price from high to low.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:03.910
The last input also needs the input wrapper and this is the Submit button.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.565
Button with the type of

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:17.670
submit and then the text of search.That should lead us now to form.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.980
Let's check for any errors.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.010
The star rating from one through to five.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.235
We have the price from low to high and high to low.

00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:29.980
Then I will submit button at the bottom.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.370
We also want this beach image be part of the header too.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.670
Inside this header section,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.680
just after the form,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.800
we need to make sure this image is indented at the same level as our navigation.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.470
If we scroll up and then go to

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:54.760
our search nav and keep an eye on this line which we see in the text editor.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.245
Now we could start our image, so img.

00:10:58.245 --> 00:11:00.230
The source just as before,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.250
is going to be equal to forward slash images which is

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:09.705
inside the public folder, the beach d.JPEG.

00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:13.720
Then let's bring up the block contents.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.415
Save and then reload the browser.

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:21.085
Now, we have the image inside the header.

00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:24.440
We also have some cleanup work to do just

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.000
below and this is only consent from the index.pugfile.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.215
Go over to index.pug.

00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:36.410
Then we can remove our examples from earlier.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.070
We can move out another list,

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.255
our links and array.

00:11:42.255 --> 00:11:44.235
We don't need the image.

00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:46.664
We don't need the text or the title.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:50.195
Let's just leave in place the extends layouts and

00:11:50.195 --> 00:11:54.115
the block contents and off to the browser.

00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:59.040
Now, we just have the header content from our layout file. There we go.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.515
There is our header content now in place.

00:12:01.515 --> 00:12:04.805
Next we'll move on looking at using mix-ins,

00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:09.990
which are a great way to reuse the same code in multiple templates.
