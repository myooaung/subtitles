00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.925
As we progress through the following project,

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:07.600
we use a hosted database on a service called mLab.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.285
MLab is a fully managed Cloud database service which we use to host our Mongo database.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.690
As we can see on the homepage here,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.990
mLab has since being acquired by Mongo itself.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.420
So we now need to use this service in its place.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.970
The service is called Mongo Atlas and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.950
it's a pretty straightforward swap since we just set

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.860
up a database in a similar way and then use

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.425
the connection string provided in our projects.

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:43.150
Mongo Atlas is also free to sign up for and it has a free tier for development too.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.870
So let's start by going over to mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.830
If you've used Atlas before and already have an account,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.040
you can go ahead and login.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.615
If not, you'll need to register first before we can create our first database cluster.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.705
So if you need to go ahead and sign up,

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:09.690
but I'm going to go down and login to Atlas now.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.545
Then once you're all setup and registered,

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:25.130
we need to go ahead and create a new cluster.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.185
Create a new cluster may pop up as part of the registration process.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:34.070
So let's go ahead and build a new cluster which is

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.300
going to allow us to select our region or our plan.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.870
There is some pre-configured options and you can leave

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.190
the defaults as they are or change to your closest region.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.685
So I'm going to select the closest regions me.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:54.470
Also keep an eye out for the free tier label, which isn't in each one.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.365
Everything else, I'm going to keep us default.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:02:01.700
Just make sure you see the cost down at the bottom to be free.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.360
Then we can go ahead and create our cluster by clicking on the green button.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.320
A new cluster can take a few minutes to get set up.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.770
So I'm going to go away now and come back as soon as this is all done.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.520
So this is my cluster all now setup and the next step is to create a new user.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.935
If we go to the security tab and then go to add new user,

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.730
this user is going to be for ourselves.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180
So we can select the atlas Admin,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.075
which is one of the options on the privileges.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.445
You can of course add more users with

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:44.365
different permissions at a later date if you need to.

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:48.590
Then add a username and password of your choice.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:58.620
I'm going to add a username and a password and then go ahead and add our user.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.305
The next step is to add our own computers' IP address to Mongo's whitelist.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:06.830
This is a security feature so only

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.840
our machine is granted permission to access our cluster.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000
You may need to bear this in mind at a later stage

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.420
when deploying the application to other services.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.355
So let's go on to the Security tab and click on 'IP whitelist'.

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:24.970
Add IP address.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.160
We get a pop-up and we can confirm that we want to use

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.415
our current IP address by clicking this button here.

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:34.655
Then we'll get the IP address added and this field follows.

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:37.500
So we can just go ahead and confirm.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.700
You may need to give this a few moments to get

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.120
setup if you see this pending spinner just here.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.595
If you've not used Mongo Atlas before,

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:51.815
we can check the contents of our database by clicking on the collections button.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:57.895
The collections button is in the overview tab and then collections.

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:01.490
This gives us access to all of the collections which

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.075
our database has and we can interact with our data.

00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:08.345
Add new fields, add new collections and

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:12.070
see all the information which is stored in our database.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.825
Of course, we don't have any data just yet,

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:18.260
but this is where you can access all of our database information,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.900
such as any hotels and users,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.545
which we'll go ahead and save from our project.

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:26.460
Finally, we need a connection string.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.425
If we go to overview and then click on 'Connect'.

00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:36.260
The option we want to use is connect your application.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.800
There is also options here to use MongoDB Compass and also connect with the Mongo Shell.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.445
Both connect your application is the one we need for now.

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:51.185
We also need to change the driver version to be version two.

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:54.020
Then we see our connection string is displayed just

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.305
here and we can also copy this to the clipboard.

00:04:57.305 --> 00:05:00.140
This connection string is the one which we'll use in

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.060
our project in place of the one provided by mLab.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.305
This is done for this update.

00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:09.980
Just keep this open in the browser and you can use it in

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.970
the next video when we connect to our database.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.645
Also just bear in mind as you go through the course,

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:18.980
you will need to go through these Mongo Atlas surveys to see

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.230
your data rather than mLab as I occasionally do in the class.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.790
All you need to do to see this is click on the collections button us we looked at before.
