00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.665
When we have repeated code in multiple templates,

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:07.935
it's often best to put this into a separate mixing,

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:11.510
and this is what we'll be doing now with our country's list.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.335
In both the index.pug.

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:18.585
Down at the bottom we have a list item which I'll puts our country.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.810
Also in the all countries.put templates,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.625
will have the same list item,

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.075
displaying our link and our country image.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:29.760
In both these templates, we'll loop through

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.275
these countries and display both the image and the name as a list.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:36.659
We already know how to use mixins.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.240
Let's go ahead and create a new file in

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.835
the mixins folder to display these countries lists.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.000
Open up the sidebar.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.475
Inside of the mixins folder,

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:49.560
let's create a new file.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.580
Underscore country, underscore list with the.pug extension.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.500
Let's give this mixin a name.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.400
So mixin country list is mixing moving past a country to output.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.735
So we can also add this variable into.

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:16.050
Then save this file.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.705
Then over in the all countries.pug file,

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.430
we can cut out the list item,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.650
the link, and also the image.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.620
Grab these three lines just here code this

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.415
out and then we can go ahead and add these to our country mixing,

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:38.460
paste these in, and makes sure the indentation is correct.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.370
We will move the list item too,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.285
so it's not at the real level.

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:46.120
So this is our mixing now looking fine.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.045
We can save this, and then go back over to the all

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:54.655
countries.pug and then up at the top we can include the mixin file.

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.830
After the extends layouts,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.950
include the mixins, forward slash and then underscore the country underscore list.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.765
Remember you don't need the pug extension.

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:11.440
Then we can add the mixing in by its name in place of the list item,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.180
which we put out indented in one level.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.830
Inside of our loop, we call this the country list.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.730
This country list is also going to take in the country,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.335
which is passed from our controller.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:30.500
We can now save this file and then go off to all countries,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.290
which we're currently on now. Reload this.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.715
We see the countries are now in place,

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.800
but this time being pulled in from a mixin.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.575
Now all we need to do is repeat this for the index.pug which is this file just here.

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:50.095
First of all, we can include the second mixin.

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:52.910
So include mixins/.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.480
We also have the hotel mixin,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.240
but this time it's the country underscore list.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.580
Then we can go down and add this mixing in place of our list item.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.830
First of all, remember in this file we access the country name with

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.595
the underscore ID and the link and also the image.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:20.710
This is because inside of our hotel controller.js,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.530
if go to the homepage filters,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.220
we group together the distinctive countries with this group in

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.865
stage with the key of underscore ID.

00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:35.175
Mainly, we'll process ID into the mixin for it to work.

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:39.205
So let's remove the free lines from the very bottom.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:44.080
We can replace this without mixing of country list,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.680
and we also put in our country._ID.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.420
If you save, now this is for the homepage.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.179
Go to the index and then scroll down below the hotels,

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.890
we now have our full country list on the homepage too,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.305
as well as the all countries list.

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:11.640
Meaning our mixing is now working and we've reduced our duplicate code.
