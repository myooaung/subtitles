00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.695
If we make our project the full-width inside the browser,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:10.890
it now looks a little stretched because so far we have focused on the small screen sizes.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.900
Let's now add some CSS inside of a media query to fix this.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
Up to our style.css,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.880
right at the very bottom of the file,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.300
we add the media query with a media.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.155
I want to be targeting the minimum browser width of 1,000 pixels.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.705
Open up the code races.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:37.385
You can have a play around with what size works best for you,

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:40.130
but I'm going to go for a 1,000 pixel

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.680
breakpoints and then begin at the top with the navigation.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.595
Select the nav elements and make sure this is inside of these media query curly braces.

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:54.360
Now we're on the largest green.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.975
Up at the top, we have the top header section set to be a flex direction of column,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:04.270
meaning the logo and also the nav links are unsalvageable.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.735
Now I'm going to change the flex direction to be back to be row,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.180
meaning the logo would be on the left-hand side,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.300
and then the links will be on the right.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:23.300
We do this with flex direction and satisfy row, reload.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.955
Inside of our navigation section,

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.305
we have the nav,

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.540
which is a link for our logo,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.155
and also have the another list for our two links here.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:37.405
I want to start the flex value for the logo to be a value of one,

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:40.365
and then the another list to be a value of two,

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:44.870
meaning it would take up twice the available space over on the right-hand side.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.210
We can then align the texts over to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.385
the right to make sure that this is over on the right-hand side of the header.

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:55.360
Let's begin with the nav a.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:04.325
If it goes to the layout inside a here we have nav and then the a nest inside,

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:06.730
and this is for our image logo.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.960
Then the another list which is not the same level,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.395
so this is going to be a flux value of one,

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:14.675
and this will be the flex value of two,

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.710
making it twice the available space.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.085
Inside of our nav a,

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:23.220
this is going to take up the flex value of one.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.250
Then our nav ul will be the flex value of two.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.130
Save this and reload.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.750
We don't see too much of a difference but if we go into

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.070
the developer tools hover over our nav,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.795
we see the blue outline for the one part.

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:46.170
Then if we go to the another list,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.195
we can see this is twice the available width.

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:52.155
Back over to the styling.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:58.250
After the flex, we can add the text alignment to be on the right-hand side,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.415
pushing over to the edge of the div.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.460
But this is probably a little too close to the edge,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:13.005
so a little margin right will fix this of one m. Reload.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.560
Now we'll have a nav bar more suited to a larger screen.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.785
Good. Now moving down to the search form below.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:24.305
Now we have many columns setup like this is better for the mobile view.

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.240
On the largest screen like this,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.660
we want to change the flex direction once again to be row,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.115
so it's more suited to the more available space.

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.430
Under our nav ul,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.910
let's target the search on the score nav.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.095
If we go to the layout.pug and then down to form,

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:46.370
this is the outer wrapper for the whole of the form.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.170
After style.css open up the curly braces and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.990
then we can set the flex direction to once again be row.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.500
There is no change.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.875
In fact, we just needs to also target the form inside here and try this, and there we go.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:11.895
Let's continue with this flex styling.

00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:16.980
Justify the content to be in the center.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.800
This will give us equal spacing on the left and right-hand side.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.260
Then after this, the flex wrap,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.985
we're going to set this to a value of wrap so it can flow onto additional lines.

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:36.810
Then finally, we'll align the items to be flex end.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.215
This will align all inputs vertically.

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:45.710
Now if we save this one I'll push these inputs to be now in line with the rest of these.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.530
This gives us the horizontal form which we want,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.885
but it's still a little squashed up.

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:55.445
Only when creating this form which surrounded each input with a div,

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.700
with the class of input Rapa.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.615
If we go over to our layout of pug,

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:02.235
inside of our form,

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.060
we can see this just here.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.605
This is round and each one of our label and input groups.

00:05:08.605 --> 00:05:11.930
Over to the style.css and again,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.000
still inside this media query,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.860
we can now target these classes which was dot input_wrapper.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.775
Let's set the margin to be zero to remove any defaults.

00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:31.830
The Padian to be 0.5ems.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.330
Save this and then reload. There we go.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.670
We can now see the pattern has added some space in between each one of these inputs.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.795
Also restrict these to be a maximum weight of a 170 pixels so don't stretch too far.

00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:53.345
Then also set the text alignment to be back to the left.

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.910
Wait for reload and now we'll have

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.255
some additional spacing around each one of these inputs.

00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:02.720
Scrolling down to the hotels and countries,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.270
the text for the headings which you see here and also for the hotels,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.620
it's still inheriting the center alignments in the mobile view.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.340
I wanted is by targeting the outer wrapper div.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.785
Remember earlier we said the outer wrapper savvy.outer wrapper class.

00:06:21.785 --> 00:06:24.785
If we scroll up this was one just here

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:28.525
which wraps all the hotels and countries on the homepage.

00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:32.030
Scroll down, we can override the text alignments

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.840
inside the media query dot outer_wrapper,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.830
we can reinstate the text alignment to be on left.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.605
Refresh. Now onto each individual hotel.

00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:52.505
I'm going to be using the flex box for each one of these hotels.

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:55.985
Let's set the display type over in the CSS.

00:06:55.985 --> 00:07:00.340
After outer wrapper, select the dot hotel,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.295
which is the div, which is surrounding each hotel in the mixin.

00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:07.420
The display type of flex.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.350
Then reload. This is how our hotels now look by default.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.570
It still needs a little work to look good though.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.255
If we go over to our hotel mixin,

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:22.060
which is underscore hotel.pug.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.695
Make this a little bit larger.

00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:27.820
We added classes to both the image section,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.475
which is hotel image just here,

00:07:30.475 --> 00:07:33.250
and also for the inflow section.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:39.305
We can now use these in the CSS to make our hotel's look a lot nicer.

00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:42.540
Back to the style.css.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.845
Let's first go for the hotel img.

00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:50.165
Give us a flex value of one,

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:57.720
and also some margin of one m to give some spacing. Save and reload.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.555
We can just about see the margin on the outside of the image.

00:08:01.555 --> 00:08:03.775
Now onto to the hotel info,

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.680
which is the text on the right-hand side.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.310
So.hotel_info.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.890
We can also give us a flex value of one to make this equal to the image.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.735
Then some patterns, add some spacing zero on the top and bottom.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:25.580
Then one m on the left hand right.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.720
Save this and then reload.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.860
Go to homepage now looks much better.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.300
However, if we click on a hotel and go up to the hotel view and scroll down.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.930
The CSS we added also applies to this full hotel detail too.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.540
I only want this image and hotel to be side-by-side.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.605
When we list all the hotels on the homepage and also in the all hotels view.

00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:57.080
First we can restrict the CSS to only apply to

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.300
the all hotels view over in the all hotels.pug.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.730
Let's take look for those templates.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.295
All hotels.pug, let's open this up.

00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:17.060
We surrounded the hotel's inside here with a.hotel wrapper.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.550
Meaning we can use this to be more specific about where we are applying our styling.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:28.670
This can be done by adding this wrapper class before the hotel class in the CSS.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.235
Go back to the style.css, let's copy this.

00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:36.945
Then just before the.hotel,

00:09:36.945 --> 00:09:39.960
let's add in the hotel wrapper,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.980
giving us a more specific CSS selector.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.860
Save this, and then it reloads.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.365
Still on the hotel detail page.

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:51.800
We've now removed the flexbox from

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.910
this view meaning we now have the content stacked on a full-size image.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.935
Let's just check over in the homepage.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:03.410
It still looks okay.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.615
Thank click on all hotels,

00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:09.295
and the flexbox skill takes effect in this view too.

00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:14.135
To finish things off, and I want to display the countries as a grid.

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:18.485
If we go over to the homepage and then scroll down to the very bottom.

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:21.080
We have the countries down at the bottom here,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.045
but the don't look too great.

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:26.090
There's two places where we display the countries.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:32.045
He on the homepage and also if you click on see all, in this link here.

00:10:32.045 --> 00:10:35.960
This is pretty much the same view as the homepage.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.565
Both of these templates have a div with the class of country wrapper.

00:10:40.565 --> 00:10:43.970
First is over in the index.pug.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.915
Open up this in the views index.

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:54.350
pug. We have contour upper down at the bottom here, surrounding our countries,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.600
and also in the all countries

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.050
templates we have the same div just here to keep things consistent.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.560
Also these countries are outputted as a another list,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.320
which we can see here.. We can use this over in the CSS.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:17.135
Back to the style.css and then down to the bottom on the hotel info.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:22.310
Let's select our country wrapper. Another list.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.280
We can set the display type to be grid.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.320
We have three columns because as the grid

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:39.210
template columns to repeat.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.420
Then inside the brackets we wants to repeat

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.510
these three times using the one fr unit to make these equal.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.760
To space them out, we can also add the grid gap,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.855
which looked at early in the course of 20 pixels.

00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:57.505
Then also align the text to be in the center.

00:11:57.505 --> 00:12:01.050
Save this and then let's check this out in the browser.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:06.335
Reloads, and this is the forward slash countries routes,

00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:10.475
which seems to have some bold text from nasa will take a look at this.

00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:14.960
Then if we go to the homepage and right down to the bottom,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.325
we also have the grid for the homepage too.

00:12:18.325 --> 00:12:21.240
Let you check out this bold text.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.175
Let's click on see all.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:26.250
We can see it's just here.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.640
Let's go over to the all countries.pug file.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.305
I think it's just a indentation problem.

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:36.600
We've got a level two heading here,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.495
and then inside of the h2 we have everything nested inside.

00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:45.020
Let's move all this over to be the same level as the h2

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.695
rather than nested inside and reload. That's a lot better.

00:12:50.695 --> 00:12:52.785
Click on a country.

00:12:52.785 --> 00:12:56.210
Then we're taken it to the country's view where we see

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.195
our two available Dominican Republic hotels inside of our list.

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:05.915
Once again, we can see how easy is to use the CSS grid.

00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:10.835
We have nicely aligned a grid layout with just a few lines of code.

00:13:10.835 --> 00:13:16.255
We'll come back to the CSS later on and add a few more changes as we go.

00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:20.405
One thing you may have noticed here is when dealing with the countries on

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:25.180
the index page and also in the all countries templates,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.260
if we'll go over to our template here,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.980
we're reusing the same code flow to different templates.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:37.080
We'll fix this in the next video by moving our countries into a reusable mixin.
