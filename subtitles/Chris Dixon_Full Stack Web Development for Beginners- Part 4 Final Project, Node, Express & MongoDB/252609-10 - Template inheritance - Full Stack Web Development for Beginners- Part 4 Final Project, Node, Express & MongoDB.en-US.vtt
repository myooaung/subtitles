00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.555
We have both block and extends keywords,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:06.555
inside the pug files at the top just here.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:09.735
If we open up our layout to pug file,

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.435
which is available in the view section,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.890
click on layout the pug.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.025
This layout file has no extends keyword at the top.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.300
This is because it acts as the main pug templates.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.825
The files will then extend this main layout.

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:33.480
This is why we can open up our index the pug and also our error the pug as well,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.640
which is available in the same folder,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.010
and then see the extends layout at the top.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.570
If we go back to the layout the pug file.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.325
There is also a block contents section here down at the bottom.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:47.930
This is what it sounds like.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.525
It's basically a block of code.

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.675
Any of the files such as our index the pug

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:57.580
can go ahead and replace this section called content.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.615
Inside of our index the pug file, we'll open this up.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:06.135
All this section here,

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:11.434
basically everything from our unordered list all the way up to our title,

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:17.860
will replaced inside of the block or inside the space which we specify inside the layout.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.840
We can also have multiple blocks too,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.370
each with a different name,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.130
such as footer or a sidebar block.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.695
These can also be added to another file,

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:29.735
and then referenced by the block name,

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:32.345
and the same way as his content section.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:36.320
We freeze, then add anything else around this block.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.880
For example, above the contents and we can add some text.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.730
Above the contents, and then below it,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.955
below the content, and now if we go to the main index page,

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:58.615
and then reload, we see at the very top we have the text of above the contents.

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:02.120
and then at the bottom we have the text of below the contents,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.205
and then everything in the middle,

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.620
right through from the title down to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.510
all unordered list isn't provided by this block content section,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.630
which is an overridden by the contents of our index the pug.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.860
Once you understand that,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.090
we can now create sections of our code inside of a layout,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.585
and then we can outsource the contents to a separate file,

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.985
skip all code, more organized,

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:35.600
more maintainable, and we can also reuse these sections of content too in multiple files.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.500
Now let's go to the layouts, and delete these two p elements which

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.590
we created, and then give that save.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.670
This layout is useful for anything we want to display in all of our pages on our site,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.640
such as adding a header and footer.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.280
We can then replace the main content down here or a new sections by adding more blocks.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.305
Now we know how our templates are laid out.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:08.700
Next, you will get the chance to get some practice by creating the header section.
