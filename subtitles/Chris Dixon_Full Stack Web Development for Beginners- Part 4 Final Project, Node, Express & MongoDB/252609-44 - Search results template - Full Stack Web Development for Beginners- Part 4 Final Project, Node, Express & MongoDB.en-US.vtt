X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.335
Now we have the correct JSON data,

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:06.494
now return back from the database.

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:11.250
We need to now create a template to display this data to the user.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.740
First if we go over to our text editor,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.630
we can create a new page template called search_results.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.655
So open up the Sidebar,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.160
and then go down to our Views,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.500
New file, so this is the search_results.pug.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:39.170
Then we can replace the res.json from the controller to render out this page template.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.725
So let's go to our controller,

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.235
which is hotel controller.js,

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:50.180
go to the search results function and rather than having this res.json,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.660
let's comment this out, double res.render.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.570
We can render out our new page templates of search results,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.840
comma, and then personal options object with the title of search results.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.430
Let's add a semicolon at the end there.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.075
Then we need to pass to the template two things.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.490
First is the search query,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.560
which contains our departure date and also the number of nights.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.040
This is stored inside the req.body,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.450
which is the data sent from the form.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.385
So add a comma; and then add our search query;

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:34.470
and then add a comma,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340
and then we can also add our search data,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.955
which is the data from the database after our aggregation filters you see here.

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:46.115
Now we can go over to our search results template.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:47.630
So save this file,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.375
go to the search_results.pug.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.720
This is going to extend layouts.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.605
We can include our mixins.

00:01:56.605 --> 00:02:01.560
So mixins/_hotel, because we'll be

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.280
reusing this mixin to display all the hotels as a list of our search results.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.770
After this we'll add our block contents,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.990
our h2 for the title,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.700
and then we need to loop through each one of the hotels in this search data,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.740
which is being passed to us.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.110
So we'll do a loop where each call this individual hotel, the hotel.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.585
So in search data,

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:38.875
we can add a hotel_wrapper or the CSS,

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:42.770
add all mixin, so plus hotel.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.935
First of all, we're going to pass to the hotel.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:48.185
Of course we need to pass the hotel data,

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:53.695
which is this one just here but we can also pass in the full search query too.

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:58.565
Remember we also send search query to this template in the controller,

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:03.545
which is just here and this is going to hold all the information from our form,

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:07.510
such as the departure dates and the number of nights.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.640
This is all information can also be included in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.580
the search results. So let's test this out.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.230
If we go over to the browser,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.540
and then let's go back and create

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.245
a new search or in fact we can just click on the search button here,

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.890
and use the existing data, and scroll down.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.730
Okay, good. So now we have our search results just

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.550
here and now instead of the JSON format,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.300
we now have our two hotels which look a lot nicer.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.845
This is good, but there are some more details to add to this hotel.

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:44.030
Before we cluster the hotel mixin the search query data,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.715
which contained the departure dates and the number of nights from the user search.

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:53.360
This is looking good, but there are some more details to add to this hotel.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.240
We want to also include over on the right-hand side

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.780
the departure dates and also the number of nights,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.910
as some additional information.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.680
So we pass this over to the hotel mixin with the search query data.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.760
Let's go over to our mixin.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.580
The search results, let's get this data from here.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.960
So now we're passing two different arguments,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.580
we need to also include this inside of our mixin.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.600
So _hotel, we can pass this in as

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.800
our second argument just up here and then

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.280
to display the search query data inside all hotel,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.315
we can do this with some conditional rendering.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.465
Let's scroll down.

00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.985
Underneath the cost per night,

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:41.595
create a new section.

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:44.165
If we indent this back one level,

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.670
so it's level with the hotel info.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.040
Create a if statements,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.150
so if url === '/results',

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.700
then we can add in the other details.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.545
Let's add a new surrounding div of the CSS,

00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:08.770
of hotel order details or with underscores.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.960
Then we could just set up some p elements, to display this data.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.910
We use the back ticks,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.285
so mix the dynamic data with the text.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:23.810
Number of nights, a colon then the

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.090
capacity in our dynamic data of searchQuery.duration.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.760
A second set of p elements,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.440
again with back ticks.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.360
This is for the departure dates,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.865
with a colon and this time this one is the search query.

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:50.610
date of departure.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.590
This is all camel case.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.995
Next up, we need to add the totals.

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:01.755
First of all, if we just save this and check this is working.

00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:05.090
If we reload the browser, resubmit the form.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.685
We now have a new div on the right-hand side,

00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:09.170
which has our data,

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.895
which had been passed to the hotel from our search form.

00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:17.225
Now we need to also add two more pieces of information.

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:20.765
The first one is the price per person,

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:22.625
and the second at the bottom,

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:27.730
we're also going to include a total cost for all of the people combined.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.150
To do this the way we'll work out the cost per person is

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.305
to multiply the number of nights by the cost per night.

00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:39.005
Then we also need to create a second calculation,

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:43.850
which is this cost per person multiplied by the number of guests.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.130
To makes this more simple,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.365
let's go over to our templates.

00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:51.020
Now we can add some JavaScript.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.570
Let's add the constant for the costEach this is going

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:04.990
to be equal searchQuery.duration.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.240
Then we've got to multiply the duration by the hotel.cost per night.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.390
So this one was cost_per_night,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.460
I'll make this small so it fits on one line.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.605
So remember, we have the duration stored in the search query,

00:07:24.605 --> 00:07:26.300
which is passing the form.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.900
But the cost per night is stored in the hotel,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.070
which we getting from this available just here.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.315
Now let's create a second constant.

00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:42.610
This is going to be for the total cost for the booking, so total cost.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.940
So this one is going to be equal to our cost per person,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.740
which is cost each and then when we need to multiply

00:07:51.740 --> 00:08:00.180
this by our searchQuery.numberOfGuests.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:08.315
Now we can use these two constants and I'll put them inside of our p elements.

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:10.340
Open up the mark ticks.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:17.790
The first one is going to be total per person and let's add a currency symbol.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.685
Then we can do our dynamic data inside of the template literals.

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:28.335
Cost each at a horizontal rule,

00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:31.310
so we can have the total cost at the very bottom,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.470
inside of a h3.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:39.360
The back ticks for the total cost again,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.400
the currency symbol then our dynamic data,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.800
which is the variable of total cost.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.685
Give that the save and then let's try this out,

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:56.490
we resubmit the form. Okay, good.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.985
We've got the number of nights, the departure dates,

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:01.039
the total for one person,

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:05.810
and then the total cost which is this multiplied by the number of guests.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.620
Let's just double-check, if we go back here we had

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.805
two different guest says the total is twice the cost per person.

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:17.420
We've also sorted the price from high to low.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:23.050
Let's search again. We have a higher price here then we see at the bottom.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.270
Let's go back and change this to be low to high.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.450
We can also change the guest before,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.460
and also change this.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.775
Click on "Search", go down to the bottom.

00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:45.545
Okay, great. Now all our details have been updated.

00:09:45.545 --> 00:09:47.225
We have a new total cost,

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:49.325
which is multiplied by four.

00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:54.505
We have a new number of nights and also the price is now from low to high.

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:57.400
If we go over to the homepage,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.100
click on the "Logo" scroll down to all hotels.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.490
We don't see any of these hotel detail on

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.890
the right-hand side because of this conditional rendering.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.150
Let's try to see all,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.795
we still don't see anything in here.

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:15.150
This is all looking good now.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:20.060
Remember we surrounded this new section inside of a div,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.610
called hotel order details.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.295
Let's copy this, and then we can style this inside of the CSS.

00:10:27.295 --> 00:10:32.240
Let's go over to the sidebar in the Public folder,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.600
Style sheets; and then the Style.css.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.085
Then scroll down to the bottom,

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:42.545
outside of a media query.

00:10:42.545 --> 00:10:45.380
Let's work with the small screen first,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.515
base in the hotel order details.

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:51.725
Let's begin by adding a background color.

00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:54.635
Keep div a little bit separate from the rest.

00:10:54.635 --> 00:10:57.760
Once you use a hex value of eed,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.720
set the text aling on the mobile view to be in the center.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.720
Then a little padding keep it away from the edge of 1em.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.290
Now we save this, and then it reload the browser on the smaller screen,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.670
add a search query.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.430
Any detail is fine.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.945
Let's search. Now scroll down.

00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:31.505
We now see the search results for this particular country.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:35.365
This is the new div which added with the different background color.

00:11:35.365 --> 00:11:40.700
We can see the text is centered on this new div but it's not centered

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.495
on the hotel info section above on this particular folds/results page.

00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:49.410
Let's go ahead and fix this now.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.460
Again, outside of the media query,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.220
this is the hotel info section.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.110
Scroll up, so let's add the text line to be sensor.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:07.020
Gives us a reload, and there we go so that looks much better.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.230
Let's just quickly check this doesn't mess up any of the areas of our sites.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.250
If we go to the homepage and also on See All,

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.270
we'll need to reinstate this in the media query.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.790
Let's just copy this hotel info section,

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:28.875
scroll down to the media query, and here we go.

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:33.445
In fact, we can just change the text line to be back to the left,

00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:38.270
reload and this is looking much better now.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.465
Back to our search query you can add a couple more styles for the larger view.

00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:52.725
Let's add the same search query, click "Search".

00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:54.405
Now on the larger screen,

00:12:54.405 --> 00:12:58.020
we still have this text on the right-hand side to be centered.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.820
This is okay for the small screen view but for the larger view,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.895
we want to align this text back to the left.

00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:07.745
Inside the media query once more,

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:13.325
let's go down, and we can add this just after the hotel info.

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:16.110
The surrounding div again was

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:26.920
hotel_order_details and all we need to do is add the text line to be on the left.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.685
Save this and then reload,

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:32.930
confirm the form, and there we go.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.095
This looks much better on the larger screen.

00:13:36.095 --> 00:13:40.255
I should shrink this down and check everything still looks fine.

00:13:40.255 --> 00:13:43.800
Excellent, the search results are now working as

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.760
expected and we've also added a little styling.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.130
Next up, we'll stick with the subject of

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.690
the search form by also including more on the hotel detail page.
