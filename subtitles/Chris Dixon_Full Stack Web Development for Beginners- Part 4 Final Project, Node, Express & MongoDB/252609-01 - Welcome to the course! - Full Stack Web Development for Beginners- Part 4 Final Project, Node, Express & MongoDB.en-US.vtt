00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.425
Welcome to Full Stack Web Development for beginners.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:07.890
This course is designed to take you from a beginner to

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.050
a web developer capable of building not only the front-end user interface,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.225
but also to design and build the backend to interact with too.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:24.165
Who am I? My name is Chris and I will be your instructor throughout this course.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:29.595
I am a web developer and also the producer of lots of tutorials,

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:35.470
teaching thousands of students the skills they need to build websites and applications.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.260
This is the fourth part in the full series,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.420
where we will continue to build on everything from the first three parts of this course.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.335
This course is all about moving to the backend of websites,

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:51.350
where you will learn lots of amazing things.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.009
We start off with node and the express framework,

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.935
where we setup a travel book in application called Let's Travel.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.955
We will build this project throughout the course.

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:07.205
Everything you learn will be immediately put into practice.

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:10.550
Node and Express are really popular and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.305
learning these technologies will leave you in high-demand.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:18.560
After this, we move on to routing and templating,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.320
which will allow us to switch between pages and navigate through our app,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.775
along with setting up templates to display not just the content we've created,

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:32.785
we'll too also render data from our database too.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:37.140
Databases is what the next section is all about,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.910
where we'll look at MongoDB and Mongoose.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.120
You will learn so much including modeling our data, create, read,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.655
update and delete actions,

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:55.715
along with filtering and aggregation to get back the exact data which we need.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:02:01.885
After this, we push on with styling and adding lots of nice features to our project,

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:08.510
along with learning many next-generation JavaScript techniques from ES6 and beyond.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.040
You will also learn how to allow users to upload images and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.445
how we can save and retrieved these images from our Cloud storage.

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:23.560
Of course, most apps nowadays need to deal with user accounts and authentication.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.390
This is something which we'll learn about while

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.840
also applying all of these to our project.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.945
You will learn how to create user account,

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:34.430
login in and out,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.025
validating new user's information,

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:41.940
authentication, storing passwords safely and so much more.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.240
We finish off our app by allowing

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.395
the user to place orders and then save them to the database.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:51.530
Then we create an account area where the user can

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.895
log in and see any bookings which they have made.

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:57.290
Also admin users can go into

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.745
the admin section to see lists of all orders which have been placed.

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:05.330
This course ends by showing you some security tips and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.880
recommendations to prepare your application for production.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.615
We then push our app to a live server for the rest of the world to see,

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:17.960
all while explaining things in a straightforward,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.910
simple to understand way,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.534
which even beginners will understand,

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:28.775
along with reinforcing things with a fun yet challenging projects as we go.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:33.065
I hope you're really excited to learn about all of these things,

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:36.150
in the final part of this course.
