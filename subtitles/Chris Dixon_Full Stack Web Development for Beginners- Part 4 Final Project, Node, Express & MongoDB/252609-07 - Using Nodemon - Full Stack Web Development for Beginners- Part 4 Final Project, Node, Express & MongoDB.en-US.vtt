00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.275
We are now going to install a node package,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.275
which will save us a lot of time during this project.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:13.200
If we go over the views inside the menu and then go to index.js,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.130
views, index.js, and then you can go ahead and make

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
a small change to our text inside here.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.590
If we say, welcome to,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.210
and then say, let's travel.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.465
Give a save and then open the browser and then reload.

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:34.610
We see this change has been reflected inside the browser.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.990
This is fine, and this is the result which we would expect.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.900
If now go over to a script file,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.295
such as inside the routes and then go to the index.js.

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:51.500
Let's now make a change inside of here.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.380
The comma is out, it's res.render,/.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.465
Remember this is the line which renders our homepage or our index templates,

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.590
and then instead if we go to the line below,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:12.310
say res.send and then the text off 'hello'.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.880
This will simply send a string of texts to the browser.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.875
Give a save and then reload and see that nothing happens.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:25.415
This is because if we make changes to a script file,

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:27.950
we need to restart the server.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.300
We can do this if we go over to the terminal remember this is view,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.325
and then integrate the terminal,

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:36.394
we can close the terminal downwards,

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:41.330
Control C, and then we're taken back to our directory,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.985
and then again use npm start,

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:46.830
to begin the server once more.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.500
Hit Enter, then once it's running,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.785
we can go to the browser and Hit Reload,

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:56.845
and now the terminal has restarted the server.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:01.750
We'll now see the text of 'hello' has now been updated in the browser.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.610
Although this works fine,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.700
it's a bit of a pain to keep restarting the server,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.075
every time we make a change inside those files.

00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:11.950
To make things easier,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.635
we can use a package called nodemon.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:18.020
If we go over to nodemon.io,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.445
this is the homepage for the nodemon package,

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.145
which we're going to be using.

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:26.830
Nodemon will watch for any changes in

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.610
our source code and then automatically restart the server for us.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.350
We can even install nodemon,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.240
as it suggests, using this npm install command,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.910
the name of nodemon for the package and we may also use

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.810
this -g flag when installing the express generator,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.310
and it means we can use it globally in

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.690
any project and not just the one we are currently working on,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.385
or alternatively, if we just want to use it in our single projects.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.755
This is simple to setup too.

00:02:59.755 --> 00:03:02.170
We can head over to the terminal in

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.270
Visual Studio Code and then close down a terminal again with

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.695
Control C and then run the following command against our npm install,

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.570
and then this time we want to

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:24.015
say --save-dev and in the name of our package, which is nodemon,

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:28.970
Hit Enter and it will go ahead and grab the package from npm,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.375
save dev we'll save this in our project as a development dependency.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:37.045
Meaning we can use it during development,

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:41.435
but is not required when we push the app to production.

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:47.460
Give them moment to install and then once this is done,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.150
if we go over to the sidebar and open up the package.json.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.210
Inside of here we still have our dependencies,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.235
which we've seen earlier but further down we also have

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:03.400
our devDependencies and they're listed as our nodemon package.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.885
Now for this to work in our app,

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.535
we can create a script,

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:09.200
just like the startup script,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.245
which we have at the top here.

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.100
This one I'm going to call devstart.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.300
Add a comma after the first line,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.045
and then we can add devstart.

00:04:20.045 --> 00:04:24.410
This is the alias which we're going to give to this command.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.070
Add a colon, and then inside the quotations,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.320
we're going to add a command which is

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.640
nodemon and then the same path which we have used here./bin/www.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.055
This is going to essentially run

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:49.590
the same startup scripts but this time we're watching for any changes using nodemon.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.380
Give that a save and now we can go ahead and start our servers.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.969
This time if we go over to the terminal,

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:05.595
make sure the server is closed down and then this time can run npm, run devstart.

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:10.095
Of course devstart is the name of our script which we have just here.

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:14.690
Hit enter, once it is up and running,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.740
you should see the green line of code just here and then over to the browser,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.290
hit reload and now everything should still be working.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.025
If we again go over to the index.js file and then make a change.

00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:35.445
Let's say 'hello again'.

00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:37.400
Save and as soon as we hit save,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.545
we can see the terminal at the server has restarted.

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:45.590
Then reload the browser and now we'll see our text has been

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.760
updated without us having to manually update the server.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.835
Let's now reinstate our res.render,

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:57.000
so we can remove the res.send and then command and

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.295
forward slash to now uncomment out this index page,

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:05.690
save this, and then reload and refreshing the browser will

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.190
now show these changes without having to close down the server and restart.
