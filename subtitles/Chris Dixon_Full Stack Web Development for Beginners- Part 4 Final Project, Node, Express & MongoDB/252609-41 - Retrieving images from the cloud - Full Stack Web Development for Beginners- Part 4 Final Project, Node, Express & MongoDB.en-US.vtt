00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.960
We are at good stage now as we can save

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.250
our hotels and also the image is saved to Cloudinary.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.915
We also set the image name to be equal to the unique id,

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:16.650
which is set by Cloudinary when we upload an image.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.990
Therefore, we need to change our image source Tantalus so they display

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.345
correctly from Cloudinary and not just using the images from the public folder.

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:30.135
So we can go to our Project,

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:35.445
go to Inspect, click on our image just here.

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:38.280
This is the file path which we need to amend.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.955
So this can successfully display in our project.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.609
This is a pretty easy effects.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.465
First we can grab the URL from our Cloudinary dashboard.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:54.520
So go to our dashboard just here, click on the link.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.160
Then to grab our URL,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.905
we need to click on the More link just here,

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:05.425
and we have a base delivery URL.

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:07.664
So click on the dropdown,

00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:10.425
and here we're given two different samples,

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.620
so let's copy the URL,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.470
which includes our cloud name in the middle here.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.510
This links to our accounts,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.580
then over to our hotel.pug,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.840
which is the mixin.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.365
I'm just go to Hotel, let's open this up.

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:30.240
We can connect this line out and keep it in for reference,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.035
but we need to create a new image elements.

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:35.300
This time leads at the source,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.595
and we can add these as backticks,

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:40.000
so we can use a variable.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.045
Then paste in our URL.

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:50.090
The last step is to replace this sample.jpg at the end with our unique image name,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.095
which is stored as hotel.image.

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:55.755
So we can you see the template literals,

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.555
open up the braces,

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:01.650
and then hotel.image, outside the braces.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.040
We also need to add the.jpg extension.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.930
If that save, now if we go over to our project,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.550
click on the "Home Page" and then click on "See All".

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.730
If we scroll down,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.365
as expected only our hotel test works for now.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:25.880
Since the image use for this was uploaded to Cloudinary but now the rest of

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.090
the image is broken because these are saved as the hotel name.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.430
Now let's delete any test hotels we may have in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.995
the database and then we need to go through the rest of the hotels and update each image.

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:44.375
This is as simple as going out to the update hotel section of the admin,

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.880
re-uploading the same image.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.845
This will then push it to Cloudinary and get a unique id,

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:53.705
but there is one thing we need to do first.

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.915
Can you think what that may be?

00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:58.785
When creating a new hotel,

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:01.350
we passed through the upload and push

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.880
the Cloudinary middleware first, which is openindex.js.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.354
We run through these two stages before saving these to the database.

00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:15.280
We also need to run through these same two stages when updates into.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.729
So copy the upload,

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.425
pushToCloudinary, and then go down to admin,

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:28.050
hotelId update which is the post request just here,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.450
once that is on a new line.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.825
Then just above we can pass through the first two pieces of middleware when updating two,

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:42.865
since this is also handling the same image uploader,

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:46.455
so let's test this out, so over in the admin.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:49.800
In fact we can remove our test hotels,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.190
so refresh the mLab and sing in.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.140
Let's scroll through any of these,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.880
and this is the test here.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.920
Click on the "Delete" icon there.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.220
We also have test image.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.350
That should be able now down to 12 images.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.150
Back over to the project,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.490
let's head over to the Admin section.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.195
We also need to now go to the Updates,

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:33.840
so Edit, Remove, and then scroll down.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.090
The first one is Hotel1,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.415
so let's do a search for this.

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:41.175
Click on "Update Hotel",

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:44.760
and then all we need to do is click on the "Image",

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.350
select "Hotel1", and then Confirm.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.690
Now we can see we now redirected it to the hotel detail view,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.120
which now has the image.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.640
If we just go to /all,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.790
we should see that the rest of the images still don't

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.065
display because we need to go through each one of these and re-upload the image.

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:11.720
I'm now going to leave you with this task of going through

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.005
the rest of the hotels and updating images,

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:17.015
then comeback in the next video,

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:20.880
where we'll get to work on our hotel search form.
