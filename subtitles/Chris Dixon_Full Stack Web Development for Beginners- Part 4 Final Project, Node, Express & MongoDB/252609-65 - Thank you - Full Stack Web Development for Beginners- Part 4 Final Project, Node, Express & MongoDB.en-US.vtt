00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.605
Congratulations on reaching the end of this course.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.300
I hope you are now a lot more comfortable building

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.850
full-stack web applications using technologies such as Node,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.875
Express, MongoDB, Hotspot, and so much more.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:22.170
We started at the very beginning looking at how Node and Express work,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.515
alongside building the let's travel application.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:27.735
We built page templates,

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.350
used routing to switch between pages,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.150
and learned how all the parts of a Node and Express app fits together.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.640
Then we moved on to how we could integrate databases into all projects,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.025
including modeling our data,

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.855
using various methods to get the correct data when needed,

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:49.415
a long with the essential create,

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.790
read, update, and delete actions.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.540
After this, we reinforced our knowledge by creating

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.945
more of the projects, including different views,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:04.155
controllers, environment variables, file uploads,

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:09.130
and Cloud storage, along with some new techniques from ES6 Onward.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.900
We covered handling user accounts,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.750
including registering and logging in,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.165
validating the user's inputs,

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.165
working with sessions, flash messages,

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.585
and also conditional rendering.

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:24.360
To round off the project,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.005
we handled the user accounts area and also allowed the user to place bookings.

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:36.085
Finally, we pushed our projects to a live server for the rest of the world to see.

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:41.640
Bye for now and hope to see you in another course sometime soon.
