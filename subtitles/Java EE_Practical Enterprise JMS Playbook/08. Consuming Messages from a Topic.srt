00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,828
In the previous section, I showed you how to consume messages from a queue.

2
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:08,939
In this section, I'll show you the equivalent for a topic.

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,250
But I'm only going to show the consumption using a messageListener approach.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,884
There are only a small number of changes,

5
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,894
so if you do require the polling method that we saw in the previous section,

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:21,060
then I think you will be able to work it out pretty easily.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,929
First off,

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,946
I'm going to rename the consumeFromDestination method that I created

9
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:28,115
earlier to something a little bit more suitable,

10
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:33,488
which is consumeFromQueue, which more correctly reflects what it does.

11
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:39,752
Then I'll create a new copy of that method, and rename it consumeFromTopic.

12
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:42,915
The only real implementation detail change is that I'm

13
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:45,350
consuming from a topic rather than a queue,

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,083
but as I already mentioned earlier,

15
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,724
if you pass the destination object into an equivalent method,

16
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:54,801
then it could be used to consume from either or a queue or a topic.

17
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:55,885
Back to our main method,

18
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,119
and I'll make a few small changes here to show that we are

19
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,401
calling the consumeFromTopic method,

20
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:07,000
and that the name of our topic should change, but other than that, it's pretty much identical.
