Sometimes a queue or topic may contain messages of different types,

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.794
and it is possible for consumers to only be sent messages

3
00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:12.316
based on a property of that message.

4
00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:15.763
Now generally I don't do this, if your messages are of different types,

5
00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:18.293
then I generally create a new queue or topic for those,

6
00:00:18.293 --> 00:00:21.216
but you can use this approach if you want.

7
00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:25.719
In this example, I'm putting two messages on a queue.

8
00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.125
One message has a string property defined as CreateOrder,

9
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:33.596
and the other message has the same string property set to the value UpdateOrder.

10
00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:38.999
Now in my application, I only want to receive messages of type CreateOrder.

11
00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.558
Therefore when I create my consumer,

12
00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:46.202
I declare a messageSelector as part of the createConsumer method call.

13
00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:51.272
This messageSelector is a string based on a subset of the

14
00:00:51.272 --> 00:00:53.213
SQL92 Conditional Expression Syntax.

15
00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:54.463
If I start up this application,

16
00:00:54.463 --> 00:01:00.315
then I can see that only the Create Order Message is received by the consumer.

17
00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:03.494
Just to prove that the update order message was actually sent,

18
00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:06.897
if I go and browse the queue in the ActiveMQ Admin console,

19
00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:10.303
then I can see there is still one message on the queue,

20
00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:17.000
and if I look at the content of that message, then it has our update message text.
