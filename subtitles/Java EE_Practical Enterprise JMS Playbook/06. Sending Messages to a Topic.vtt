00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:04.709
Sending messages to topics is obviously very similar.

2
00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.695
I'm going to copy the existing method I have to send a message to a queue,

3
00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:13.172
and rename it to sendTextMessageToTopic.

4
00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:14.505
Rather than creating a queue reference,

5
00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.576
I'm creating a topic reference to a topic called TEST_TOPIC.

6
00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:20.713
That's pretty much all you need to do.

7
00:00:20.713 --> 00:00:24.712
You notice that if you actually pass in the destination object,

8
00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.472
that is the queue or the topic to this method,

9
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:31.153
then the same code could be used to send to either a queue or a topic.

10
00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:32.401
Anyway, back to my main method,

11
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.927
where I need to change the parameters back to be

12
00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:37.066
more suitable to call this method.

13
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.576
So I'm going to go back to the generic ConnectionFactory,

14
00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:46.260
Connection, and session objects, and I change the call to sendTextMessageToTopic.

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.043
Again, let's compile and run this, which takes a second or two.

16
00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:54.996
And then back in the Admin console, I now click on the Topics link,

17
00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:59.635
where if I scroll down, I can see a new topic called TEST_TOPIC,

18
00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.009
which has one message on it.

19
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.384
Jumping back to the code again,

20
00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:09.057
I'm going to show you the topic session-specific implementation of this as well.

21
00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:13.171
Copying the sendTextMessageToTopic method as a basis,

22
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.460
I'll change the second parameter to take a topic session object,

23
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.699
hmm,

24
00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:20.094
looks like I actually forgot to rename the topic object

25
00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:23.203
parameter in the previous example, so let's do that here,

26
00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:28.130
and also change its usage within the createProducer method.

27
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.420
Actually, rather than calling createProducer,

28
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.380
I'm going to change it to call createPublisher,

29
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.737
which returns a type of topic publisher,

30
00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:42.360
which we can still use to send the message to the topic using the send method.

31
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.630
Back to the main method,

32
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.326
and again I'm going to change the ConnectionFactory connection and

33
00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:51.798
session objects to be the topic-specific variants.

34
00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:55.155
Once again, let's compile and run the application,

35
00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:58.305
and when complete, jump back into the Admin console.

36
00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:04.000
I'll refresh the Topics view, and this time I can now see two messages on the topic.
