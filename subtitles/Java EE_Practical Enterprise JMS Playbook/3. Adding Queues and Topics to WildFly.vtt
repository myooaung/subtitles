WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:03.407
Now that we have WildFly up and running,

2
00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:09.002
we can jump to our web browser, and enter the URL localhost and port 8080.

3
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.009
This will bring up the default homepage for the web server.

4
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.044
On that, there is a link to the Administration console, which we'll click.

5
00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:17.573
This is where you enter the management user credentials,

6
00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:21.042
which we created in the previous section.

7
00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:24.145
Once logged in, you need to click on the Configuration tab,

8
00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:25.428
and then go to Subsystems.

9
00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:28.510
Somewhere down the list there should be a message subsystem,

10
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.138
which is actually using ActiveMQ, so we select that.

11
00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:38.402
Then we need to select the default provider, and finally click on Queues/Topics.

12
00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.021
We can now see a list of queues,

13
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:42.429
which includes the dead letter queue and the expiry queue.

14
00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.199
If I click on the Topics tab, then we can see where any topics should be.

15
00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.876
We don't have any yet, so there's nothing displayed.

16
00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:54.755
Jumping back to the queues, let's add a new entry for our typical emails queue.

17
00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:59.422
So I simply click on the Add button, I then enter a name of my queue.

18
00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:02.308
Now I must enter a JNDI name for the queue.

19
00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:06.166
A typical format is java:/jms/the destination type,

20
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:10.565
which in this case is queue, and finally the queue name.

21
00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:12.847
Adding a topic is pretty much identical,

22
00:01:12.847 --> 00:01:16.444
we follow the same procedure from the Topics tab.

23
00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:18.291
This time Orders is the destination name,

24
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:22.607
and the JNDI name refers to a topic rather than a queue.

25
00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:24.885
These JNDI names are important,

26
00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:29.351
as these are what we will need to access the destinations from our code.

27
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:32.695
Actually, while we are here, let's click on the ConnectionFactories link.

28
00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:34.784
Here there are two ConnectionFactories registered,

29
00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:40.241
we'll be using the InVmConnectionFactory with this JNDI name.

30
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:47.000
If you need to add an XAConnectionFactory for use in your application, then this is where you would define it.
