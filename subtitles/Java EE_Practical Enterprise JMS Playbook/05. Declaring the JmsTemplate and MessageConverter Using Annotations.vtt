00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:04.445
First we declare the message converter we will be using,

2
00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:08.735
which is the MappingJackson2MessageConverter.

3
00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:10.339
You need to set the TargetType of the message,

4
00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.122
in our case we want it to be a text message.

5
00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.899
We can also set the name of the JMS property that will be used to store the

6
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.797
fully-qualified class name of the object being serialized.

7
00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:25.307
In our case, we will use _messageType.

8
00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:28.275
So onto the definition of our JMS templates.

9
00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.737
First the definition for queue destinations.

10
00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:34.273
I'm simply creating a new instance of the JmsTemplate,

11
00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:38.914
passing in the cachingConnectionFactory in the constructor.

12
00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:41.532
I'm also setting a dynamic DestinationResolver,

13
00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:44.973
which will allow the template to look up the

14
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:47.007
destinations dynamically based on a name.

15
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.965
Here I'm setting the all-important message converter

16
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:52.077
being that we've just created.

17
00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:54.745
Finally, I'm marking this Bean as Primary,

18
00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:59.542
so this will be the default JmsTemplate across the application.

19
00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.053
Then onto our topicJmsTemplate.

20
00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:10.000
The only difference between this one and the queueJmsTemplate is to call the method setPubSubDomain with a value of true.
