Hi, this is Grant Little from Pluralsight,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,710
and welcome back to this Practical Enterprise JMS Playbook.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,523
In this module,

4
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:11,577
we will briefly touch on how you can browse the messages

5
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:15,677
on a queue without consuming them, and where this can be used.

6
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll look at some useful tools you can use or might need. And finally, we'll look at how you can monitor the health of your JMS solution.
