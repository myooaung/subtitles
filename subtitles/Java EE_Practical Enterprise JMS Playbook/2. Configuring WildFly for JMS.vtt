00:00:01.842 --> 00:00:03.820
So I've downloaded the latest WildFly application

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.988
server and extracted into a folder.

3
00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:08.919
Now I'm doing this in on the Linux Mint operating system,

4
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.215
but if you're using a form of Windows, then there will be an equivalent.

5
00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:15.691
bat file that you can use in place of the.

6
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:17.429
sh files used on Linux.

7
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.495
Now the typical installation of WildFly doesn't actually

8
00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:24.429
enable the JMS feature by default, so we need to change that.

9
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.672
It's pretty simple.

10
00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:27.721
Firstly I cd into the BIN directory.

11
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.765
Actually before I go any further further,

12
00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:32.923
if this is the first time you've installed or used WildFly,

13
00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:34.728
you need to create an admin user account.

14
00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:37.733
To do this, we used the add-user.

15
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.591
sh script.

16
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:39.996
You'll be prompted to select an account type,

17
00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:42.516
and I'm going to use a for a management user.

18
00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:46.551
You then enter a username and a password of your choosing.

19
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:49.043
It will then ask for what groups you want the user to belong to,

20
00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:52.047
in our simple example, we simply hit Enter,

21
00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:53.174
which means none.

22
00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:57.300
The script then prompts for a confirmation that you want to create this user,

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.041
which we obviously do.

24
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:01.381
It will ask you if you're going to be using this user for

25
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.238
connecting to application server processes,

26
00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:05.289
which we aren't, so I enter no.

27
00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.178
Okay, back onto the main topic of starting WildFly with JMS enabled.

28
00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:11.438
Typically you would run the standalone.

29
00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:16.096
sh here, but in our case, we need an additional parameter,

30
00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.200
which tells WildFly to enable all services.

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.463
For that, I use the standalone.

32
00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:33.000
sh --server-config=standalone-full. xml, and that starts the application server up with JMS enabled.
