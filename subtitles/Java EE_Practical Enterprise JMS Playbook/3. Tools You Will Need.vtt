00:00:02.296 --> 00:00:05.823
Generally there are a number of tools you need to run a

2
00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:06.998
successful JMS production implementation.

3
00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:09.798
Again it does depend on the JMS provider you're using.

4
00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:12.002
Some provide tooling out of the box with centralized

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.995
administration and configuration and others don't.

6
00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:18.687
Quite often it depends on the price tag associated with the JMS provider.

7
00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:20.715
If it has a hefty price associated with it,

8
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.797
then I would certainly expect these features.

9
00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:25.550
If you are using an open-source option,

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.290
these two can come with centralized administration,

11
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.856
but often they don't.

12
00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:32.284
Most commands are run on the commandline.

13
00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.891
These require a slightly different approach,

14
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.770
but one you probably need to put some effort into yourself.

15
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.616
For example,

16
00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.839
starting and stopping a cluster JMS implementation often involves

17
00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.003
starting and stopping brokers in the correct order.

18
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.315
During failover scenarios,

19
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.740
how do you fail back to a primary broker if that's required?

20
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.926
Rolling releases of the broker software itself,

21
00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:56.396
updating some configuration that isn't centralized,

22
00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:59.610
these generally all require some form of coordination.

23
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.300
Sometimes it's hard to beat good old Shell or PowerShell scripts for this task,

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.331
but there are alternatives these days.

25
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:08.043
One I personally like to use is Ansible to create

26
00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:10.700
playbooks to control your JMS implementation,

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.159
starting, stopping services, deployments,

28
00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:13.774
etc.

29
00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:21.000
There are a number of courses on Ansible in Pluralsight, so I suggest you go and check these out.
