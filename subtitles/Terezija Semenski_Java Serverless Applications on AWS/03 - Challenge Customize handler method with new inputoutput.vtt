00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.007
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.001
- In this challenge,

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.001
you're asked to write the custom handler method

4
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.008
with new input and output.

5
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.003
Imagine we want to build a function

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.009
that checks if a customer who's shopping

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.007
on some eCommerce website can receive a promotion.

8
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:25.003
In this challenge, we want you to write

9
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:29.000
a lambda function that accepts cart data

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.002
and returns if the customer is eligible

11
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.009
to receive a promotion.

12
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.008
In case the cart sum is higher than 1000,

13
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.006
then the customer can get a 10 percent discount.

14
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:47.001
In case the cart contains coupon code freeshipping,

15
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.001
then the customer is eligible for free shipping.

16
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.007
As an output, you need to return promotion data

17
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.000
with reduced price, free shipping flag

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.003
and a promotion message.

19
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.009
This challenge should take about 10 minutes.

20
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.003
If you get stuck,

21
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.007
