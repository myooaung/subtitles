00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.009
- Before we start diving into installation steps

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.005
and our first lend application,

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.009
we need to set up our AWS development user.

4
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.009
So go ahead and go to the AWS console

5
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.006
console.aws.amazon.com and either sign in or sign up,

6
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.005
if you don't have an account.

7
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.007
This is going to require entering your credit card details,

8
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.001
but don't worry.

9
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.005
You can use the free tier for everything we are doing

10
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:36.008
in this course, so not going to need to pay anything.

11
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.003
Once you have your root login details,

12
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.007
we need to create a development user.

13
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:47.004
It is always a good practice to separate development users

14
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.008
from the root user, to make programmatic requests

15
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.009
to the AWS.

16
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.001
Using the root user gives full access

17
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.005
to all your resources for AWS services,

18
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.002
including your billing information.

19
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:07.009
And moreover, you cannot reduce permissions associated

20
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.008
with your AWS account user access key.

21
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:15.002
You should guard your root user the same way you guard

22
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.003
your credit card number in secret.

23
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:22.002
You have already seen in the AWS sign in console,

24
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.005
there are two types of users.

25
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:29.008
Root user, which is your account user, and IAM user.

26
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:33.006
IAM is short for Identity and Access Management,

27
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:38.001
and is exactly what we need to create our development user.

28
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:43.006
With IAM we can create users, user groups and roles.

29
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:47.002
Each IAM identity can be associated with one

30
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.001
or more policies.

31
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:54.001
Policies determine what actions a user, role or a member

32
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.004
of user group can perform, on which AWS resources,

33
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.004
and under what conditions.

34
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.007
An IAM user is an entity in IAM that should map

35
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:07.009
to an actual human user.

36
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.004
Name and password are used to log in

37
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.003
to AWS management console.

38
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:18.008
And up to two access keys can be used with API or CLI

39
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:23.002
to make programmatic requests to AWS services.

40
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.002
Often you will have multiple IAM users

41
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.001
that need the same IAM permissions.

42
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.003
To make this easier, you can create IAM group.

43
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:36.007
For our development user, we need to create

44
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:40.005
an administrator user and group.

45
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:45.005
So search for IAM or just use slash IAM.

46
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:52.001
In the navigation panel, choose users, and choose add user.

47
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:56.004
Type in administrator and select both programmatic access

48
00:02:56.004 --> 00:03:00.006
and AWS management console access.

49
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:04.001
For password, you can either use autogenerate it,

50
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.004
which will be presented at the end,

51
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:08.009
or type a custom password.

52
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:14.005
Also you can unselect checkbox, require password reset.

53
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.008
Next, we need to create the group.

54
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.005
You can name it administrators.

55
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.003
Select administrator access policy,

56
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:27.001
and click on create group.

57
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:30.007
You can skip tags and go straight to the review.

58
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:35.001
If everything is fine, we can click on create user.

59
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:39.006
And now we can see our development user has been created,

60
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:44.006
but don't go away yet, copy the following three things,

61
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:50.001
console URL, access key, and a secret key.

62
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:53.001
Click the show link to show it.

63
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.001
The last two are secure, so put them

64
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.005
in your password manager together with the console URL.

65
00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.002
If you already clicked away,

66
00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:05.000
unfortunately you cannot retrieve the secret anymore.

67
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.003
Instead you will need to create a new one.

68
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:12.008
You can do that by opening administrator user,

69
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:15.004
navigate to security credentials,

70
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:20.000
and click create new access key.

71
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.009
The access key ID and the secret are used

72
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.009
to make programmatic calls to AWS from CLI, SDK

73
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:32.000
or IntelliJ, which we'll go to in a little while.
