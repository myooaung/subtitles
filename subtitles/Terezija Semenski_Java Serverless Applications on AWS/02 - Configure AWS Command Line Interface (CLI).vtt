00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.005
- There are multiple ways to interact with AWS.

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.006
So far you have used the web interface.

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:11.006
Let's explore other ways to interact with AWS

4
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:17.004
and also take a closer look on how to set up AWS CLI

5
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.008
as it will be required for our development set up.

6
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:25.003
AWS provides services such as S3 for storage,

7
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:28.006
dynamoDB, cloud nine for development

8
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.005
or Lambda for servers applications.

9
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.006
To get access to this services,

10
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:38.005
we need to make HTTP requests to API endpoints.

11
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.009
But, how do we know which APIs to call?

12
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.008
We can browse the AWS documentation

13
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:54.005
Click on a service such as dynamoDB, click on actions,

14
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:59.005
expand the list and see the signature of an API

15
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.008
and if you look at the create table,

16
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.004
you can see an example request.

17
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.006
For this particular one,

18
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.002
we also need to provide authorization hiders,

19
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.000
remember the access key

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.003
and the secret from the previous video.

21
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:19.005
Creating such a request manually seems tedious,

22
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:23.005
as there is a lot of room for error.

23
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:27.009
The easier way is using the AWS management console,

24
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.005
which you already had experience with

25
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.006
once you created the developer account.

26
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.004
Management console behind the scenes

27
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:40.007
is actually consuming the AWS API.

28
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:44.007
But what if you need to create multiple tables

29
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.005
in different regions.

30
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.006
Then things become harder.

31
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.006
If we need to perform repetitive tasks,

32
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.005
the better option is to use the AWS CLI

33
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:58.002
or command line interface.

34
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:04.009
It also uses the API behind the scenes to interact with AWS.

35
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.006
Using AWS CLI, it is easy to control multiple AWS services

36
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.008
and automate them through scripts.

37
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:19.008
We also have AWS toolkit, which is an add on for ID.

38
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:22.000
Toolkit simplifies management

39
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.007
or some AWS resources

40
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:28.009
and uses AWS CLI in the background.

41
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:32.009
We have seen four options to interact with AWS.

42
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:37.000
However, none of these will be used by our code.

43
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.008
Instead, you should use AWS SDK

44
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:43.005
for the language that you're using.

45
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:49.000
To proceed with the local setup, we need to install CLI.

46
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.008
Setting up the CLI

47
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:54.002
will be specific to your operating system.

48
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:58.006
You can find those instructions on AWS documentation,

49
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:02.003
just make sure to install the latest version.

50
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.003
Once the CLI is installed,

51
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:10.001
you can validate your install by running shell AWS version.

52
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.004
Configuration, is really easy.

53
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:16.004
Just type AWS configure,

54
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:19.005
and you will be prompted with four inputs.

55
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:22.003
First two are the access key

56
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:26.006
and secret you could figured previously.

57
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:29.006
Next you can set the default region

58
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.008
because AWS CLI needs to know

59
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:36.005
what regional end points to send your requests to.

60
00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:39.002
You must specify either now

61
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:42.007
or explicitly in commands you provide later.

62
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:46.009
List of region codes are available on the web.

63
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.008
Finally, for the output format,

64
00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:53.008
you can leave the default one, which is Jason.

65
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.005
Let's test out our configuration

66
00:03:56.005 --> 00:04:05.008
by typing in AWS Lambda list functions.

67
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:10.000
We should get an empty list like you can see here.

68
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.008
AWS CLI is one of the easiest ways to access the API calls

69
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:17.006
that you need to make.

70
00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:21.002
It is not as limited as the management console

71
00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:22.009
that can change over time,

72
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.002
and it is easier to document and ultimate

73
00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:31.000
to use across several services and operating systems.
