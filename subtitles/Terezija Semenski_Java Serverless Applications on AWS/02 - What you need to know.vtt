00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Before we begin,

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.009
let's explore what skills and knowledge you will need.

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.002
This course is aimed at intermediate and advanced developers

4
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.008
who want to build and deploy serverless applications

5
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:18.002
in AWS Lambda with the Java programming language.

6
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.003
In order to truly be successful in this course,

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.005
you should have experience with Java server-side development

8
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.009
and advanced understanding of web concepts,

9
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.006
such as implementing REST APIs.

10
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:37.001
An understanding of the AWS cloud system is a benefit,

11
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.007
however, it is not required.

12
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.009
We will be setting up our account

13
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.008
and environment from scratch.

14
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.003
Throughout this course, we will be using Java 11.

15
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:53.007
This is the latest supported version of Java on AWS Lambda.

16
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:58.005
You will also need an IDE, I'll be using IntelliJ,

17
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.000
you can use Java IDE of your choice.
