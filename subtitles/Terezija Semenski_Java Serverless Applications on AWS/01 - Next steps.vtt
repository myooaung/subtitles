00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Terezija] Whoa, you have made it

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.004
to the end of this course.

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.002
You have learned a lot.

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:10.003
Everything from key concepts of AWS serverless,

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.007
benefits and limitations,

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.003
to practical examples and tools

7
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:16.007
that will help you manage

8
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.001
serverless app development in Java.

9
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:24.003
I hope the course gave you a strong foundation of serverless

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.007
and that you will start using serverless

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.008
in your next project.

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.006
But keep in mind, learning doesn't stop here.

13
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.006
We have just scratched the surface.

14
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.008
I would encourage you to check other resources

15
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:43.003
on AWS ecosystem related to serverless

16
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:49.005
like step functions, API gateway, and AWS Cognito.

17
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.008
You can also check out my course

18
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:56.002
on advanced Spring integration testing and Spring events.

19
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.001

20
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.002
