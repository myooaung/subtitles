Hi guys.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,640
Welcome back to this tutorial.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,230
Here we are for a really quick step.

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,540
As you might have noticed if he played through the data we have some really really long sentences in

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,190
this corpus and this is an issue for two main reasons.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,460
The first one is that's when we will pads all the sentences.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,480
So we wanted to make all the sentences the same lines for the batch to work.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,070
We will have a huge data sets and the run might be too small to handle this.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,240
The second reason is that it will take a lot of time to train.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,760
If we keep those really long sentences and for this application we don't need to have all those sentences.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,850
And anyway if you have a very powerful machine or if you have access to any other server that has the

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,840
adequate power you can keep them all out said the threshold higher but for the sake of this application

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:56,850
we will ask to have a maximum length for the sentence to 20 and you might think that it's quite low

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,690
but you will see that it's enough to have really good results.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,030
And we still have a lot of data with this number and unfortunately we can create an array with all the

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,510
sentences and then use powerful tools to remove the one we want to remove because if we want to create

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,210
an array or 10 so we need all inputs to have the same length which is not the case right now.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,370
And if we Bud's right now in order to make them equally long then the 10 or so of the array will be

19
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,700
too big for the run of the server.

20
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:36,320
So we will have to use small tricks and the way we do that is we create the viable which which contains

21
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,780
all the indices we want to get rid of.

22
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:57,470
So I do X to remove will be equal to counts for counts sense sent for a sentence in enumerates inputs

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,550
the any rate function is kind of the same as going through all the inputs but instead of just giving

24
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,730
the sentences once it's time it gives the sentence.

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,570
And as you can see here it counts.

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,240
So the first elements will be zero and the first sentence the second will give one.

27
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,140
And the second sentence and so on.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,580
So this is really handy because we will test if the length of the sentence is too high and if it is

29
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,270
we know that count is the index of this very sentence.

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,550
So we can keep it in memory.

31
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,130
So this is what we are doing right now.

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:44,310
If land of sense is greater is greater than the max length.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,960
So here we are list of all the indices we want to get rid of.

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,280
So let's do it right now.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,000
We will loop of those indices in reverse.

36
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,880
So I will explain right now why we need to do it in a reversed manner.

37
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,860
Basically let's say that we want to remove the second and the fourth elements.

38
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,320
Once we have removed the second elements of the indices of the elements after those one would be shifted

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,660
by one because these one will have disappeared.

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,440
So what is now the fourth elements was the fifth before.

41
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,630
So each time we we remove one elements of the indices after all shifted.

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,160
So we need to process in the reversed order so that we are removing the right elements.

43
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:39,080
And now we use the DL function which allows us to remove elements according to their indices right here.

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,950
So we of course want to do this for the inputs and for the outputs because we want each input too much

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,330
its corresponding outputs.

46
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,930
So now we have removed all the sentences in English that well longer than 20 words and their corresponding

47
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,820
outputs.

48
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,430
And we wanted the same thing for the outputs.

49
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,590
So we want to remove all the sentences in French that are longer than 20 words Let's do it right now.

50
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,680
Let's copy that's posted here.

51
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,770
And basically all we have to change is these spots where we say that we want to use the sentences from

52
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,490
the outputs

53
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,200
and that's it.

54
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,980
We have the code that removes all the sentences that are too long for our application right now.

55
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,960
Actually this part takes some time because as I said before this is really not optimized just because

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,600
we can't create an array or attend 10 so with all of the sentences of the same length this would be

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,230
too big.

58
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,920
And this is why we have to use this little trick.

59
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,750
This is actually the longest part of the proposed setting.

60
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,100
But once this is done everything will be faster and we are almost ready to build our model populace

61
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,950
excited.

62
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,630
Let's go to the next step and see you soon.
