Hi guys and welcome back to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,760
We are now ready to start coding all can stretch are using the transformer.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,970
And of course the first step is to import all of the dependencies that we will use later.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:20,790
So first we will have to import the standouts named by library as NPR.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,600
As always we will perform some mathematical operations so we will import this one too.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,670
Then for the data proposed to seeing as we are dealing with strings we will hugely need these re whatever

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,290
library which is really useful when you want to clean or to perform any operation on strings.

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,660
Mostly when you need rig X and we will need some.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,300
We will come to that later.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,140
Then during the training we will wants to use the time model just to know how long each a box will take

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,330
during the training.

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,290
And finally we will use this one that is related to Google collab.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,800
It's actually used to get all files from the Google Drive.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,590
This is what we have set up in the previous tutorial.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Thanks to this one we will be able to load our data in all notebook.

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,100
Second group of libraries that we wanted to import of course are are the ones related to tensor flow.

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:35,670
So we will do something that only works on Google collab which is to to ask Google collab to use a specific

18
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,850
version of tensor flow.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,020
This is how we write it.

20
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:49,140
So we asked tensor for version to be two point X which is the latest version.

21
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,260
If this doesn't work well too bad we'll just pass by.

22
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,360
Everything should work perfectly fine.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,520
And now we are ready to import tens of flow as T F as per usual containing tons of flow we will also

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,680
use a lot of layers just to make life easier.

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:18,240
We will imports tens of flow that cure us from denser flow that cures.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,950
We will import the latest model so we won't have to write intensive flow that cures the layers that's

27
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,050
dense.

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,260
For instance we will just be allowed to write letters that dense.

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,290
This will make our code more readable and cleaner.

30
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,070
And last but not least.

31
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,410
Doing all data processing.

32
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:48,750
We will have to talk a nice or sentences and this is something that will be done through this library

33
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,880
intensive flow data sets.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,880
TFT s which contains these very useful tool which is the chicken either and

35
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,400
perfect.

36
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,100
Now we can see that the right version of tensor be selected and that we are ready to go to the next

37
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,920
phase.

38
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,660
See you soon.
