1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
Okay,

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,620
so now we're going to speak about selecting and formatting certain sections of our pivot

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:06,920
table.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,990
So first,

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,970
to select informant a certain section,

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,540
we need to make sure that an option is enabled on our pivot table.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,760
So,

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,280
first of all,

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,470
we need to select a cell inside our pivot table,

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,530
and then we're going to go to the analyze,

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,430
stab on the ribbon and then go to select,

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,740
and then you need to make sure there's an option called enable selection.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,400
You need to make sure that this is enable it's currently enabled,

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,830
and you will see that it has ah,

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,920
gray filling here in sight.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,940
If I disable it,

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,190
you'll see that the great feeling will disappear.

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,750
So you just need to make sure it's enable and it has that grey feeling here inside.

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,780
So now,

20
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,940
with enabled selection of a certain section of our pivot table.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,160
Now let's say we want to select a certain product here and change its color in this pivot

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,520
table.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,000
So I say I'm gonna hover over product one.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
And when I have this arrow here,

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,930
this thick black arrow pointing towards the right,

26
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm just gonna collect here and you can see here,

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,620
it's selected Product one.

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,680
Now I'm gonna go to the home tab on the ribbon.

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,230
I'm gonna make Let's say I'm gonna make the fund reds and as you can see here now we have

30
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,050
the fund for product one red.

31
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,120
So if you actually change the layout over pivot table So say we moved the product names to

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,150
the column section he can see here that product one after being moved to the column section

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,810
is still having a red fund.

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,140
Now will press control and Z on my keyboard to get the pivot table to the previous layout

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,560
again.

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,380
Now let's say I want to change the color for quarter one in all the products to yellow the

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,010
fill color.

38
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,970
So I'm just gonna hover over key one until I get this arrow here and then I'm gonna press

39
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,400
on it and you could see your key.

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
One is highlighted on all the products.

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,180
I'm just gonna make it yellow the fill color here.

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,260
And now we have you one in yellow.

43
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,490
Now,

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,720
if you move the quarter to the column section of a pivot table,

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,070
you can see here that key one is yellow on all the products.

46
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,030
It remains yellow.

47
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,510
After we changed the layout of our pivot table,

48
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,510
press control and Z back here,

49
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:10,950
too,

50
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,300
put the pivot table back to its previously out.

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,860
Now let's say I want to apply a change to all the role labels here for all the products.

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,390
So I'm just gonna hover over my product,

53
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,070
any product,

54
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,030
just product one,

55
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,770
for example.

56
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,230
And I need to hover over and be on the right hand side a bit to the right,

57
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,920
and I will have a narrow ethic,

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,580
arrow pointing downwards here.

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,860
So I'll just click here and deacons here.

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,050
I've selected all the row headings for all the products.

61
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,180
Now let's say I'm just going to increase their fund size like this.

62
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,520
And also now,

63
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,850
if I put them to the column section instead of the Rose section,

64
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,950
you can see here that the product labels have a bigger fund size for all the products.

65
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,870
I'll press control and Z on my keyboard to put the pivot table back in the previous form,

66
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,370
You can also apply certain formatting to a Hill column.

67
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,570
So,

68
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,220
for example,

69
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,570
let's say when I apply is certain formatting to the year 2017 here.

70
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,350
So I'm just gonna have our over until I get this arrow pointing downwards.

71
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,180
And now I can actually put a border around it.

72
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,690
So I put a thick outside border here around it around 2017 for example.

73
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,620
And then if I change how my pivot table look,

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,640
So move the quarter,

75
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,180
for example,

76
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,950
toe the columns.

77
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,060
You can see here that 2017 has a thick water around it,

78
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,400
even after we changed.

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,190
How are pivot table looks?

80
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,780
So all press control and Z,

81
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:31,960
um,

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
a keyboard here to go back,

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,290
and you could basically do the same thing for any section in the pivot table.

84
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,070
Just make sure to hover over the section until you see the arrow and then click on it and

85
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,700
highlighted,

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,600
Then apply whatever formatting you would like.

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,720
And this romantic will stick to it even when the layout or the orientation of the pivot

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,390
table would change.

89
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,090
Now we've spoken about selecting each individual section on our pivot table.

90
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,360
So how do we select the whole pivot table?

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Well,

92
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,360
there are two ways the first way is to go to the very most upper left corner here,

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
which is this cell and under the sum of sales amount.

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,220
Here you can see the arrow.

95
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,190
If you click on it,

96
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,270
you will select the whole pivot table.

97
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,880
Another way,

98
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,870
which is much easier,

99
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,700
in my opinion,

100
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,980
is to go to the analyzed tab on the ribbon,

101
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,730
go to select and then entire pivot table,

102
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,380
and this will select the whole pivot table for you.

103
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,460
And then you can delete it to press delete on your keyboard and you pivot table will be

104
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,070
delete it.

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,410
Just press control NZ on my keyboard here to restore my pivot table again.

106
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:36,750
OK,

107
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,530
so that's it for selecting and formatting.

108
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,700
I'll see you on the next one.
