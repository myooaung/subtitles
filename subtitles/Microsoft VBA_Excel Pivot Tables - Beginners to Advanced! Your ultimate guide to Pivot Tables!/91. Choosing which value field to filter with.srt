1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
in this video,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,840
we're going to see how we can choose the value field to filter with in case we have

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,060
multiple value fields.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,770
So here I've got my pivot table where we have the region on the road section and we get the

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,590
soda sales amount on this emission of value section.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,070
And let's say that in addition to the sum of sales amount value Field,

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,900
I would also add the average off sales.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,130
So to do that,

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,690
I'm just going to drag here the sales amount field again to this emission value section and

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:38,160
then click on a good to value field settings and choose the summarized value fueled by twos

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,100
average here.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,050
And then I'm gonna give this a custom name of average sales,

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,990
and I'm going to click OK,

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,300
here.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,590
So as you can see here now,

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,250
I have my data aggregated by the summation of sales amount and also the average of sales

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,100
about now,

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,880
in order to choose which value feels to filter with when you click here on the field

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,750
headers and then click on value filters and then go to greater than or equal to,

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,650
for example,

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,080
you can choose here from this drop down menu,

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,900
which value field you need to filter with.

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,020
So here I'm gonna choose tea filter with the average sales,

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,850
and I'm gonna filter for average sales greater than 60,000 for example.

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,340
And I'm going to click OK,

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,950
here says you can see her now.

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,740
I only have one reason remaining,

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,080
which is Australia,

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,850
because it's average sales is greater than or equal to 60,000.

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,830
Now,

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,040
unfortunately,

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,470
I'm not able to apply another filter with this summer sales amount simultaneously.

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,930
So if we go again here,

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,410
value filters and then greater than or equal to and go to some of sales amount.

35
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,690
If we apply a filter,

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,240
for example,

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:04,410
for sales amount greater than 1,300,000 and click OK here because here that the second

38
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,750
filter has overridden the first filter.

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,890
So now the two filters is not being applied simultaneously.

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,220
Actually,

41
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,750
the second filter now is has overridden the first filter.

42
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,160
So,

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,850
unfortunately,

44
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,810
I'm not able to apply both filters at the same time.

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,370
So this is how you can choose which value field to filter with in pivot table
