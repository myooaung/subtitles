00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310
Hey,

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,560
guys,

3
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,200
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,180
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,920
we're going to show how we can refresh multiple pivot tables in a workbook that have

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,530
different data sources.

7
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,440
So here we've got to pivot tables on this worksheet.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,830
We get the pivot table on the left,

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,970
which is linked to data one,

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,110
or has its data sources data one.

11
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,480
And we get the pivot table here on the right,

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,190
which is linked to data to or has its data source as date is too.

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,450
So basically,

14
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,330
we're going to make changes to both data sets and see how we can refresh both pivot tables

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,150
at the same time.

16
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,210
So here,

17
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,490
we're going to make a change on data one for product 1 2016 So go to data one and have

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,590
highlighted the seldom gonna change here.

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,210
And I'm gonna put one million here on the sales amount and for data to as well of

20
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,310
highlighted this selling gonna change,

21
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,170
which is for product to in 2016 as well.

22
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:58,750
So I'm gonna put one million as well on this cell and then to refresh both pivot tables

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,220
were going to go to the data tab here on the ribbon.

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,130
And then we've got a button here that says,

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,150
Refresh all.

26
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,750
And there's an arrow is well,

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,040
you compress on the arrow and click on Refresh Old.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,180
Or you can click on the button and just refresh all the pivot table.

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,730
So you can see here that both pivot tables have been refreshed with the changes,

30
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,700
and the changes have reflected on both pivot tables when we clicked on refresh all.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,030
So when you click on re fresh old,

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,580
you refresh Oh,

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,310
the pivot tables in your workbook,

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,650
even if they have different data sources.

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:31,940
OK,

36
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,640
so this is how you can refresh all the pivot tables on your workbook,

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,730
even if they have different air sources,

38
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,000
which is using the refresh old feature here in Excel.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,580
OK,

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,680
so thanks guys watching,

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,650
I'll see on the next one.
