00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
if you're pivot Table is built over a huge amount of data.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.980
So hundreds of thousands of rose,

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.650
for example,

4
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.470
sometimes in depending on the power of your computer,

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.880
it might take a long time for the life preview to be generated when you drag and drop the

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.910
fields into the different areas of the pivot table.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.530
So a nice solution to do,

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.000
which is to actually check this differ a layout update box here,

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.560
which basically delays the layout update until you click the update button.

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.620
So as you can see air if I put the sales amount,

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.590
you can see here that the Life preview on the Left has not been updated with the sales

12
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.380
amount field,

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.760
so you can put whatever fields you would like here.

14
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.690
So put the product name as well,

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.970
I know.

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.210
Put,

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.790
for example,

18
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.310
the sales year here and then at the end,

19
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.060
after putting all my fields are click on update and everything gets updated.

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.790
So this tip is useful when you have hundreds of thousands of data underlying your pivot

21
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.520
table and generating the life preview is going to be slow,

22
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.410
and you might not have the strongest computer in terms of specifications.

23
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.170
So it's better to defer the layout update until the end and then just click on the update

24
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.670
button to update your data so as to do the update process to do it just one time instead of

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.080
doing it several times.

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.570
Because basically,

27
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.650
there is a Realtor Time update,

28
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.620
as you add,

29
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.250
feels to different areas of the pivot tables to do it all just one time at the end,

30
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.650
instead of doing it several times.
