00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
Okay,

2
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:00.720
guys.

3
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.490
So now let's start having another case study and exploring another data set using pivot

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.950
tables.

5
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.710
So this is another data set that I got from stats Canada on it has the month and the

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.950
province or territory and the industry and the average weekly hours that people work in

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.680
that particular industry.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.210
Okay,

9
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.750
so this is a data set that speaks about how many hours,

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.850
on average,

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.330
people work every week in different industries,

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.860
in different provinces and in different months.

13
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.190
So,

14
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.840
as you can see here,

15
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.320
the data set has this column here for the month.

16
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.860
So goes like January 2016 February 2016 Marsh 2016 and so on and so forth.

17
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.210
And that's all the way till 2000 and 90.

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.480
So this is the data set that we have sets start exploring that day,

19
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.820
is it?

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.470
First of all,

21
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.390
let's do some number formatting here.

22
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.310
So on the month column,

23
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.150
it's formatting.

24
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.320
Here is day,

25
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.780
month,

26
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.100
year.

27
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.950
We could change the formatting to make it easier to read,

28
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.020
So I'm just gonna highlight the whole call,

29
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.600
impress control in one on my keyboard and go to custom,

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.980
and instead of this formatting I'm actually going to go with Ah,

31
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.630
month.

32
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.580
Mm dash Y y.

33
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.600
So it reads January 16 February 16 and so on and so forth.

34
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.670
This makes it much easier to read here and now.

35
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.200
Ah,

36
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.950
you can see here.

37
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.870
I've got a column here that is called the average weekly hours is the average weekly hours

38
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.850
that people worked in that particular month.

39
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.740
Um,

40
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.550
so I'm actually gonna create another column here,

41
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.350
and I'm just gonna call it standard work hours,

42
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.600
which is basically a column that that will contain 40 in all the values here.

43
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.360
So,

44
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.410
as you know,

45
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.540
people work 40 hours per week.

46
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.860
That's the standard work week for for people,

47
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.350
usually.

48
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.070
So I'm just gonna create that Call him here because I'm actually gonna create E a

49
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.490
calculated column that is basically the division of the average weekly hours by the

50
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.620
standard work hours,

51
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.560
and it's gonna be a fraction,

52
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.430
and it's going to be at the work hours Index is gonna be on index.

53
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.300
That points to how many hours people work,

54
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.450
or it's gonna be useful in comparing the working hours for different people in different

55
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.120
industries.

56
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.080
So you will see how we're going to do that.

57
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.900
So I've got my table here.

58
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.380
Ready?

59
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.820
I've already created a table here on my data set,

60
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.870
so I'm just gonna insert a pivot table here.

61
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.680
So I'm gonna go to the insert tab on the ribbon here,

62
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.580
and then I'm gonna go toe pivot table,

63
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.960
and then I've already called my table here.

64
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.000
TBL data.

65
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.220
I'm just gonna insert a pivot table in and you worksheet no press.

66
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.670
Okay.

67
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.450
Here and now I've got my pivot table.

68
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.590
And now what I'm going to do is that I'm gonna put here the province or territory on the

69
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.500
roads section.

70
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.240
I'm gonna put the industry under it as well under the province and territory.

71
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.910
And I'm actually gonna put my average weekly hours here,

72
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.160
so I'm gonna put it here on the submission of Value section.

73
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.100
As you consider it's summing up all the hours and older months and the years,

74
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.320
right,

75
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.290
because we don't have a filter yet on the months or the years.

76
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.310
This is why you see these big numbers.

77
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.800
So what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna create here at my calculated column that I told

78
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.350
you about.

79
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.700
I'm gonna go here to field fields,

80
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.280
items and sets under pivot table,

81
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.660
analyze eso.

82
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.050
I'm gonna go here and create a calculated field.

83
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.780
Eso I'm gonna call it work hours index,

84
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.450
and this index is basically going to be my average weekly hours divided by this standard

85
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.300
work hours.

86
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.930
Okay?

87
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.340
And I'm just going to click OK here.

88
00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.420
And I don't need the average weekly hours here anymore on the value section.

89
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.600
And so I'm actually gonna work with this index because it's gonna help me compare how many

90
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.800
hours people work relative to each other.

91
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.500
And I'm actually gonna change the formatting for that column here.

92
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.200
Just gonna give it less decimal places.

93
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.220
So I'm gonna go with three desperate places.

94
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.140
That's enough here,

95
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.320
and a Z can see her.

96
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.410
It's giving me a number here,

97
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.060
that is ah,

98
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.320
around one.

99
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.020
So it could be also a fraction could be more than one.

100
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.930
In some cases,

101
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.970
it people work excessive hours,

102
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.590
so you can see it gives me a fraction.

103
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.000
That shows me how many hours people work relative to each other.

104
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.850
So I can also sort that so Aiken sort that in descending order and and this helps me

105
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.350
basically know which industries in which provinces work the most hours and ah,

106
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.950
also,

107
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.360
I can do something else which could help me also read this status that easier and visualize

108
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.750
the working hours easier.

109
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.330
I can actually create a heat map.

110
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.790
So I'm just gonna press control shift down to highlight the whole column here.

111
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.770
I'm gonna go to conditional formatting,

112
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.420
and I'm gonna go to my color scales and I'm gonna choose this color scale here which would

113
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.040
give the lowest values here,

114
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.770
the lowest indices it would give them ah,

115
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.850
greenish color.

116
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.160
And then the other indices.

117
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.980
It would give them,

118
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.550
you know,

119
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.600
more of a reddish colors and then the ones in the middle,

120
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.750
it would give them a yellow color.

121
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.330
And now I have some sort of a spectrum here on how many hours people work compared to each

122
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.750
other.

123
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.630
So I can see here,

124
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.290
for example,

125
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.040
that people in Alberta working in machine shops turn products screw and not on bold

126
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.870
manufacturing.

127
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.920
So people working machine shops,

128
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.710
the work the most hours and I can Sierra's well that people who work in the offices of

129
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.060
other health practitioners thes work the least hours people working in schools as well

130
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.400
technical and trade schools.

131
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.840
These work the least hours and in the middle.

132
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.770
We've got all the other industries here.

133
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.080
You can see we've got a lot of industries year said this.

134
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.860
It makes me able to get an idea about how many hours people work in different industries

135
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.520
and you can see here.

136
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.100
I've got some sort of a scale year and as many managed to sort my values to make them,

137
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.560
ah,

138
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.760
lot easier to read.

139
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.050
So this is a good idea,

140
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.820
um,

141
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.790
to be able to explore and your data set and makes sense of your data and make it much

142
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.750
easier to visualize your data here by creating a heat map.

143
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.670
I could do something else,

144
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.910
which is that I could also add the month here to the column section,

145
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:59.380
and I might be interested in a general trend on which months people work the most on which

146
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.050
industries.

147
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.220
So I'll just have the month only consider when I added the month.

148
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.410
It also put the years and the quarters.

149
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.850
But I'll remove the quarters and remove the years,

150
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.890
and I might be just interested in a general trend over the years which industries people

151
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.110
work in the most Nickens eras.

152
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.480
Well,

153
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.560
there were some months here where we didn't have any data for them,

154
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.480
So give me a divided by zero.

155
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.650
But I can solve this problem easily by right clicking on my pivot table here and going to

156
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.980
my pivot table options and then for air values.

157
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.130
I'm just going to show nothing and is because here they are just gonna be blanks here

158
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.360
instead of the ugly,

159
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.790
divided by zero errors.

160
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:44.420
And this helps me here a determine which our which months people work the most on which

161
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.270
industries Years.

162
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.150
I'm going to some sort of a heat map here.

163
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.690
Ah,

164
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.660
for every province as well.

165
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.950
And I'll just collapse here,

166
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.900
all the province and you can see here that Ah,

167
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.630
for example,

168
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.320
in the Northwest Territories,

169
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.140
people work the most in September,

170
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.030
for example,

171
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.000
while,

172
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.640
for example,

173
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.590
in Ontario people work the least in October.

174
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.460
I believe this is the least value here,

175
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.050
so yeah,

176
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:18.470
it helps me get a heat map on which months people work the most in general and ah,

177
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:25.710
the grand total here helps tell me which province people work the most on overall.

178
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:32.020
But this this heat map is useful here to tell me you know which which province is people

179
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:38.630
work the most on and which months people work the most on and also I Kenbrell eket down in

180
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.370
each province.

181
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.500
So if I click here on this plus button,

182
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.110
it tells me in each province,

183
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.910
um,

184
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:50.140
through the seat map which months work people work the most on the least on in which

185
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.690
industries.

186
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.160
So,

187
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.830
for example,

188
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.260
here on the force tree on logging Ah,

189
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:55.920
in Ontario,

190
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.960
people work the least here in October.

191
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.180
You consider there's significant drop in their working hours in the average weekly working

192
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.800
hours in October.

193
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.250
But they work a lot in December and that's Ah ah,

194
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.480
that's that's a bit of ah,

195
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.150
we're thing,

196
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.530
because December is when it starts to get cold.

197
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.040
But there must be a reason for that.

198
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.500
Is that I don't know.

199
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.120
So you know this contributor,

200
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.980
You toe socks off some questions or do some research about that.

201
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.720
You can also see here that people in that in construction,

202
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.200
they work the most in June,

203
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.840
and that makes a lot of sense because here in Canada,

204
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.550
construction is done the most in summer.

205
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.080
This is when you know construction starts to get really active.

206
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.500
Construction workers work the most hours in summer,

207
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.000
but then things start to drop down,

208
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.710
you know,

209
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.450
in winter.

210
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:58.050
So as you can see her in December of starting from December and then January and February

211
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:58.700
is one,

212
00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.140
actually,

213
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.400
and even Marsh Marsh is even the least ah,

214
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.890
month that the construction workers work on and sincere that these months are the months

215
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.180
with the least activity.

216
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.110
And I know some friends who work in the construction sector,

217
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.020
and they take actually the whole winter as as an off time.

218
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.220
They don't work in winter that you don't work in December,

219
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.090
January and February,

220
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.290
the take three months off,

221
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.710
and then they work really hard in the rest of the months.

222
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.300
So that makes ah lot of sentence.

223
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.730
So,

224
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.040
you know,

225
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.690
it helps me.

226
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.750
Helps you discover patterns in your data this way by creating a heat map.

227
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.470
Another way to visualize your data is using charts.

228
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.740
So I created another top year,

229
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.190
and I click created another pivot table here.

230
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.720
I'm just gonna call this pivot table has say,

231
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.180
PVT charts,

232
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.900
for example,

233
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.440
So this this is the pivot table where we're going to do a chart.

234
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.500
You can call it anything,

235
00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.980
Of course.

236
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.160
And ah,

237
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.170
I'm just gonna go here to the insert tab,

238
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.320
and then I'm gonna go to my recommended charts,

239
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.460
and I actually want to draw a line chart.

240
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.290
So I'm gonna click okay here because I want to see the provinces against each other.

241
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.270
Um,

242
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.770
you know how many hours people work on those provinces,

243
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:27.330
but I actually want to put my months here on the horizontal axis on the X axis.

244
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.930
So I'm just going to right click here,

245
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.930
and I'm actually going to go to my select data here,

246
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.940
and I'm going to switch rows and columns here and I'm gonna click,

247
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.540
OK?

248
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.920
And you can see here.

249
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.830
I now got what I wanted,

250
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.800
but there are too many provinces here on my chart,

251
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.520
so it's better to filter my provinces.

252
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.930
So I'm actually going to create a slicer here to make filtering my problems it easy.

253
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.720
So I'm just going to right click here on province or territory and I'm just gonna add a

254
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.550
slicer,

255
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.450
and I am going to increase the number of columns on that.

256
00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.890
Okay,

257
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:10.910
eso as to be able to get many promises.

258
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.320
So I think this this could be a good size now,

259
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.850
OK,

260
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:23.370
so I'm just gonna put it here and now I can filter for some off the provinces,

261
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.080
and it can also do it on the chart,

262
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.650
by the way,

263
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.820
so I can click here,

264
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.610
and I can,

265
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.260
you know,

266
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.430
compare provinces to each other.

267
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.680
So,

268
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.570
Aiken filter Ontario,

269
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.810
for example only.

270
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.600
And now I can see,

271
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.840
like,

272
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:42.310
an overall trend on when people work the most or the least in Ontario.

273
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.870
And I'm just gonna remove these grid lines here.

274
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.270
So as you can see her,

275
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.160
um,

276
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.770
I can see ah,

277
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.110
trend on how many work hours or what the pattern is for people working in Ontario.

278
00:12:54.110 --> 00:13:01.490
I'm just gonna right enabled the HRT of work index pattern per month.

279
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.010
So this is a pattern here off people in Ontario.

280
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.110
You can see here the work rate or ah,

281
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:13.190
you know how many hours people work starts to drop here in September every year,

282
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.970
and it reaches the least in October.

283
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:23.290
And I think this might be because people start studying or going to university in Ontario

284
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.880
and all over the country,

285
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.880
actually in September and October.

286
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.280
So they're working hours start to drop because sometimes people would are working in the

287
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.340
summer on then studying starts in in September or October.

288
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.870
So this is when they're working hours drop again and you can see here the work hours they

289
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.590
reached their peak in June.

290
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.820
And this is in general across all the industries.

291
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.070
So this is not specific to any one industry.

292
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.740
And also filter that that chart or add another province to comparison.

293
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.380
You can compare Ontario and Quebec for examples,

294
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.170
or you can select it from the slicer.

295
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.110
Or you could select it here from the filter on the chart.

296
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.830
I compressed control on my keyboard president,

297
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.050
hold control in select Quebec as well,

298
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.320
so as to compare,

299
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.060
for example,

300
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.240
Quebec with Ontario.

301
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.470
And you can see here that there is a pattern in Quebec where actually the working hours

302
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.860
increase in October as opposed to a monetary award.

303
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:30.170
Working hours reach their lowest point in Ontario in October.

304
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:36.700
So this is a behavior all over the province that we would need to know why is that the case

305
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:36.700
?

306
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.980
This this could make you ask questions.

307
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:48.010
Why do people work more our or people's working hours to take it on uphill and reach?

308
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.370
There's there's Ah,

309
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.020
it's not.

310
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.550
It's not the highest point,

311
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.460
but it's one of the high points here on their pattern,

312
00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:00.630
So you might ask that question So this is helpful if you want to compare provinces overall

313
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:00.630
.

314
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:00.730
And,

315
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:01.190
of course,

316
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.810
you can add a slicer for the industry as well.

317
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.330
If you want to slice by a certain industry,

318
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.170
there are many,

319
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.040
many industries.

320
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.160
So this way you know you can compare Ah,

321
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.940
work in different industries in different provinces.

322
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.070
So as you consider this industry here,

323
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.180
the cloth clothing,

324
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.330
accessories on other this this only has data for connected.

325
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.190
So there's no data for interior about me.

326
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.230
The healthcare should have data.

327
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:34.180
All in all the problems is so you can you're able to compare different provinces in terms

328
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.810
of the working hours across different industries.

329
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.030
This is very helpful.

330
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.670
If you're in a certain industry,

331
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.740
I care a lot about you.

332
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.770
Work like balance.

333
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.390
You want to know how many working hours people work in each province,

334
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:53.810
or where is the province that I can live in that has the best work life balance where it

335
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.210
would work the least hours,

336
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:55.430
You know,

337
00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:00.120
these air answers that you can get using pivot tables.

338
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.200
Okay,

339
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:08.540
so this is a demonstration in a case study on how to use pivot tables to answer these

340
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.330
questions are hope.

341
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:09.610
Guys,

342
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.820
you found this video helpful.

343
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.650
We're gonna have some homework as well for this data set.

344
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:19.910
So thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
