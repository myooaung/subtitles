00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
What we have here is a pivot table having our sales per month for 2016 and 2017.

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.310
And as you can see here,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.380
we've got two filters on our pivot table.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.690
We've got the customer filter and the region filter.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.870
What we need to do is to create a worksheet for each customer here,

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.830
our customers air three companies Millennium,

7
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.080
true life and visionary.

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.230
And we need to create a worksheet for each customer having a pivot table with the numbers

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.400
for that particular customer filtered.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.520
So where we can do is select a cell Insight are pivot table,

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.500
go to the analyzed tab on the ribbon and then under options.

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.690
Here we go to show,

13
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.120
report,

14
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.970
filter pages,

15
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.480
and then we're going to select our customer show all report,

16
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.500
filter pages off.

17
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.600
We're gonna select customer,

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.830
and this will create a worksheet or a tab in a workbook for each particular customer.

19
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.210
So we're gonna have three tops for each other three customers if you click.

20
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.630
OK,

21
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.000
here.

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.070
You can see here we've got a top for millennium,

23
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.330
Another one for true life,

24
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.590
Another one for visionary.

25
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.130
And as you can see in each worksheet or in each top you can see here the pivot table is

26
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.030
filtered for that particular customer.

27
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.830
As you can see here,

28
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.440
true life is filtered for to life,

29
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.160
and visionary is filtered provisionally.

30
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.900
Now what we can do is that we can group these sheets and print them,

31
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.660
for example,

32
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.690
so that we can have a page for each customer.

33
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.670
So to do that,

34
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.710
we're going to select one customer,

35
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.780
and then we're gonna present hold the shift bun,

36
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.650
and then we're going to select here.

37
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.260
The sheet for the loss concerns you consider it selects all the sheets in between on now we

38
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.520
can press control and pee on our keyboard for printing.

39
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.590
And now we can print the worksheet you can see here.

40
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.670
We've got three pages,

41
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.920
one for millennium,

42
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.080
the other one here for true life and 1/3 1 for visionary.

43
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.790
Now we can print our report here.

44
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.200
We're gonna print it to a pdf,

45
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
so I'm gonna click on print here and now I'm gonna save it to my desktop.

46
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.250
And this is gonna be sales per customer.

47
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.220
I'm going to save it.

48
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.970
And when we open our pdf,

49
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.570
you can see here We've got a pdf report here with the sales for each of our customers on a

50
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.700
different page.

51
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.420
Now we can UN group are sheets by right clicking on any of them and then on group sheets.

52
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.670
And this is how you can own group your sheets again after grouping them.

53
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.320
And now this is how you can spread a filter on multiple worksheets so that you can print a

54
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.210
report with each item off the filter on a different page.
