1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
and this video,

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,960
we're going to speak about the percentage apparent row total calculation aint pivot tables

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:05,960
.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,240
So the percentage apparent row total calculation displays the percentage of an item from

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,550
its parent row total.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,760
So we can display,

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,450
for example,

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,700
the percentage of Q three in America sales from the total sales for America's.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,880
So let's have an example here.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,660
So I'm gonna drag the sales amount field again here to create another field of the sales

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,070
amount.

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,550
And then I'm going to click on it good to value field settings and then go to show values

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,030
as.

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,800
And then I'm going to select percentage your parent row total.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,350
And then I'm gonna change its name here.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,590
Percentage of parent trow and then I'm going to click OK,

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,000
here.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
And as you can see here,

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,530
we get the percentage of the parent TRO for each item.

20
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,370
So here,

21
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,930
for example,

22
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:58,110
7.6% for key one is basically it's saying that key one is 7.6% of the total sales in the

23
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,050
Americas and Q two is 32 point 63% of the total sales in the Americas as well.

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,760
And here when we say that on the Americas is 21.9%.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,660
That means that the Americas are 21.9% off their parent row.

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,420
So the parent TRO,

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,280
because the Americas heir a sub total their parent rose actually the grand total year at

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,850
the bottom.

29
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:29,650
So this means that the Americas are 21.9% of the grand total off the sales,

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:37,990
and Australia is 17.47% of the grand total of the sales in 2016 and so on and so forth.

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:45,400
So this calculation displaced the percentage of each item from its parent row.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,660
Another example that we can have here is displaying the percentage of each month from its

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,340
parent row.

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,010
In this case,

35
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,430
in the case of this pivot table,

36
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,470
which is its year so we can do the same here,

37
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,030
drag another one for the sales amount and then go to value field settings here show values

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,610
as percentage of parent row total,

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,700
and then we could name this percentage of year,

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,490
for example,

41
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,230
and if you click OK,

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,660
here,

43
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,480
you can see here the it displays the percentage of each month from its parent here.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,520
So here February under 2016 is 5.42% of the year 2016.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,040
And actually,

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,440
the year 2016 is 52.2% of the grand total for 2016 and 2070.

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,850
I need to also add one more thing here,

48
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,780
which is that when we say that a field is the parent of another field,

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,560
the reason that it's apparent of another field is that it's above it here in the hierarchy

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,580
on the Rose section here.

51
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,330
So here the year is the parent troll of the sales month because it's above it on the

52
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,450
hierarchy here on the Rose section.

53
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,890
The same goes here on the first example where the region is the parent of the quarter,

54
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,560
because it's above it here on the roast section.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,170
So actually,

56
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,750
if we put the quarter above the reason like this,

57
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,840
the quarter will be the parent of the region.

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
So this is what it means when you do a percentage of the parent total here,

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,600
which is that it displays the field as a percentage of its parent.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,530
So thanks,

61
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,170
guys were watching and I'll see you on the next one
