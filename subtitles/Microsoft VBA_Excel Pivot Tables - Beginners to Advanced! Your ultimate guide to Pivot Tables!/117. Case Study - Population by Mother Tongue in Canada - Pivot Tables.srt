1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
Alright,

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,660
guys.

3
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,150
So now we're gonna have some practical examples and case studies for using pivot tables.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,940
So I'm going to get some data from some statistics website like Stats Canada,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,120
for example on we're going to start exploiting this data with pivot tables and try to

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:24,180
understand the data and draw conclusions from it because this is the ultimate goal at the

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,840
end of the day,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,260
from using pivot tables.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,800
Anyways,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,540
the ultimate goal is to actually be able to understand your data and analyzing.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,360
So this state of here of gas and data that I got from Stats Canada and it's about the

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,870
population by mother tongue in Canada.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,930
So this data shows how many people speak English as their mother tongue or French or any

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,680
other non official language in Canada's.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,680
So So it shows whether people speak English or French,

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,880
which are the two official languages in Canada.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,550
Or it shows if someone is speaking any other language other than English and French as his

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,880
for first language.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,090
So this shows the first language of the people,

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,400
their mother tongue.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,790
And,

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,160
you know,

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Canada has a lot of immigrants,

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,500
has a great immigrant population,

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,070
so their mother tongue.

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,710
There's ah,

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,510
there's a lot of people in Canada that don't have their mother tongue is the English or the

28
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,650
French language.

29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,150
It could be any other language.

30
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,250
So we're gonna use pivot tables on this data and try to understand it and maybe draw some

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,360
pivot charts and draw some conclusions out off the data.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,990
So I get this data from Stats Canada and I cleaned it using power query.

33
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,770
I'm not going to go into that at the moment.

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,770
I'm not gonna go into Parkway because that needs a separate course by itself.

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,380
But this is our data here,

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,110
and it is in a tabular form.

37
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,160
I created a table out of it and let's create a pivot table.

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,400
Order that data and try to understand the data you can see here.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,920
We've got the year a year column,

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,510
and the province on the province basically includes the provinces and the territories in

41
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,090
Canada.

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,950
And there is the mother tongue,

43
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:15,440
Whether which what is the mother tongue of these people here living in that particular

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,450
province and in that particular year and the number of people having that particular mother

45
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,920
tongue in the particular province and year.

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,930
So I'm gonna insert a pivot table here,

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,940
insert a pivot table on.

48
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm gonna put it in the new worksheet.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,150
So here is our pivot table,

50
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,680
and now I'm gonna put the province year on the road section and I'm gonna put in the mother

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,630
tongue here on the column section,

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,030
and I'm gonna put the number of people here on the submission of value section,

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,210
and it's important as well to be able to slice that by the year.

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,330
I think that will give us a lot of information.

55
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,550
So if I right click here and add as slicer on the year,

56
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,010
I'll be able to create a year slicer.

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,840
And now you can see here we've got some numbers.

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,200
Well,

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,550
I can give these numbers a bit of formatting as well learned on our pivot table so I can go

60
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,600
to the pivot table,

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,570
analyze stab.

62
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,920
I'll go the select entire pivot table,

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,590
and then Argo the select again and then select the values on the pivot table.

64
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,920
So I selected only the values and now I can do some formatting.

65
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,570
So maybe I'll put a comma here on the numbers that you will be able to understand the

66
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,520
numbers better.

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,830
So,

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,470
for example,

69
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,430
this is 4,828,000 115 people.

70
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,150
This is 576,000 and 608 people on so on and so forth.

71
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,690
So this way a be able to read the numbers easier.

72
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,200
And now I could also because I've got these numbers here,

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,750
but it's actually better to express the numbers in terms of percentages.

74
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,860
And you'll see here how we would be able to do different ways of expressing numbers

75
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,730
percentages to,

76
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,050
and we will actually get different conclusions off the data when doing that.

77
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,430
So numbers by themselves are OK,

78
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,480
but you be even able to understand them better if you convert these numbers to percentage

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,420
is this is one of the easiest ways to understand your numbers.

80
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,690
So I'm actually gonna go here to my values.

81
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm gonna click on it,

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,590
and then I'm gonna go to value field settings,

83
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,760
and then I'm gonna go to show values as and here instead of the no calculation,

84
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,900
let's do a percentage of grand total and see what we get out of that.

85
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,950
So a press Okay,

86
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,960
Here and as you can see her to be able understand these numbers.

87
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:48,040
So basically these numbers say that 7.53% off the people who live in Canada and that's over

88
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,150
all over all the years.

89
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,240
So maybe I'll select a year here to be more specific about a certain years that here says

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,540
8.73% off the population off Canada.

91
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,460
They speak English,

92
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,530
and they live in Alberta.

93
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,440
So this is what the number meats.

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,760
And it says,

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,470
for example,

96
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:19,350
that 26.11% off the population in Canada speak English and live on in Ontario.

97
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,350
Okay,

98
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,250
so this is what these numbers mean,

99
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,840
But I can actually copy this pivot table.

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm gonna paste it here,

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,660
and I can change the calculation method so I can go to a new pivot table here,

102
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,120
go to submission of values,

103
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,460
value,

104
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,750
fields,

105
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,420
settings.

106
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,100
Ah,

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,700
goaless show values as.

108
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,070
And then I'll change that to percentage of column tall Toto,

109
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,330
Let's try the percentage of column tota and see what we get here.

110
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,090
So a press.

111
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,480
Okay.

112
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,800
Here.

113
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,740
So what does that mean?

114
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,810
So here you can see here that the column totals toe 100% this way.

115
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,010
So this is 100%.

116
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,580
This is 100%.

117
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,450
This is 100%.

118
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,020
So all these numbers here are 100% right?

119
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,990
So what do these numbers mean here?

120
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,250
It means that 15.32% for example,

121
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,730
off the people who speak English,

122
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,250
they live in Alberta.

123
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,460
Okay,

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:26,310
so here it's not expressing the number of people as the percentage of the Canadian

125
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,270
population as a whole is actually expressing them here.

126
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,560
It's a percentage of column,

127
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,080
Toto.

128
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,260
So here the column says English,

129
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,580
Right?

130
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,640
So it's expressing people in as percentages of the column total,

131
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,450
which in this case,

132
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,490
this column is English.

133
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,650
So it's expressing them as a percentage of English speakers and hear This column is French

134
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:46,650
,

135
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,130
so it's expressing them in the the percentage of French speakers you can see here,

136
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:59,670
45.79% of the people who have their mother tongue as English in Canada.

137
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,640
They reside in Ontario.

138
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,390
And here,

139
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,870
of course,

140
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:10,700
in Quebec you'll see the 86% of the people who have French as their mother tongue.

141
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,370
They reside in Quebec.

142
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,360
Which makes sense,

143
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,740
of course,

144
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,410
because Quebec has the highest population of people who speak French as their native

145
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,710
language or as there mother tongue in Canada,

146
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,260
of course.

147
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,280
And you know,

148
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,420
it makes sense here in Ontario because Ontario has actually the greatest population in

149
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,700
Canada.

150
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,580
The greatest population in Canada resides in Ontario.

151
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,520
Okay,

152
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,050
and most of them speak English.

153
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,070
So this is what the numbers mean in this case,

154
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,150
after we've done a percentage off column total.

155
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,200
Now,

156
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:52,640
I can also copy this pivot table and let's do a percentage of roe total on see what we get

157
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,100
out of these numbers here.

158
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,320
So when you do the percentage of Roe total,

159
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,240
it will give you the percentage of people who have a particular language spoken as their

160
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,860
mother tongue in any province.

161
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,390
So it is here that 75% off the people who live in Alberta,

162
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,980
they speak English as their mother tongue.

163
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,410
And 22 percent of these people,

164
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,990
they have other languages as their mother tongue.

165
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,200
So you can see here with three different options.

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,310
We got three different views and we can look at our data from three different perspectives

167
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,310
,

168
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,850
right?

169
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,250
So this is actually how powerful pivot tables are.

170
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,930
We managed to look at our data from three different perspectives and draw insights from our

171
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,370
data.

172
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,170
Now,

173
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,900
as a best practice,

174
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,030
what we can do as well is name these pivot tables here.

175
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,570
So I'm going to go to the pivot table in ally staff for the first pivot table here.

176
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,530
So I'm gonna name it PVT Percentage population overall.

177
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,770
And here I'm just gonna name it the percentage of population.

178
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,450
Ah,

179
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,280
by language.

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,340
So PVT percentage pop by length,

181
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,060
which Okay,

182
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:22,070
and here I'm just gonna name it PVT percentage pulp by province.

183
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,590
Okay,

184
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,970
so now we have three different pivot tables with three different names.

185
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,980
And let's make sure our slicer is connected to all the pivot tables year.

186
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,240
So I'm gonna go to report connections and you can see her are slicer is actually connected

187
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
to all three to the tables.

188
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,240
And when we change the year on our slicer,

189
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,750
we get the different percentages for all three pivot tables
