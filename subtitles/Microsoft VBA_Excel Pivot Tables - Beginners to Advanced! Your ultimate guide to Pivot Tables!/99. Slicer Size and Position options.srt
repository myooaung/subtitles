1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
Now we're going to speak about the settings for moving or resizing are slicer.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,240
So if you work,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,000
click here on a slicer and they go to size and properties.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,760
You will see here some options for formatting the size and position of the site,

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:14,950
sir,

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,680
so you could change the height here or the width using these options.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,890
Or you could also scale the height and the width.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,650
And you could also lock the aspect ratio so that when you change one,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,650
the other one changes as well.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,390
And here on their properties,

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,410
you could move un size with cells.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,150
So that means that if you change the site of the cells,

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,950
your slicer would move and get resized accordingly.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,570
Or here you could move but do not size with cells.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,380
So here,

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,180
when he changed the size with cells,

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,070
the slicer would only move,

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,050
but it would not get resized.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,300
Or you can choose not to move or size with cells so that when you change the side of the

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,810
cells,

21
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,060
your social does not get affected at all,

22
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,630
and you could choose to print it when you do a print and you could choose to lock your

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:06,990
slicer and looking your slicer means that unlocking your slicer means that it does not get

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,810
affected whatsoever when you protect your sheet.

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,430
So this option here does not work,

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,130
except when you protect your sheet.

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,090
When you click on your slicer as well here and then go to slice a tab,

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,760
you will see some more options here,

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,230
so there is the option to have multiple columns on your slicer.

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,620
So,

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,280
for example,

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,640
I will select this slicer here of the sales persons,

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,480
and I'll increase the number of columns so that I would have multiple columns here.

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,990
I would have My name's basically distributed on multiple columns,

35
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,150
and you could also change the height and the width here using these dial up buttons.

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,270
And you could also align your slicer.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,910
So you've got some alignment options year where you can align your slicers with each other

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,720
here,

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,180
and it's basically the same alignment options that are available in Excel for any object so

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,480
you could align the middle of the two slices,

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,010
for example.

42
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,450
So now the product and the reason slices are aligned,

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,340
their middles are aligned,

44
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,200
as you can see here.

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:17,340
So you've got your usual Align end grouping options year that are available for pretty much

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,750
any object in Excel.

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,980
Okay,

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,670
so that's it,

49
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,120
guys,

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,810
for the slicer size and position options.

51
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,210
Thank you so much watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
