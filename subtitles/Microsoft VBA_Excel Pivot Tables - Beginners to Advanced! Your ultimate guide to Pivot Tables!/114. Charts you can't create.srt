1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
Okay,

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,040
So let me tell you that pivot charts have some limitations,

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,470
actually,

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,270
and one of the limitations is that you can't create every kind of chart that you're

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,210
normally able to create using a pivot chart.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,790
So pivot charts are limited in that sense.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,000
So,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,670
for example,

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,150
here,

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,340
all my pivot table,

11
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,380
I'm going to go to the insert tab on the ribbon.

12
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,080
And then there is a new kind of chart that's been added to Excel,

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,390
which is a treatment chart,

14
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,380
but you can't create a pivot chart out of that chart.

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,950
You also cannot create a scatter chart out of a pivot chart.

16
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,960
You also cannot create a map chart out of a pivot chart.

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,230
And if I also go to the recommended charts here,

18
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,420
there are some other chart types that you can't create.

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,040
So the hissed a gram you can see here there's no option to press okay,

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,070
and the box and whisker as well.

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,970
There is no option and the waterfall chart.

22
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,650
There's no option to do that and the funnel chart as well.

23
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,180
So all these shorts you cannot create using a pivot chart,

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,200
and I believe the stock chart as well.

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,250
You can't create a stock chart using a pivot chart,

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,950
and you can't create a sunburst chart as well.

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,860
So just be aware of that.

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,060
Pivot charts have some limitations.

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,380
You cannot create all kinds of charts using pivot charts.
