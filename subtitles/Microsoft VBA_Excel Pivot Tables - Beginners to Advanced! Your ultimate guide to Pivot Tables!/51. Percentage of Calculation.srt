1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
in this video,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,190
we're going to explain the percentage off calculation in pivot tables,

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:13,080
so the percentage off calculation displays the value of one item as a percentage of another

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,590
item.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:13,950
Okay,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,630
so let's take an example for that.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,860
So I've got a pivot table here that shows the sales on each year here for each region.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:30,310
And let's say I want to display the sales of each year as a percentage of the previous year

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,310
.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,820
So I want to see the percentage of 2017 sales from the sales off 2016 for example.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,330
And if there had been a 2018 year here on my data,

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,550
then I'll be able to display the percentage of the sales in 2018 from the sales in 2017.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,760
You get the idea.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,580
So to do that,

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,710
I'm gonna insert another field here for the sales amount so that I can edit that field to

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,740
display the sales as a percentage of the previous year.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,680
So I've got this sum of sales amount to I'm gonna click on it,

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,440
go to value field settings here,

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,380
and then go to show values as on then for the show values as instead of no calculation,

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,190
I'm gonna select percentage off and they want to display the percentage of the previous

21
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,500
years.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,710
I'm going to go to the year field here and then I'm going to select previous and then I'm

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,300
going to rename it so I can rename it percentage of previous year and then I'm gonna click

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,300
.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,830
Okay,

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,790
here and now.

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,690
As you can see here,

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,190
I can see the percentage of the sales from the PVC ear off course because 2016 is the

29
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,990
earliest year on my data.

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,990
There isn't a year previous to that,

31
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,530
so it's showing 100% because we're getting the percentage of the sales of 2016 from the

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,800
sales of 2016 which would deal the 100%.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,650
But here in 2017 I get the percentage of sales for 2017 from 2016.

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:06,460
So basically saying here that the sales for 2017 war 65 points 69% off the sales in 2016

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,570
you could also get the sales off a certain item as well.

36
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,880
So I'm going to go here to the stop percentage of product one.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,540
So let's say we want to get the percentage of the sales for each product as measured from

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,310
product one.

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,620
So I want to display the percentage of the sales for product to as a percentage of the

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,310
sales for product one and percentage of the sales were product three as a percentage of

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,220
product one and so on and so forth.

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,380
Let's say that product one is our main product and we wanna get the percentage of sales for

43
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,480
each product with respect to product one.

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,820
So we can do that as well.

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,860
We're gonna insert another field here from the sales amount,

46
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,260
and then we're going to click on it,

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,680
go to value field settings,

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
go to show values as and then percentage of,

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,390
and we're going to select here.

50
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,350
The base field is going to be our product name.

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,470
So this is the field we're gonna base our sales on.

52
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,660
And then we're going to select here Product one.

53
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,250
So this field here is gonna be named percentage of product one sales,

54
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,240
and we're gonna click OK here.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,600
And as you can see here,

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,700
this shows us the percentage of sales with respect to product one.

57
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,570
So here,

58
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,440
because product who has sold more than product one is showing more than 100% here on 2016.

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,720
So that means that product to was 124 percent 0.65 of product one.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,630
This means it sold about 25% more than product one.

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,550
And this is the case for product three and for product for as well.

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,150
It shows the sales as a percentage off product one.

63
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,530
Okay,

64
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,380
so this is how you can do the percentage of calculation in pivot tables.
