1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
and this video,

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,660
we're going to see how we can create a percentage of grand,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,210
total calculated field in our pivot table.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,500
So we're able to insert a calculated field on the submission of Value section that would

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,760
calculate the percentage of each of the values in our pivot table from the grand total

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,370
value here that has red borders on the bottom,

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,930
right corner of our pivot table.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,350
So to do that,

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,870
what we need to do is to insert another field here on the submission of Value section.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,570
But we're going to click on it and then go to value field settings and then go to show

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,840
values as and then instead of no calculation or gonna select percentage of grand total.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,340
And we can change its name as well.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,000
2% of grand total and we can click OK here.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,150
And as you can see here,

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:51,160
we were able to insert a calculated field that calculates the percentage of grand total for

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,890
each value on our pivot table.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,200
So basically this value is 9.9% from the grand total value.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,290
And actually,

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,170
if we some the individual values here across the columns,

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,720
for example,

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,390
so if you some this value and this value you will see here that there summation is 15.61%

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,230
of the grand total,

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,810
which is basically the percentage of this sub total here from the grand total.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:26,800
So this subtitle 1,266,446 is 15.61% off this grand total.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,290
So basically this percentage of grant a little would insert a calculated field that would

26
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,530
indicate the percentage of each item over pivot table from the grand total.
