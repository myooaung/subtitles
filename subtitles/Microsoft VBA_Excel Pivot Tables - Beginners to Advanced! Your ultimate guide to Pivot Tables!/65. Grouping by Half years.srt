00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
this video.

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,820
We're going to see how we congrats by half years.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,770
So as you can see here,

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,140
I've got my pivot table and I've got the sales month on the road section and I've got the

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,930
summation of value section here having this sales amount.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,960
And let's say I want to grew by half year.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,550
That is,

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,760
I want to put the 1st 6 months of the year in a group and then the 2nd 6 months of the year

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,100
in another group.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,370
So to do that,

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm just going to select my 1st 6 months right click and then click on group here.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
And if you consider they've been put in a group called Group One,

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,880
I can change its name here.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,620
So I'm gonna name it first half,

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,470
for example.

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,720
And then I can select the second group of months here the last six months of the year,

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,090
Right Click group and said that group,

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,430
too,

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,510
And then name it second half.

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,660
And now I have two groups and I can see the totals here for Group one.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,830
So for the 1st 6 months and then the total for the 2nd 6 months,

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,470
or the for the lost six months,

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,860
and here you can see here it's a field that is only in the pivot table cash.

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,830
It's called sales month to I can remove the sales month and it could see the first half and

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,380
second half.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,070
If I need to change the name,

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,560
I can click on it,

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,610
go to field settings and then I can rename it Year Half,

29
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,060
for example and click.

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,740
OK,

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,910
so now I've been able to group my data by first half and second half.

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,480
And if I need to own group my data,

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,640
I can select my group's year right click and then UN group to UN group my data.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,630
I'm gonna press control and Z here to go back to my groupings.

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,590
So that's it,

36
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,370
guys on how to group by half years.
