1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
and this video,

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,600
we're going to speak about filtering values in pivot tables.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,350
Cizikas here.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,530
We've got a pivot table here.

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,090
We got the order date on the road section and some sails around on the submission of value

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,550
section.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,930
And here we can filter the values on the submission of sales amounts.

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,450
So if you press here too,

9
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,010
go to our filters and then go to value filters.

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,550
And as you can see here,

11
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:27,150
we've got equals is not equal to greater than greater than equal to less than less than or

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,490
equal to between,

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,930
not between and top.

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,610
Then So,

15
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,140
for example,

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,870
we could do greater than 100,000.

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,220
So we'll see the days when we had orders that were greater than ah,

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,410
100,000 Click.

19
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,730
OK,

20
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,180
here you can see here we get the days where we had sales greater than 100,000.

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,760
We could do as well less than so less than 30,000 for example.

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,500
So these are the days where we had less than 30,000 and we consort,

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,990
of course,

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,890
after doing the filter so we consort smallest to largest,

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,850
largest to smallest.

26
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,850
Any gun to sort that we would like we could also do between and not between.

27
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:12,050
So between 50,000 for example and 100,000 press.

28
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,340
Okay,

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:12,580
here.

30
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,160
So these air the orders between 50,000 and 100,000.

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,640
Now,

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,450
on the next video,

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,660
we're gonna discuss the top 10 option.
