1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310
Okay,

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,580
guys.

3
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,300
So now let's have another case study for using pivot tables to drive insights from a data

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,650
set.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,740
So here,

6
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,000
I've got a data set that I got from stats Canada.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,380
It's for the employees by industry.

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,060
So it shows here what the number of employees are in a particular industry in a particular

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,380
Canadian province or territory,

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,520
and by the type of employees as well,

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,690
it breaks him down by the type of the employees.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,810
Okay,

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,350
so we're going to study the that data set and see what we can get out of it.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,720
Okay,

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,220
guys.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,770
So first of all,

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,830
the first step is to create a table out of our data set.

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,840
So I'm gonna go here to insert a table,

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,650
and I'm gonna insert a table on my data set,

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,350
and I'm gonna coldest TVL data.

21
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,770
Now,

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,980
I've created a table out of my data set and you'll notice here that we've got some rose on

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,280
the number of people call him that don't have any values.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,690
That does not necessarily mean that the value is zero here.

25
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,310
For the number of people working in that particular industry,

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,350
it could also mean that they couldn't get any statistics on the number of people working in

27
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,990
that particular industry under that particular type of employees and in that particular

28
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,250
province and year,

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,410
so it doesn't necessarily mean it.

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,070
Zero It could be a zero,

31
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,720
or could be that we don't have enough information to get statistics about the number of

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,380
people there,

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,170
so you could either leave it as it is.

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,450
And the pivot table is actually gonna consider that a zero in all its calculations when

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,440
adding so it won't make a difference.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,260
Or you can replace the values by zero if that's what you want to do.

37
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,550
So it's really up to you.

38
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,410
I'm just gonna leave it as it is for now.

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,770
And it would be a good idea to give some number formatting for the number of people column

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:57,770
.

41
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,090
So I'm just going to select the whole column here by pressing control,

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,080
shift and end,

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,650
and this will select the whole column.

44
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,820
And then I'm just gonna click here to give it a common style so that reading numbers would

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,020
be easier this way,

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,880
and I'll also give it no decimal places.

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,560
It would be zero decimal places by decreasing the decimals all the way to zero because this

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,510
is a number of people,

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,910
so we don't need decimals.

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,160
So that's something that I could do for my numbers to make every new breeding my numbers

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,690
easier.

52
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,080
And now I'm going to create a pivot table out of my data.

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,600
So I'm gonna go to insert a pivot table here,

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,730
and I'm going to click on OK,

55
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,780
here to insert it in the new worksheets.

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm gonna insert my pivot table in and you worksheet and let's give this new worksheet a

57
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,150
name here.

58
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,070
Prevette and I'm also going to give my pivot table and name here,

59
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,190
So I'm gonna go to Pivot Table,

60
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,110
analyze year and give it a name,

61
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,690
maybe PVT employees by industry.

62
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,500
Okay,

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,550
so I gave my pivot table and name here,

64
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,790
and I'll put my province or territory here on the road section.

65
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,460
Also put the industry under it as well on the road section.

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,410
So you can see here it's the province or territory,

67
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,590
and then the industry,

68
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,210
and I'm gonna put the number of people here on the value section here,

69
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,170
and I'm gonna insert here a couple of rose above my pivot tables so as to allow some space

70
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,250
for some slicers I'm gonna add on top of it.

71
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,750
And I'm also going to remove here the grid lines because this makes Molly spreadsheet look

72
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,060
cleaner and,

73
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,540
um,

74
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,250
gonna put a slicer here for the year.

75
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,920
So right,

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,960
click and then add as a slicer.

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:53,210
Or you could also go toe insert and then slicer here and then select the year and here you

78
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,620
can see here.

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,120
I've got four years here,

80
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,000
and I'm gonna actually make my slicer have four columns us to be spread here horizontally

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,550
like this.

82
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,520
This would make it fit in that space better.

83
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,280
And I'm also gonna insert another slicer here for the type of employees.

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,920
So right,

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,030
click and then add as a slicer.

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,700
Or you could also go to insert and then slicer and select the employee type.

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,790
And I'm gonna make this two columns here,

88
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:30,130
and I'm just gonna put the slicer here at the top and also here for the number of people on

89
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,120
my values column here.

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,970
I could give this some number formatting so I can go to here to the pivot table,

91
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,930
Analyze stab.

92
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,740
I'll go to select entire pivot table and then I'll go to select again and then alc select

93
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,510
my values here.

94
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,940
And then I'm just going to give it here,

95
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,240
this number formatting here so as to make reading the numbers easier or I go.

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,250
So let's start getting some information from our data set after would build our pivot table

97
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,250
.

98
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,590
So first of all,

99
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,660
let's select a year here and let's select a type of employees,

100
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,000
for example to say the hourly employees.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,450
And then let's actually change the calculation here on the some of number of people.

102
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,410
I'm just going to click here on that field on the values section and then click on value

103
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,320
field settings.

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,510
I'm gonna click on show values as and I'm gonna go here 2% of parent row Toto,

105
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:32,350
because this will give me the percentage of the parent row for each rose to the parent row

106
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,600
here,

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,120
for example,

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,310
for the industry is actually the province,

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,730
so he will give me the percentage of the number of people in a province here for each

110
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,300
industry,

111
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,790
so ah,

112
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,920
click OK here.

113
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:53,340
So what this means here at the moment is that 11.66% of the total number of employees that

114
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,160
are hourly employees in Canada in 2016 are in Alberta on then for each industry here under

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,660
a Berta,

116
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,460
it's actually the percentage out of the 11.66%.

117
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,350
Okay,

118
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,140
so this year is giving me the percentage apparent row.

119
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,560
The parent row for the industry is the province,

120
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,650
and the parent row for the province is actually the grand total,

121
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,490
which is the whole off Canada.

122
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,430
Okay,

123
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,880
so we can actually take a quick helicopter view here.

124
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,960
Taken a quick overall view about the breakdown of off the number of employees in Canada.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,580
So what province,

126
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,980
for example has the highest number of employees?

127
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,380
We can do that easily by right clicking here on a province,

128
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,850
and then we can go to expanding collapse,

129
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,020
and then we can actually collapsed the entire field.

130
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,720
If we collapse the entire field,

131
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,430
it will quickly here collapse all the fields.

132
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:56,900
So this means that it's gonna un expand the provinces which have all the industries under

133
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,080
it.

134
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,100
We're just gonna just un expanding that we're doing that quickly for all the provinces.

135
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,550
So us to no.

136
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,720
Which province has the most number,

137
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,890
employees and it's clear it is Ontario because here in Ontario has almost 40% off the

138
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,310
number off employees in Canada here,

139
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,600
so across most of the years,

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,880
and actually they are always hovering.

141
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,010
Around 40% of 40% of the employees in Canada reside in Ontario,

142
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,510
whether their hourly employees or salaried employees inside employees or even more,

143
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,950
they are approaching now.

144
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,560
Ah,

145
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
spare the latest data.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
They're approaching 45%.

147
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,810
So most of the employees in Canada or in Ontario,

148
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,650
which makes sense because Ontario is actually the most populated,

149
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,650
the most densely populated province in Canada.

150
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,280
Right?

151
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,910
So that's Ah,

152
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,610
quick insight that we can get out of our data and we can actually click here on the plus

153
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:03,550
next to Interior to know what is the most industry that people work at by your own.

154
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,010
Uh,

155
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,620
I've sorted that already.

156
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,540
So I've started in a descending order.

157
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,170
But if it doesn't show like that for you can right click and sort and sort largest to

158
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,040
smallest here.

159
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,760
So you can see here that it's already sorted here in descending order,

160
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,340
and you can see here that the most industries is thean industrial aggregate,

161
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,990
excluding unclassified businesses and service producing industries and educational services

162
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:26,990
.

163
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,670
These air the top three industries.

164
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:35,440
So there are a lot of universities in Ontario on people come to study in Ontario.

165
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,610
So that is actually a significant portion here of the employees of Ontario here for

166
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,750
salaried employees.

167
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,320
Ah,

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,670
for hourly employees,

169
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,680
it's a bit different.

170
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,570
So it's Industri aggregate and service producing industries,

171
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,970
but but a different percentage.

172
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,950
And then there's goods producing industries as well.

173
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,450
So as you can see here,

174
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,170
the the industries they change whether you choose Arlie employees or salaried employees,

175
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,010
let's check.

176
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,580
Actually,

177
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,210
a province like Noona VAT,

178
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,150
which is a bit of,

179
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,350
ah,

180
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,490
remote provinces,

181
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,380
a remote area.

182
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,050
It's far up north in Canada,

183
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,910
and it doesn't have a large population.

184
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:22,120
It only has about 36,000 people living in it and is you can hear the most.

185
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,980
Industries is service producing industries and service producing industries include the

186
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,610
banking and the finance and,

187
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:29,940
ah,

188
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,010
the insurance industries.

189
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,980
So there's not much.

190
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,520
They're not much production or anything.

191
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,950
It's just the industries that people where people can do like office jobs,

192
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,430
or so,

193
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,390
as you can see here and there is accommodation and Food services,

194
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,360
which is basically the hospitality industry,

195
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,670
like the restaurants and the hotels.

196
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,230
And that's pretty much it.

197
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,670
So,

198
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,490
ah,

199
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,380
most off the economy of ah.

200
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,810
None of it is just dependent on service industries and accommodation and food services.

201
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:08,270
This is something this is an insight that you can get out of this data set,

202
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,430
and that makes sense because it's a very,

203
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,060
very cold area.

204
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,930
So,

205
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,480
uh,

206
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,710
people rarely go out about.

207
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:25,070
So it makes sense that most of the industry's air indoor jobs and not much of outdoor jobs

208
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,900
so you can see her.

209
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,120
The Nunavut has mostly the service producing industries and the accommodation and food

210
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,770
services.

211
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,150
These are the main industries that people work at.

212
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,490
And,

213
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,050
by the way,

214
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,250
the fact that the other industries are zeros doesn't mean necessarily that there are no

215
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,020
people working in these industries.

216
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,170
It could mean that there was no data available,

217
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,890
which is weird,

218
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,190
actually,

219
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,320
because stats can and should be able to the pain data for that,

220
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,490
it's it's May.

221
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,940
It's their main focus.

222
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,380
But sometimes there might not be enough data or so for for the other industries,

223
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,460
so that doesn't necessarily mean that there are no people working in the other industries.

224
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,410
It might mean that there's no accurate data for that.

225
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:07,910
Alright,

226
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,160
guys.

227
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,200
So this was a quick exploration off this data set,

228
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,890
and you will have some sort of exercise or home work to do on this data set.

229
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,950
I'll give you some questions too.

230
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,340
Answer about this data set.

231
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,730
So hope you found the video helpful,

232
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,300
and I'll see you on the next one.
