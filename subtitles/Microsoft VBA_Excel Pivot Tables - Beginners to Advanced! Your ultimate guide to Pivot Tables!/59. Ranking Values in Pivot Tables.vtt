00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.160
Hey,

2
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.410
guys,

3
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.010
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.860
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.340
we're going to see how we can insert a rank in pivot tables so we'll see how we can rank

6
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.650
our values in ascending order.

7
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.590
So that smallest to largest or in descending order.

8
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.580
So its largest to smallest.

9
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.010
So here we've got a pivot table where we have our sales persons and we have their sales

10
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.330
amount.

11
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.140
And let's say we want to rank these sales persons according to their sales amounts,

12
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.970
whether in ascending order or descending order.

13
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.930
So we can insert actually another instance here of the sales amount into our summation of

14
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.710
value section.

15
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.740
We're going to click on it,

16
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.560
go to value field settings and then go to show values as and then here we're gonna choose

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.650
on the drop down menu.

18
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.380
We're going to choose rank smallest to largest,

19
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.940
for example.

20
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.770
So this were rank from the smallest value to the largest value,

21
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.960
so the smallest value would take a value of one,

22
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.750
and then largest value will take the largest value basically,

23
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.280
and then the base field here,

24
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.490
the field that we want a base,

25
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.250
our ranking on is gonna be the sales person because we want to rank the values for outside

26
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.720
its persons and then we're going to give it a custom name here.

27
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.480
So rank smallest two largest and then we're going to click.

28
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.060
OK,

29
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.050
so is it cause here it's given us some numbers year,

30
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.370
which are rankings.

31
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.990
However,

32
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.900
we just need to change the number formatting instead of currency.

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230
We're just gonna make it a normal number here.

34
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.420
And as you can see here,

35
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.770
the smallest value takes the value of one on.

36
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.460
Then the second smallest takes a value of two for the rank here and then third smallest

37
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.580
takes a value three.

38
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.040
And that's actually sort our values here in ascending order,

39
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.910
just to be able to see them easier,

40
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.070
says he consider our values here are given ranks according to the order,

41
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.470
with the smallest being given number of one and then the largest being given the largest

42
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.760
number,

43
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.200
which is basically the count of the values here,

44
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.520
which is in our case,

45
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.190
10

46
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.280
We can also do a rank largest to smallest,

47
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.720
so the largest value is going to take the rank number one and then the smallest value is

48
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.120
gonna take the rank number 10 in this particular case,

49
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.230
which would be useful here because we might need to point out the sales person who has the

50
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.510
highest sales.

51
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.480
So let's do that.

52
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.680
We're gonna insert another instance here for the sales amount.

53
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.940
We're going to click on it,

54
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.810
go to value feel settings and then go to show values as.

55
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.150
And then we're gonna select rank largest to smallest.

56
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.880
And we're gonna selector based fields here to be the sales person We're going to do a

57
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.810
custom name here,

58
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.660
rang largest to smallest,

59
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.050
and we're going to click OK,

60
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.360
here.

61
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.110
And it's being given the incorrect number formatting.

62
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.280
So we're going to correct the number formatting here to be just a number.

63
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.170
And as you can see here we have our rank here,

64
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.200
largest to smallest to largest value here takes the value of one.

65
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.680
Here,

66
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.540
Madeline has the highest sales.

67
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.310
She takes a value of one and then smallest value.

68
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.970
Bob.

69
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.250
He takes the value off 10.

70
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.890
So it's a simple ranking of your values.

71
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.400
So that's it,

72
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.780
guys,

73
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.390
for inserting a rank on your values and pivot tables.

74
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.250
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one
