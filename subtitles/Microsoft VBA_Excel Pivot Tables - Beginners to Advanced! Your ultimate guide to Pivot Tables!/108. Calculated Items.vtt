00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Now we're going to speak about calculated items.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.910
So we've explained before the calculated fields.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:14.810
The calculated fields are fields that we create to make calculations using one or more off

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.170
the fields that we have on our pivot tables.

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.800
And the fields are basically the columns that we have in our pivot tables.

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.390
Right,

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.010
However,

8
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.180
calculated items make calculations using the items.

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.500
So what's the difference between a field on an item?

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.090
A field is basically your column,

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.750
but an item is basically the records on your column.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.860
So,

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.710
for example,

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.640
the sales month is a field.

15
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.610
But the individual months under it are the items off that field.

16
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.710
So January February marsh until December,

17
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.530
they are the items under the sales month field.

18
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.030
OK,

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.250
so that's the difference between a field and an item.

20
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.750
So for calculated items,

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.060
instead of making calculations using the whole column,

22
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.530
we're gonna make calculations using items under the column.

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.730
So,

24
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.310
for example,

25
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.820
we can make a calculation.

26
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.410
For example,

27
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.180
that is the first half of the year.

28
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.080
So maybe you want to calculate the sales on the first half of the year using the months

29
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.820
from January to June,

30
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.640
for example,

31
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.720
so we can do that.

32
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.000
So that strike to do that.

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.200
But first of all,

34
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.270
you need to know that in order to create calculations,

35
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.210
uncalculated items,

36
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.410
you need to be selecting the item itself.

37
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.340
Like if you select the number here and then go to pivot table,

38
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.300
analyze and then golden fields,

39
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.180
items and sets,

40
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.870
he could see her.

41
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.250
The option of a calculated item is not there.

42
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.730
So you need to be selecting the item itself that you need to make calculations on.

43
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.620
You can see here we have the option for a calculated item.

44
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.180
Okay,

45
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.850
so you need to be selecting an item under the field that you need to make.

46
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.740
Calculations are.

47
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.520
Okay,

48
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.430
so let's go here it feels items and sets calculated item,

49
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.360
and then I'll create a calculated item called H one and that each one is basically gonna be

50
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.600
sells for January plus February plus Marsh.

51
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.060
It was April plus May plus June,

52
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.870
for example.

53
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.310
This the sales in the first half of the year,

54
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.750
and I'll add that.

55
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.710
Okay,

56
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.150
so now we have the item added to our calculated items.

57
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.030
We could also do the second half of the year as well.

58
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.640
So we can do like July till December before now I'm just going to do the first half of the

59
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.790
year and then I'll click.

60
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.220
OK,

61
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.610
here.

62
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.040
And as you can see here we have a calculated item That is basically the summation off the

63
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.800
months off the first half of the year.

64
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.180
So,

65
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.710
as you can see here,

66
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:56.750
this number 1,499,564 is the summation of old These numbers,

67
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.420
As you can see here,

68
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.750
it's the same submission.

69
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.510
However,

70
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.080
let's try to add the grand totals to this pivot table.

71
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.670
So I'm gonna go to the design grand totals,

72
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.280
and I'm just gonna put it on for rows and columns.

73
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.460
So,

74
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.250
as you can see here,

75
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.310
this calculated item has been added to the grand total as well.

76
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.260
So this is why I don't use calculated items often because you're you're asking for trouble

77
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.960
right away.

78
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.810
If you're trying to use a calculated item because,

79
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.390
as you can see here,

80
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.850
it's been added to the total.

81
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.650
Okay,

82
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.560
so it's quite dangerous,

83
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.110
actually to use them because you end up having incorrect numbers because,

84
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.500
you know,

85
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.480
this first half of the year should not be calculated twice.

86
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.820
Right?

87
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.070
If you check here,

88
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.790
this total is 4,453,167 which is the same as this one.

89
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.460
So H one has been added to the whole grand total.

90
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.210
And that's dangerous.

91
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.960
OK,

92
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.520
this is why you don't use them.

93
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.450
Instead,

94
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.640
what I would do is I would go to my data,

95
00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.190
for example,

96
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.460
and create a column that would be the first half of the year.

97
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.930
H one and I would create the column using a formula on,

98
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.650
then out make calculations based on that column.

99
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.650
And there's actually another work around that you can do,

100
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.160
which is that you can,

101
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.980
for example,

102
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.230
select the months from January till June and then right click on them and then group these

103
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.900
months here,

104
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.640
Okay?

105
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.890
And now you can name this group.

106
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.270
You can name it of H one or first half of the You already have a cookies item so named H

107
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.440
one.

108
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.350
So I'm gonna name it first half,

109
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.070
for example,

110
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.570
because we already have something here called each one,

111
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.830
so it's not gonna accept it from us.

112
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.060
So,

113
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.310
as you can see here Now we have a calculated item called the first half.

114
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.980
Or we could name H one or whatever and let's actually remove the calculated item that is

115
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.750
called H one.

116
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.680
So I'm just going to select one of the items year,

117
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.050
go to calculated item,

118
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.110
and then I'm going to select the H one.

119
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.260
I'm gonna delete that.

120
00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.820
I'm gonna click,

121
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.280
OK,

122
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.350
here and then I can name this H one.

123
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.010
So as you can see her now,

124
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.250
we have the same effect.

125
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.810
We've grouped the months for the first half of the year as h one and we have correct

126
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.430
numbers here.

127
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.730
So,

128
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.240
as you consider,

129
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.340
the total sales for the year is 2,953,603 which is the correct total for the whole year.

130
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.010
And we can also go ahead and group the second half of the year as h two as well.

131
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:37.530
So we can actually group thes into a second group and call that H two and we're set and we

132
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.470
have the same effect here.

133
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.340
We have basically created and calculated item through grouping,

134
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.140
and now we have the correct grand total as well.

135
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.160
So I wouldn't recommend that you'd use calculated items,

136
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.600
often because they are quite dangerous.

137
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.230
Instead,

138
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.280
it's better to do these work arounds,

139
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.610
you know,

140
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.440
to group your items or to create new categories on your data on your raw data and do

141
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.110
calculated field calculations instead of calculated items.

142
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.950
So I'm just mentioning them to you for the sake of being comprehensive on the course so as

143
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.950
to cover that part.

144
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.950
But I myself,

145
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.610
I'm not a fan of calculated items.
