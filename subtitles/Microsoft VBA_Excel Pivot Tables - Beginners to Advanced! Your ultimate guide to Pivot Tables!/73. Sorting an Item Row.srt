1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
another way of sorting is sorting an item role from left to right.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,020
So here we've got a pivot table where I have the product name here on the road section.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,590
We've got the year on the columns section and we've got the summer sales amount on the

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,370
submission of Value Section and let's say when a sort the pivot table from left to right

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,190
according to product four in a descending order.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:30,230
So what I want to do is to have the whole pivot table sorted in descending order according

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,430
to the submission of sales amounts in product for So if we do that and so it from left to

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,690
right in descending order,

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,940
we should expect the value for 2017 to come here on the left and then the value for 2016 to

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,330
go here on the right.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,140
And of course,

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,470
this will happen toe only other values.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:56,570
But everything is sorted in a left to right fashion in a descending order according to the

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,870
row for product for So let's see that in action.

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,290
If I right click here,

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,790
go to sort and then more sort options,

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,050
I'm going to sort largest to smallest and left to right.

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,150
So here,

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,770
as you can see her on the summary,

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,230
it says sort year by some of sales amount in descending order using values in this row.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,450
What is the role I'm going to sort on its product?

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:19,630
Four.

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,750
So it's the role on product for that is going to be the center of my sorting basically for

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,650
the whole pivot table.

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,060
Now let's click OK and see what happens here.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,140
As you can see here,

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:38,330
I sorted everything according to product four in a descending order left to right.

28
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,610
So as you can see her,

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:49,260
it moved 2017 to the left and 2016 to the right because of sorting on product four left to

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,570
right.

31
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,150
So this is how you consort according to UN items row
