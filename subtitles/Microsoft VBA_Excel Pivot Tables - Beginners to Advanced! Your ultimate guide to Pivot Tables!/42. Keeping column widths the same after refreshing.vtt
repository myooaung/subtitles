00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
As you can see here,

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.800
we've got a pivot table.

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.810
And if I changed the width of its columns and try to refresh the pivot table,

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.330
so right click and then re fresh because here that the width of the columns returns back to

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.020
what it was.

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.580
So to prevent that from happening,

7
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.050
we can right click on the pivot table and then go to pivot table options.

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.950
And then there is an option here.

9
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.200
There is so to fit column wits on update.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.300
So if we disable the option and press OK here and then we change the width of the columns

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.580
again and then right,

12
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.520
click and refresh because here that the columns have not returned to their with before we

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.850
change the with so you can see that the columns retained their with that we changed them to

14
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.850
.
