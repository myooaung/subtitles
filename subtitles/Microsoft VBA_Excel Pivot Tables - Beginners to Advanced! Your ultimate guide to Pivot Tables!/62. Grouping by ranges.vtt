Hey,

2
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.790
guys,

3
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.370
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.290
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.740
we're going to see how weaken Group by ranges in pivot tables.

6
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.410
So I've got my pivot table here,

7
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.350
and this time I'm actually gonna put the sales amount here in the rose section.

8
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.240
And as you can see here,

9
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.970
we get the amounts for our sales transactions year.

10
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.820
So these amounts are actually the amounts for our sales transactions here or the sales

11
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.280
amount that was in each row off our data.

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.710
We can actually group these amounts into bins or buckets.

13
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.740
And to do that,

14
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.060
we can right click,

15
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.090
go to group.

16
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.880
And as you can see here,

17
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.360
the amount here would be starting at the amount for the minimum sales amount or the minimum

18
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.320
amount for our transactions,

19
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.550
which is 20,259 and ending at the maximum amount for our transactions.

20
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.100
I can group these into bins or buckets off 10,000 if I click.

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.470
OK,

22
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.810
here.

23
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.450
You can see here they have been grouped into bins or buckets off 10,000.

24
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.070
Now,

25
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.130
if I drag here,

26
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.510
the sales amount into submission of Value section,

27
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
it would tell us how many transactions occurred in each bucket.

28
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.070
So it's basically telling us that there were 19 transactions that happened between 20,259

29
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.380
to $30,258.

30
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.980
Okay,

31
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.730
on then,

32
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.650
22 transactions between 30,259 and $40,258.

33
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890
And if you don't like these bins,

34
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.010
you can actually put bins of your own.

35
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.030
So if you right click,

36
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.150
go to group here,

37
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.380
I can make my bins,

38
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.910
for example.

39
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.770
Start from $10,000 up until ah,

40
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.940
$100,000 for example.

41
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.800
And with $10,000 increments If I click OK,

42
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.170
here,

43
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.290
you can see here I get my bins year between 20,000 to 100,000.

44
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.060
And I didn't get any bins on the $10,000 amounts because I did not have any transactions

45
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.230
between 10,000 and 20 thousands.

46
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.400
So this is why I don't have any results for the 10,000 to 20,000 bins.

47
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.090
But if I add like another row of data here,

48
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.220
if I just copy any raw data that I have,

49
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.950
just copy any row here and put the sales amount as 10,000 and just refresh my pivot table.

50
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.580
Because here I have this one transaction between 10,000 and 19,999.

51
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.950
So that's it,

52
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.370
guys.

53
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.340
For grouping by ranges in pivot tables.

54
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.690
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one.
