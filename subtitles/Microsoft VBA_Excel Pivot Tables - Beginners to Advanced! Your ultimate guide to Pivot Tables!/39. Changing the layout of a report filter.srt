00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
in this video,

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,350
we're going to see how we can change the filter layout in pivot tables says You can see

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,070
here we've got a pivot table here we get a product name on the Rose and the Year on the

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,370
Columns section and the submission of sales on the Submission Value section,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,110
and we get a bunch of filters year,

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,030
region sales,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,960
person quarter and sales month.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,440
And as you can see here,

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,210
the filters are in a single column,

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,980
but you can actually make them be in a single row or multiple worlds.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,510
And you can set a limit on how many filters appear per column or Perot so that if you said

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,530
a limited to,

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,300
for example,

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,490
than you'd have to filters in this column and then Excel would create another column for

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,570
the other two filters.

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,350
So we'll see how we can do that.

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,000
Basically,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,080
you can right click on any cell in your pivot table and then go to pivot table options here

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,080
,

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,970
and you can see here there is an option here,

21
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,280
display fuels and report filter area down than over,

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,390
so it's currently down.

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,560
Then over this means that they'll be stacked across columns like this.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,010
And then there is report filter fields per column,

25
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,460
so it's currently zero.

26
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,560
So that means it will put all the filters in one column.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,850
But let's say I'm gonna put a limit of two per column so we'll actually put each two

28
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,250
filters in a single column.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,040
So we get here full filters,

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,470
so we'll have to columns here.

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,270
So each two filters are in a column.

32
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,150
You can also right click here pivot table options and then the second option here instead

33
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,130
of down then over.

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,820
It's over.

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,990
Then down this will make them get Start the crossroads.

36
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,270
I'll switch to the zero option here in you can see here it's now,

37
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,400
report filter fields,

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,520
Perot instead of pair column.

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,500
So press Okay,

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,740
so zero is usually the default option to see what happens here.

41
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,230
You can see here that now the filters are spread here in a single row is against year.

42
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,560
They are all in a single rope.

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,180
Now,

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,470
if we go again to the pivot table options and then we can make it to Perot.

45
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,640
So we've got four filters,

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,580
so we're gonna have to rose with two filters,

47
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,610
each press OK you can see here we get to Rose and we've got to filters per each row.

48
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,880
So this is how you can change the pivot table filter,

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,420
Leo.
