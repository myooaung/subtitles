00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
in this video,

2
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.830
we're going to see how to automatically include new items in manual filters.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.740
Says you can see here.

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.940
I've got my pivot table.

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.250
We have the sales person on the road section and would get the summer sales amount on the

6
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.700
submission of Value Section.

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.200
As you can see her,

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.450
my sales person field is filtered for three salespeople Billy and Bob and Jamie.

9
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.360
Now let's say that I add in you sales person here to my data.

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.890
So I'm going to copy the loss rail here and add in you person here,

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.290
which is John Smith now in order to display John Smith Ice part of my filter.

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.530
I need,

13
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.450
first of all to refresh my pivot table,

14
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.330
right click on Refresh and then select John Smith here on the list because because here

15
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.160
it's appeared at the bottom click.

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.570
OK,

17
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.940
here,

18
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.650
and I'm able to add John Smith to my list.

19
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.620
But let's say that I want,

20
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.970
in case a new value is added.

21
00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.170
I wanted to be added automatically to my current filters and not need to add it manually

22
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.290
after refreshing.

23
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.660
So to do that,

24
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.140
I can right click on,

25
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.620
then go to feel settings,

26
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.300
and then I need to check this check box Here.

27
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.040
Include new items in manual filter and click.

28
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.650
OK,

29
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.500
now,

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.590
if I go back to my data here and and copy with row and paste it and add a completely new

31
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.080
person.

32
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.200
So John Doe,

33
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.060
for example,

34
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.420
And then I refresh my pivot iwill here.

35
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.690
Right click refresh.

36
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.160
He comes here that John Doe has been added automatically without me needing to add it to

37
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.220
the current filtered values.

38
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.580
Okay,

39
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.170
so this is how you can add new items automatically to your filters.
