1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
Okay,

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,920
so that's speak about a term that you were here are lot when dealing with pivot tables,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,690
which is called the pivot cash.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,450
So when you create a pivot table,

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,570
a copy of your data is stored in what is called a pivot cash.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,020
So the pivot cash is basically a duplicate of your data table,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,570
and it's created whenever you create a pivot table and the pivot cash is like a snapshot of

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,380
your data table.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,110
So whenever your data is updated so more Roeser added,

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,460
or values in your data are changed,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:42,490
you will need to refresh your pivot table in order for another snapshot to be taken from

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:49,050
your data and put in your pivot cash and ultimately get your pivot table updated within you

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,540
data.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,460
So the pivot cash is just a snapshot from your data.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,430
And this is why whenever your data is updated,

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,250
this snapshot becomes old and we need to take another snapshot.

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,330
And when we take another snapshot,

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,890
which is by refreshing our pivot table are pivot table gets updated with the new values.

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,230
So in this lecture,

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:15,900
we were just explaining the concept of the pivot cash and how it works and the pivot cash

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,730
the data in the pivot.

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,860
Catch guests stored in the background system of your computer and off course because it's a

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,050
duplicate of your data or a snapshot of your data if you have a big amount of data.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,300
If you have hundreds of thousands of rose and and you don't have enough resource is on your

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,910
computer,

26
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:41,090
you might see your computer slowing down when you're dealing with pivot tables having

27
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,650
hundreds of thousands of rose.

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,060
Okay,

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,550
so that's it,

30
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,800
guys,

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,300
for the pivot.

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,850
Cash.

33
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,680
Thanks for watching I'll see on the next one.
