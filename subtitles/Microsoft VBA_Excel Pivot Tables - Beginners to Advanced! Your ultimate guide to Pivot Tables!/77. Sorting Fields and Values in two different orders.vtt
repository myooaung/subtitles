00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570
it is also possible to sort my fields and values in two different orders.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.900
So,

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.470
for example,

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.700
I consort my values in a descending order by right clicking,

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.640
going to sort and then sort largest to smallest on this way off sort of my values and a

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.150
descending order for all the reasons here.

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.960
And I can also sort my reasons and in ascending order there currently sorted in ascending

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.260
order.

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.010
But to do that,

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.920
you read just right.

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
Click here and then go to sort and then sort a to Z.

12
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.620
You could also right click Go to sort more sort options and make sure you have the sorting

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.940
here are sending eight easy by reason and click OK,

14
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.720
so now I have my reason sorted in ascending order while my values are sorted in a this

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.650
sending order
