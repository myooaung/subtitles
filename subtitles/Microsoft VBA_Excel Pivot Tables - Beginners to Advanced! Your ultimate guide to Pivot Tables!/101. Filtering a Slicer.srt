00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
in this video,

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,650
we're going to see how we can filter or select items from a slicer,

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,160
so to select items from a slicer.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,520
So to select a single item from a slicer,

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,760
you can just click on that particular item and to select multiple items,

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,930
you can click on the first item and then press and hold the control button on your keyboard

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,730
and then start selecting the other individual items.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,440
If you need to select contiguous items,

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,190
you can click on the first item and then press and hold the shift key and then press on the

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,470
lost item in the list that you need to select.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,600
And there you go.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,290
You can see here that all the items between your first item and your last item have been

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,850
selected.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,030
You could also select multiple items by pressing on one item and then holding the left

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,810
mouse button and then dragging down to the last item like this,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,220
you could drag from top to bottom.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,610
You could also drag from bottom to top as well.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,140
You could also de select some items in the middle by pressing and holding the control key

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,110
and then starting to de select your items.

20
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,080
And if you need to de select all the items or unfiltered the slicer,

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,770
you can just click on this button to clear all the filters here.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,190
Okay,

23
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,890
so that's say,

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,780
guys on how to select items in the slicer.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,230
