1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Okay,

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,110
so here we've got a pivot table.

3
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,040
We've got our months on the road section and we've got the submission of sales amount here

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
on the submission of Value section.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,560
And let's say we want a place of formatting to the submission of sales amount.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,980
So Atacama and a currency so we can click on any cell here on the sales amount and then

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,410
right click and go to number format.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,380
Alternatively,

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,130
compressed control on one on your keyboard and you'll get to the same dollar box here we

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,560
can go to accounting.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,290
We can remove the decimal places and give it an accounting form.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,810
And we can also select our currency here.

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,190
English,

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,090
United States press okay.

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,190
And Deacon sear that we've applied formatting to the submission of sales amount.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,860
However,

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,270
if we put the sales amount again on the submission of Value Section to do,

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,660
let's say a different kind of announces,

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,680
he can see here that the formatting has not been applied and we'd have to reapply it again

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:55,680
.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,630
So to get around this and make our formatting stick,

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,090
we need to do it in a different way.

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,320
So press control and Z twice on my keyboard here so that I would go back to the original

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,330
form and then while selecting a cell inside my pivot table,

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:19,800
I can go to the analyzed tab on the ribbon and then go to select and entire pivot table,

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,870
and then I'll go back to select and go to values year,

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,160
and then we need to go to the number formatting.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,600
But instead of right clicking,

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,730
you cannot right click.

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,720
In this case,

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,770
you have to press control on one on your keyboard to press control,

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,710
and one because if you right click and select format cells,

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,670
it will not work.

34
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,130
So we pressed control,

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,560
and one,

36
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,960
we are now on the format cells dialog box.

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,220
We're gonna go to accounting,

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,860
remove the decimal places and select English United States.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,460
And then we're gonna press.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,010
Okay,

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,940
Jake is here.

42
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,500
The formatting has been applied.

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,860
Now,

44
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,520
if we drag and drop the sales amount again on the submission of Value Section,

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,730
you can see here that the formatting has stuck to this sales amount and this is how you can

46
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,560
apply formatting to your values and make it stick
