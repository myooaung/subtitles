00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
if we need to modify your delete,

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.870
a calculated field or we need to do is to select our pivot table and then go to pivot table

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.010
in on my stub,

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.110
and they go to feels items and sets.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.650
Click on calculated field,

6
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.010
and we would select the calculated feel that we need to modify your delete.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.290
So,

8
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.970
for example,

9
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.850
our sales margin here what we can do if you need to delete it,

10
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.790
you can just click on delete here,

11
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.110
and then it will be deleted and it will be deleted from the field list.

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.620
A swell.

13
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.150
So if we click OK here.

14
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.200
Because here now that the Salesman Russian does not exist anymore on the pivot table field

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.690
lists,

16
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.380
and it doesn't exist on our pivot table as well.

17
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.180
And please know that you cannot undo that by pressing control and C on your keyboard.

18
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.470
So if a press control Z here on my keyboard,

19
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.660
I won't be able to undo the action of the leading the calculated field.

20
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.760
So please be sure that you need to delete the calculated field before deleting it.

21
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.500
Now,

22
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.910
if you need to modify a calculated field,

23
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.360
you can select your pivot table.

24
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.990
Click on fields,

25
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.770
items and sets,

26
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.180
click on calculated field and then select the field that you need to modify.

27
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
Click on the modify button here and start modifying the calculated field so you can modify

28
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.390
the calculation on it,

29
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.050
for example,

30
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.620
so we could make the cost of goods sold be cost by one million.

31
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.500
So that's just any random calculation here.

32
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.710
It doesn't mean anything.

33
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.200
And then we're going to click OK here and is because here we managed to modify that

34
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.250
calculated field.

35
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.500
And still,

36
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.510
if we press controls the honor keyboard,

37
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.780
we're not gonna be able to undo that action.

38
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.480
So if we need to modify back to what it was,

39
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.670
we got to go to feels items,

40
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.250
sets calculated fields here and then select the field,

41
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.150
click on the modify button and modify it again.

42
00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.200
So this is gonna be the cost divided by the sales amount and click OK here and now we put

43
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.710
it back to what it waas.

44
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.210
So now you know how to modify or delete a calculated field,

45
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.630
and you need to bear in mind that you cannot undo the action of modifying good,

46
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.690
deleting the calculated field to please be sure of what you need to do.

47
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.010
So thanks,

48
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.220

49
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.290
