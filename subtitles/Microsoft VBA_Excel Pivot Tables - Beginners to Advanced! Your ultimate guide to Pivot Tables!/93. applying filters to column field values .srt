1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
and this video,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,460
we're going to see how we can apply filters to column field values.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,270
So here we've got our pivot table and we have the sales person of the Rose section,

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,220
and we've got the year on the columns section and the summer sales about on the submission

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,250
of Value Section.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,150
And let's say I want to filter the sales in the year 2018 by a certain value So,

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,950
for example,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,910
greater than 200,000 now.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,300
I can't click here on the Header 2018 and then go to data and then click on Filter.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,460
You can see her Excel is not allowing me to do so.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,190
So in order to apply filters to column field values year,

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,890
we need to click on just a cell beside the column field headers here.

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,660
So click here and then either click on this filter button on the data tab on the ribbon,

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,990
or you could also press control shift out.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,880
So control shift al toggles a filter here on our off.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,180
So as you can see her now,

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,870
I have some field headers and I can click on them and start filtering.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,330
So,

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:07,810
for example,

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,900
I'm gonna filter the numbers for 2018 greater than or equal to 200,000 and click OK here

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,080
and the second tier of applied a filter just to the values of 2018.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,470
And,

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,070
of course,

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,660
2017 has been filtered with it as well.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,460
And if you consider,

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,150
I've been able to apply a filter to the values of 2018.

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,400
So this is how you can apply filters to column field values.
