00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
and this video,

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.200
we're going to speak about grand totals in pivot tables.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.130
So when we select a pivot table,

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.850
we have the option to view.

5
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.030
The grand totals wore either the Rose on Lee or the columns on Lee or for both.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.110
Or we can actually hide the grand totals for both the rows and columns.

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.110
So to do that,

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.210
you need to select a cell in your pivot table and then go to the design tab on the ribbon

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.090
and then under grand totals.

10
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.520
Here you'll see four options off for rows and columns,

11
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.590
and that removes the grand totals from both rows and columns.

12
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.750
So if we click on that,

13
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.760
you can see here that the grant holders have been removed.

14
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.910
The grant of those feroz and the grand totals for columns they both have been removed.

15
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
And if you go back to the grand totals option here,

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.250
if you press on for rows and columns,

17
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.800
you can see here we have grand totals for both the roads and the columns.

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.730
And then there is on for Rose on Lee,

19
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.450
so that shows the grand totals Onley for Rose.

20
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.180
And then there is on for columns only.

21
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.230
and that shows two grand total Onley for columns.

22
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.070
However,

23
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.540
usually I prefer the on for rows and columns option.

24
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.300
So thanks,

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.830
guys watching I'll see on the next.
