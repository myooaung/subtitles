00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
in this video,

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.350
we're going to speak about date filters in pivot tables,

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.250
says you can see here.

4
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.430
We've got our pivot table where we have the order date on the world section and the summer

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.880
sales amount on the Submission of Value Section.

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
And we do have some built in options in pivot tables in order to filter dates.

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.150
So free click here on this arrow.

8
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.910
We confortable filter dates by checking or un checking dates.

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700
So when we uncheck the dates,

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.040
we filter them off,

11
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.260
and when we have them checked,

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.880
then they will appear on our list of dates.

13
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.280
The second thing is that we can go toe date filters here and filter using these built in

14
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.930
options.

15
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.030
So first option here,

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.670
for examples,

17
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.380
equals so filtering for the date to be equal to a certain dates of,

18
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.190
for example,

19
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.390
the sixth of January 2019 and is against here.

20
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.990
We do have a date here on the list sick Virginia 2019 who managed to filter for that

21
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.980
particular date,

22
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.630
or press control and Z here to a movement filter.

23
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.060
And we do have some other filters.

24
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.540
So before certain dates,

25
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.840
after a certain date.

26
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.020
And this one here is between two dates.

27
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.000
So you give it to dates here and you can filter between these two dates.

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.580
And this includes the two dates as well that you will filter between them.

29
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.120
So if one of your boundary dates here is on the list,

30
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.470
it will appear.

31
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.850
And if we go again here to the date filters,

32
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.170
would you have tomorrow,

33
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.680
today and yesterday.

34
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.190
So these are dynamic filters,

35
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.480
and these filters will update every day.

36
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.690
So,

37
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.650
for example,

38
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.450
a few filter for tomorrow and then you open this Excel workbook tomorrow after you've saved

39
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.900
the filter as tomorrow,

40
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.650
it will filter for the date for after tomorrow.

41
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.860
So this is interactive.

42
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.630
According to today,

43
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.410
state what today's date is and it will filter for tomorrow every day.

44
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.100
And same goes for today,

45
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.150
yesterday,

46
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.110
next week,

47
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.270
this week and last week.

48
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.470
So these air also dynamic.

49
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.260
So the sense what today's date is and they check what this week is and they will give you

50
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.450
next week as well.

51
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.630
And this week and last week Now,

52
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.590
let me know something about next week,

53
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.710
this week and last week,

54
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.230
the assume that the week starts on a Sunday.

55
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.530
So what if the week starts on a Monday or Tuesday or Friday?

56
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.680
What do we do if we need to apply such a filter?

57
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.210
Well,

58
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.970
address that shortly,

59
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.170
but let's just school through the other filters and then we'll answer that question.

60
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.650
So here we've got next month this month last month.

61
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.490
I think they are self explanatory.

62
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.580
They filter for this month or next month or last month,

63
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.350
and the month starts from the first of the month till the under the month.

64
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.040
Nothing unusual here.

65
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.760
We've got next quarter this quarter and last quarter,

66
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.570
so we will filter for this quarter or next,

67
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.450
whether or last quarter and these air calendar quarters and have explained how to do kind

68
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.750
of the quarter calculations using four meters in previous videos.

69
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.520
And I think this is very easy next year,

70
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.080
this year and last year.

71
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.790
Also,

72
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.900
we're filter for this year or next year or last year.

73
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.410
It's the calendar year,

74
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.580
and this explains itself as well.

75
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.770
Now there is the year to date filter,

76
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.310
so this will filter for the dates for the current year,

77
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.310
year to date.

78
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.640
So far,

79
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.240
apply this filter were currently in 2019.

80
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.690
So this should show only dates in 2019 and show you the Grendel for 2090.

81
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.460
However,

82
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:48.160
if you do this filter on the 31st of December 2000 and 18 and then you save the workbook

83
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.750
and you open it on the 10th of January 2019 it will actually only show you the dates in

84
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.880
2019

85
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.770
Whilst when you did it on the 31st of December 2018 it showed you the dates for 2018.

86
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.390
So this is interactive as well.

87
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.390
It will sends which day is today in which year were at,

88
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.420
and it will show you the dates for the year we're currently at.

89
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.970
Now let's clear the filter and let's check the other options here.

90
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.370
So here we have old dates in the period.

91
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.350
So here,

92
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.010
if you click on quarter one,

93
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.260
this will show you all the dates are in quarter one,

94
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.740
regardless of the year.

95
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.830
So if you click on that,

96
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.340
you'll see her.

97
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.630
They will show the states in quarter one in 2018.

98
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.750
In 2019 which of the years in our data set because here,

99
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.390
this will filter for quarter one.

100
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.300
If you go again here old,

101
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.250
it's in the period.

102
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.210
So this one will show you the dates in certain month regardless of the year.

103
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.580
Right?

104
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.360
So if you choose,

105
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.300
February will show you dates in February in both 18 4019 and same goes for the rest of the

106
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.850
months.

107
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.750
There is also the option to do a custom filter here.

108
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.980
So if I click on custom filter you could do the filter is equal to a certain day.

109
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.640
Does not equal a certain date is before a certain date is before equal toe,

110
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.150
so less than or equal to a certain date is after is greater than a certain date is after

111
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.790
equal to a certain date that's greater than equal to a certain date,

112
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.770
is between two dates and is not between two dates,

113
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.640
and he selected dates here using this calendar.

114
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.860
Now let me answer the question here for what if we want to starting day the week to be a

115
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.140
day other than Sunday,

116
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.680
because when we filter for this week or last week or next week,

117
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.730
the Excel pivot table assumes that the week starts from Sunday.

118
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.290
So what if we want the week to start on Monday?

119
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.230
There's a work around to do well.

120
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.150
There is a work around to do that,

121
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.390
but we need to use formulas.

122
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.650
So here,

123
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.150
first of all,

124
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.890
we need to calculate the week number and to tackle the weak number,

125
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.710
we can use the week numb function here and the week.

126
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.510
NAM accepts two arguments.

127
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.190
First argument is the date and the return type.

128
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.420
Here is basically which day of the week the week begins at what if we want the week to

129
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.410
begin on Monday and to know this week or next week or last week,

130
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.460
depending on a week starting on Monday.

131
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.500
So first of all will press enter here,

132
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.890
and this will basically give us the week number off that particular week.

133
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.700
If we drag the four minute down,

134
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.590
you can see her were able to calculate the week number.

135
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.510
Now if we need to filter forward last week,

136
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.380
but this week starts on Monday,

137
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.820
then we'll create a formula for that and the formula is basically that this week number is

138
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.940
equal to the week numb of today.

139
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.170
This is the today function which will give us today state and well selected.

140
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.250
The start of the week is Monday minus one.

141
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.940
So what does this for me to do?

142
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.630
It will give us a tour false value on whether this week number is equal to the week number

143
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.270
off today minus one.

144
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.820
So this means that the week number four last week.

145
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.450
So if you press enter here,

146
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.340
it will give us false on most of the cells.

147
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.040
But on some of the cells that will give us true Because here,

148
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.690
for example,

149
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.480
the date is 26th of January 2019.

150
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.130
Today is the first of February,

151
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.100
So this is on the week of last week.

152
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.840
So if you check here our calendar,

153
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.380
you can see her.

154
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.720
Today is a Friday and this week started on 28th of January.

155
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.590
So the 26th of January was on the week off last week,

156
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.990
right?

157
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.360
This is why it gives us a true here and now we can simply copy our pivot table here and

158
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.400
just had a filter here and now we can simply first of all go to a private table,

159
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.260
refresh it,

160
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.600
and then we can copy our pivot table and put a filter here for last week Monday.

161
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.040
So if you put that on the filters and filter for true,

162
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.600
you can see her.

163
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.370
We've been able to filter for Lost Weeks dates for a week,

164
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.250
starting on a Monday,

165
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:05.750
and it's always useful to think about filters as a logical comparison that yields a true or

166
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.260
false.

167
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:12.320
So this way you can create any kind of filter that you would like on pivot tables just

168
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.460
created in the formulas,

169
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.680
and then just create a four minute that use a tour,

170
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.170
false value or one or zero or any group of values,

171
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.190
and then put it in the filter's area and then filter for a certain value.

172
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:31.610
And you can always think about a filter as a logical operation that yields to or false.

173
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.450
And using this principle,

174
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.810
you can create any filter that you would like on a pivot table.

175
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.570
Just great,

176
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:45.030
a formula that yields one or more values and then filter for one or more values on your

177
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.870
pivot tables.

178
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.430
Good guys.

179
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.620
So that's it for filtering by dates.

180
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.650
Thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see you on the next one
