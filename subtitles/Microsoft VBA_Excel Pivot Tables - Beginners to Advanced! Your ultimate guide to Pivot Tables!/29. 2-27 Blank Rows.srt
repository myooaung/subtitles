00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
When using pivot tables,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,030
you have the option to insert an extra line after each item.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,310
And to do that you need to select a cell inside your pivot table,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,390
go to design tab on the ribbon,

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,910
and then here we got under the layout group would get blank rows here.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,850
And if you click on insert blank line after each item,

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,010
sincere that now a blank line gets inserted after each item.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,320
So that gives you a little bit more space on your pivot table report.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,640
If you need not to have that space,

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,950
you can click on Remove blank line after each item,

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,380
and as you can see here,

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,510
the blank line has been removed.
