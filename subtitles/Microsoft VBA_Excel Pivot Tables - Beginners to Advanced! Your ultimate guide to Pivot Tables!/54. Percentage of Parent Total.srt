1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
in this video,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,600
we're going to explain the percentage apparent total calculation.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,740
So the percentage oh parent total calculation shows the cells percentage based on a chosen

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,300
parent or base field,

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:20,570
and the percentage is based on that particular field instead of using each fields immediate

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,280
parent.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,720
So the main difference between this calculation and the percentage of parent throw total

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,410
calculation,

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,110
for example,

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,920
is that the calculation is based on a field that you can choose any other field that you

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,430
can choose instead of the calculation based on the field that is thean immediate parent off

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,410
your field.

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:50,550
So let's actually taken example here and have created a pivot table here with three

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,870
different calculations so that we can see the difference,

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,970
and this will make it easier for us to understand the concept.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,420
So I've got a pivot table here where I've got the region and the product name and the sales

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,250
person on the roads section here,

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,540
and I've created three different calculations.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,770
So,

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,380
first of all,

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,750
the percentage of grand total and we've seen this calculation before.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,690
We've explained it on a previous video.

23
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:21,080
The percentage of grand total calculation is basically the percentage of the amount here,

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,710
which is the sales,

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,240
for example,

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,500
for Ivan Davis,

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,560
for product one in the Americas.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,040
Okay,

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,140
so this is the amount here.

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,270
38,803.

31
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:39,290
So open 48% is the percentage of this amount 30,803 from the grand total,

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,850
which is eight million,

33
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,890
114,925.

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,850
So this is the percentage off the grand total.

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:53,110
It's opening 48% and then we have the percentage of the parent row total.

36
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,230
So what is the parent row here?

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,500
The parent row is basically the field that is just above the sales person here.

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,790
Right?

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,150
So this amount,

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,050
the amount of the sales 38,803 is the amount of the sales for that particular sales person

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,050
.

42
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,180
Which is Ivan Davis.

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,500
Right?

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,330
So what is the field just above it?

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,570
Here on the hierarchy,

46
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,850
on the roads section here,

47
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,180
the parent TRO is actually the product name,

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,560
right?

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,560
So this is the sales for Ivan Davis inside product one or the sales for Ivan Davis that he

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,610
sold how much he stole product 14 so it's 38,800 freeze.

51
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,750
So this is 17.63% off his sales for product one.

52
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,920
And that is in the Americas as well.

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,540
So 38,008.

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:51,660
So basically 38,803 is 17.63% of 220 1001 127 which is the sales for product one in the

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,310
Americas.

56
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,250
So it's basically dividing the amount by its parent row,

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,160
and the parent troll here is the product one.

58
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,970
And how can we determine the parent row?

59
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,520
It's the one just above it.

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,900
Here on the roads section.

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,960
This is the parent rope,

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,770
and we've explained the percentage of the parent row total on a previous video.

63
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,030
But I'm having here on the comparison so that you can easily understand the difference

64
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,280
between it and the percentage of parent total.

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,150
So all we've covered so far our calculations that we've covered on previous videos,

66
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,000
but where including them here so that you can easily understand the new calculation here.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,570
So what is the new calculation?

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,650
It's the percentage of parent total,

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,860
so because you can choose the parent by yourself.

70
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,210
So I've chosen the parent here to be the region.

71
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,590
So how can I do that?

72
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,020
I'll actually remove this third calculation and reinserted again so that I can show you how

73
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,560
have done it.

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,850
So I'm gonna insert again another instance of the sales amount here.

75
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,110
I'm going to click on it,

76
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,290
go to value field settings here,

77
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,170
and then go to show values as.

78
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,220
And then instead of no calculation,

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,290
I'm going to select percentage apparent total calculation.

80
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,100
I'm going to select my parent as the region so that we would have the percentage of Ivan

81
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,010
Davis from the sales of the Americas,

82
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,850
for example.

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,430
So I'm going to change the name here.

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,030
2% of region total.

85
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,680
I'm gonna click.

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,230
OK,

87
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,700
Ok,

88
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,670
so what does this number represent?

89
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,320
2.63%.

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:28,900
This is the percentage of 38,803 from the region which is the Americas in this case

91
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,930
1,474,967.

92
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,410
So this number here represents stooping 63% off the percentage of sales in the Americas.

93
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,660
Where is actually this number which is the percentage of parent row totals the percentage

94
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,640
of the parent row.

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,820
So the row immediately above the sales person,

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,680
which is not the reason it's actually the products.

97
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,500
So this number represents 17.63% of the percentage off sales or product one.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,910
And that is in the Americas.

99
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,570
Roles was not product one in the absolute,

100
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,780
its product one in the Americas.

101
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,370
Okay,

102
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:14,650
so I hope that I've been able to illustrate the difference between the two calculations,

103
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,450
which is the percentage of parent wrote total on the percentage of parent total.

104
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,580
Through this comparison,

105
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,260
I know it could be sometimes confusing,

106
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,210
but I think the comparison here,

107
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,070
in my opinion,

108
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,670
would be the best approach to show the difference between the two calculations.

109
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,380
So thanks guys watching this video,

110
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,950
and I'll see you on the next one.
