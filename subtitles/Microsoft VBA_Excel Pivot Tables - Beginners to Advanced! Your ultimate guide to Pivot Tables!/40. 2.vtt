Sometimes your pivot tables might have some errors like the division by zero error,

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.460
for example,

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.110
and you could have this air because one of the values here had a division by zero air on

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.060
your data set here.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.330
So one of the values on the sales amount had a division by zero error,

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.060
for example,

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.160
so to deal with that error or to change how it would look on your pivot table instead of

8
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.870
this ugly Dave error,

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.290
you can right click on your pivot table and then go to pivot table options and then under

10
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.310
layout and format,

11
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.550
here we get for air values show,

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.930
and then you can just check that check box and then write the value that you need to

13
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.240
display instead of the error.

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.400
So you could write a zero,

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.130
for example,

16
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.850
or you could write the word error and press OK.

17
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.000
And as you can see here now,

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.420
the word there appears instead of division by zero.

19
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960
Or you can also change it to a certain number such a zero,

20
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.800
for example,

21
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.580
press OK and you can see here it's been changed to a zero,

22
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.790
so this is how you can change how air values look on your pivot table
