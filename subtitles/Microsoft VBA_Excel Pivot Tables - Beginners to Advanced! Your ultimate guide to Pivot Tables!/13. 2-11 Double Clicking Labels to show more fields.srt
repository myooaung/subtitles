1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
Okay,

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,130
Here's another tip that I want to show you,

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:09,280
which is that we can double click on any row or column label items to show more fields.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,490
So,

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,220
for example,

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,270
here if we double click on product one,

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,950
which is on the road section here,

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,760
we can get we get a list of the fields and we can actually add more feels,

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,630
which basically would breakdown product one.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:21,870
So,

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,710
for example,

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,580
we can break down products one by region if you click.

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,040
OK,

14
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,420
here,

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,350
you guys hear that?

16
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,200
Now we have a breakdown for product one by region,

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
which is America's Australia and Europe.

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,320
So we get the sales a month for each region under product one.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,990
As you can see here as well,

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,340
the region field has been added to the rose section below product one.

21
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,860
And when it's put below product one like this,

22
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,610
this means that it breaks down product one by region,

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,150
okay and use.

24
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,350
You can see here as well.

25
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,670
Product to and product three and product for all have been broken down by region as a

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,420
result of the action that I've taken,

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,350
which is adding the region under the product name basically and we can do the same for the

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,720
year here for double click on the year Weaken.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,940
Break it down by the month.

30
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,350
So by its sales month,

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,360
if we click OK,

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,750
here,

33
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,730
he could hear that.

34
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:21,810
Now we have 2016 and then older months and then 2017 and in all the months and our pivot

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,210
table is getting pretty long.

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,330
But you get the idea.

37
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,920
Okay,

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,930
so that's a nice tip.

39
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,120
You can double click on the label for any field,

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,170
and you will get a list of the fields and you can break down that field by other fields.
