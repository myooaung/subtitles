1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320
Okay,

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,490
So the second rule for creating or pivot table is do not have any blank rows or blank

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,120
columns in our data.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,850
Says you can see her on our data.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,660
We've got column,

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,970
if is blank.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,620
And we've got to blank rows here,

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,870
row 18 and row 33.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,290
Okay,

10
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,740
so let's try to create a pivot table here and see what happens.

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,040
Now,

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm gonna select my headers here.

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,380
I'm gonna hold my shift key on my keyboard and then select the rest of the headers with my

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,640
arrows on the keyboard.

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,830
And then I'm gonna press control shifting down on my keyboard and keep doing that until I

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,020
said,

17
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,120
like all the data here and then I'm gonna go to insert a pivot table.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,270
I'm going to try to create a new pivot table in your worksheet.

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,440
And as you can see year,

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,330
I'm getting an error.

21
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,380
Pivot table field name is not valid.

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,110
This is because we have a blank column,

23
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,850
so I'm gonna click.

24
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,210
OK,

25
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:50,590
here.

26
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,070
I'm gonna click.

27
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,560
Cancel and I need to delete Molly Blank column.

28
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,400
So right clicked on my column and deleted it.

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,590
And now we need to also make sure not to have any blank crows in the middle off our data

30
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,970
set.

31
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,220
So imagine that you have lots of blank rows.

32
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,040
Not only two,

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,680
but lots.

34
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,660
So you don't want to select them all one by one in order to delete them.

35
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,580
So a better way to do it is to select all your data.

36
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,840
Second year plus control,

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,840
shifting down to select all your data set year on your keyboard and then go to the home tab

38
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,290
on the ribbon click on finding select and click on Go to special.

39
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,700
And then we're going to select blanks.

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:38,150
So this actually select only the blank cells in our selection off cells.

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,600
We're gonna click OK here,

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,830
and you can see here only the blank cells have been selected.

43
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,370
So I'm going to right click on the selected cells on any of the selected cells and then

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,860
click on delete here to delete my cells.

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,390
And I'm going to select entire Oh,

46
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,160
because I want to delete the entire row of cells.

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,310
The are blank.

48
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,790
So I'm gonna click OK here.

49
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,640
And as you can see here,

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,800
I managed to delete my blank rows case I know we can go ahead and press control and ages.

51
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,890
Selector data Make sure that we picked up all the rows here and then go to insert a pivot

52
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,490
table and insert a new pivoted.

53
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,520
As you can see here,

54
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,660
we managed to insert or pivot table,

55
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,620
and this is another rule that you need to follow.

56
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,950
When creating a pivot table.

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,910
Make sure that you do not have any blank crows in the middle of your data or blank columns

58
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,910
.

59
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,330
When you have blank rows,

60
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,150
either they could be missing values.

61
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,270
You need to fill them or if they are blank by error,

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,550
and you just need to remove them than you remove them as we demonstrated.
