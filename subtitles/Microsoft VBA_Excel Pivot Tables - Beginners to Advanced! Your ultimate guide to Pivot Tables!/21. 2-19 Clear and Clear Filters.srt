1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
if you've got multiple filters applied to your pivot table.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,110
So here I've got Filter for the Americas,

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,880
for example in the region and for the salesman.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,660
I've got some filters applied here for some particular months,

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,480
and I just need to clear all the filters all at once with just a click of a button so you

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,910
can quickly clear the filters on your pivot table by selecting a cell inside your private

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,920
table going to the analyzed tab on the ribbon,

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,690
and then here,

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,360
under this clear button,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,600
you press on the arrow,

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,300
and then there is clear filters,

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,090
and this will clear all the filters on your pivot table.

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,420
So now we don't have any filters on our pivot table and if you've created the your pivot

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,400
table in a certain layout,

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,150
so you put some fields in the rose area and some peels in the columns,

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,330
infusing the values,

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:52,310
and you need to clear the pivot table and just redo it from the very beginning again.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,800
So you can also go back to the clear here and then click on clear old and this will clear

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,570
pivot table and it will be ready again to be reconstructed
