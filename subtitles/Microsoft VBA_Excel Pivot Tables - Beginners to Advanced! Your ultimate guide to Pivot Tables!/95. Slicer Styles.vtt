00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
in this video,

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.050
we're going to speak about slicer styles,

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.950
so slices can be moved around like this,

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.590
and you can also resize them as you see fit.

5
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.060
And you could also apply different styles to them.

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.260
So to apply a style to a slicer,

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.650
you need to,

8
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.190
first of all,

9
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.690
selected slicer and then go to the option stab here.

10
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.810
That only appears if you select a slicer.

11
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.250
So if you don't select the slicer,

12
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.650
you won't have this option step.

13
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160
So selected slicer goody options stabbed here.

14
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.520
And as you can see here,

15
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.910
you have some options for your slicers for arranging them and aligning them.

16
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.300
So you have some align tools here on all that,

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.690
but you'll have also the slicer styles,

18
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.240
so these slicer styles options allow you to apply different styles to your spices so you

19
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.450
can apply it like different colors here.

20
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.680
And as you can see here,

21
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.230
you could apply some colors to your slicers.

22
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.510
Different colors there,

23
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.520
not a lot of colors,

24
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.400
but you could also create a custom style which we're going to speak about in another video

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.400
,

26
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.350
and you could also apply a style to multiple slices by clicking on the first slicer and

27
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.980
then holding the control button and selecting oldest lasers,

28
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.670
for example,

29
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.560
using your control button like this and then clicking on a certain style.

30
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.830
And this will apply that particular style to all your slices.

31
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.470
Okay,

32
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.270
so this is how you can apply styles to your slicers.

33
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.890
Thank you so much.

34
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.850
Watch conduce video I'll see on the next one.
