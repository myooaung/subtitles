00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Hey,

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.020
guys,

3
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.700
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.750
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.720
we're going to speak about grouping dates in pivot tables.

6
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.060
So I've got a pivot table here,

7
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.800
and what I'm going to do is that I'm gonna drag the order date here in the road section and

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.180
look,

9
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.700
actually,

10
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.530
what happened?

11
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.670
Excel automatically grouped the dates by quarters and years.

12
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.570
So is because here it's group the dates here by year.

13
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.130
And when you drill down,

14
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.290
it's also been grouped by quarter quarter,

15
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.480
1/4 to while this is actually an order date field.

16
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.280
So you should just contain a date like the first of January 2000 and 16 for example,

17
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.270
just a date,

18
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.160
but excel automatically grouped it.

19
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.590
Depending on your Excel Virgin,

20
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.240
you may or may not experience this,

21
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.030
so I have office 3 65 year.

22
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.980
So this is what happened on my version.

23
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.690
We can actually UN group the dates says to be able to see our dates as normal.

24
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.480
So if you right click here and then go to ungroomed and this will UN group are dates and

25
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.290
we're gonna be able to see our dates as usual.

26
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.650
Now if we need to group our dates we have different options for grouping Weaken,

27
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.660
right click here,

28
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.620
go to group.

29
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.130
And as you can see here we have the start date and the ending date which excel

30
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.040
automatically chooses here based on your data.

31
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.070
So this is the earliest date on my data and this is the latest date on my data.

32
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.940
So Excel has chosen those as to start an end date.

33
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.260
You can edit that and you can write whatever start and end dates you would like And then we

34
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.450
have here the option to group by months or days or quarters or years.

35
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.100
So say when a group by days instead of months here and Digitas here when I clicked on days

36
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.100
,

37
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.850
I need to click again on months toe insulate months because he could actually select

38
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.860
multiple grouping categories or multiple group by criterias.

39
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.740
You could group by days on months and quarters and years at the same time so that you'd

40
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.490
have this drill down effect that we saw at the beginning of the video.

41
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.410
So I'm gonna group by days and,

42
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.810
let's say,

43
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.490
on a group by seven days us to have a week of data group by a week of data.

44
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.930
And if I press okay,

45
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.350
here,

46
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.070
you can see her.

47
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.790
Now My data is grouped by a week.

48
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.380
And if I drag here,

49
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.900
for example,

50
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.830
the sales amount,

51
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.560
I'm able to get the sales amount for each week here.

52
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.940
So this is the sales amount for the week from the 10th of January 2016 Phyllis 16 to

53
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.550
January 2016 and so on and so forth.

54
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.440
I could change my group by criteria so I can right click,

55
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.710
go to group here on instead of days.

56
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.390
I could just select months and un selected days.

57
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.840
And if I click OK here,

58
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.450
I'm able to group by months and far right click again go to group.

59
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.690
And instead of months,

60
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.250
I select quarters.

61
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.950
I could also select quarters and years at the same time,

62
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.680
for example.

63
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.970
And if I click OK,

64
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.560
I get my data group by years and quarters as well.

65
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.340
You can drill down from the year into the quarter,

66
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.930
says Dickens.

67
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.600
Here these air the group buy options here for dates you're able to group by days or months

68
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.220
or quarters or years.

69
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.620
OK,

70
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.180
so that's it,

71
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.320
guys for grouping dates.

72
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.250
Thank you very much Watching this video I'll see on the next one
