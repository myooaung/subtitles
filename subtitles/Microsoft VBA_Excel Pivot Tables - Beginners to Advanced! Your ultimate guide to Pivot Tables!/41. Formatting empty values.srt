1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Sometimes you might have empty data on your pivot table.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,430
So,

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,040
for example,

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,980
here in September 2016 we've got empty data here,

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,820
and the reason for that is that if we go back to our data,

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,180
we can see where the transactions that happened in September 2016 did not have a sales

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,710
amount.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,250
The sales amount is blank.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,410
This is why,

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,300
on our pivot table,

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,120
September 2016 is blank so you could change how the blank cells show on your pivot table.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,510
You could do that by right clicking and then going to pivot table options year.

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,020
And then there's an option here for empty cells show so you can show no transactions,

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,660
for example,

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,770
or no data or anything else.

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,000
So here we've shown no transactions.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,180
So this is how you can change how empty cells show on your pivot table.
