1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
and pivot tables,

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,260
you're able to apply filters using multiple fields.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,800
So on this pivot table here we have the region and the product name on the road section and

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,840
the summer sales of On the Submission of Value Section.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,750
Now we can apply filters using the region and using the product name at the same time.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,700
So,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,390
for example,

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,660
here I can click on this field header.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,360
And then,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,390
as you can see here,

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,480
I've got the selected field as the product name.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,140
I'll just switch that to the region,

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,890
and then I can apply a value filter toe filter for regions that had values and that that

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,550
means the sales.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,710
So it that had some of sales amount greater than 1.5 million.

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,240
So if I click OK,

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,600
here,

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,480
you can see here.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,040
The date on the pivot table has been filtered for regions that had sales greater than 1.5

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,620
million,

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,210
and in this case,

22
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,510
it was only Europe that had sales greater than 1.5 million.

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,110
I could also go ahead and click on the field headers again and apply another filter using

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,460
the product name so I can go here.

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,880
Value filters greater than or equal to.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,200
And I can apply filters for products to have sales greater than one million.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,390
So I can do that here greater than or equal to one million and click OK here and is the

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,980
cause here.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,030
I've been able to filter for products afterwards that had sales greater than or equal to

30
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,010
one million,

31
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,920
and in this case,

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,510
it filtered off product.

33
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:40,350
Three under year says he can see where we're able to apply value filters using multiple

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,150
fields in pivot tables.

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,840
Now,

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,250
if you need to clear these filters,

37
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,880
you can clear them one by one by clicking on the field header and make sure you select the

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,080
field that you need to clear the filter from and then click on clear filter.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,150
And if you need to clear all filters at once,

40
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,790
you can select your pivot table,

41
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,000
go to the data time on the ribbon and then click on this clear button here to clear all the

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,950
filters on your pivot table.

43
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,590
OK,

44
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,270
so that's it,

45
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,660
guys,

46
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,370
for applying filters,

47
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,650
using multiple fields in pivot tables at the same time.

48
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,660
I think it's so much watching this video I'll see on the next one
