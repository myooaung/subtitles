00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
and this video,

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.850
we're going to speak about the expand and collapsed feature in pivot tables,

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.900
so this feature allows you to drill down on specific rows and columns,

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.050
or you can also summarize at a high level.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.490
So next to each item label,

6
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.910
you will see here a plus and minus button,

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.570
and this allows you to expand or collapse that particular label here,

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.090
says Eakins.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.280
Here I'm expanding and collapsing product one.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.650
And that means that I'm either showing or hiding the breakdown off product one by sales

11
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.080
person.

12
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.940
As you can see here on a row section,

13
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.320
we've got the product name,

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.290
and then we get the sales person under.

15
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.120
And that means that the product name will be broken down by sales person.

16
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.530
If you need to expand or collapse,

17
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.890
not only one item,

18
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.710
so I'm currently expanding and collapsing.

19
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.520
Product one.

20
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.140
Just product.

21
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.450
One.

22
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.910
I can also expand and collapsed the entire field.

23
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.120
That means the entire product name fields,

24
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.560
all the products product on product tube and product.

25
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.970
Three.

26
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.820
We can do that by right clicking and then expanding collapse.

27
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.000
We have here also an expanding collapse option,

28
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.980
and this will expand and collapse just this particular item in the field.

29
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.160
But then we have expand entire field and collapse entire fields,

30
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.540
so collapse entire field will collapse all the products,

31
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.470
the whole product name,

32
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.650
field and then expand.

33
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.790
Entire fueled will expand all the products as well.

34
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.350
Another way to do it is to select.

35
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.150
It's the item on your fields year.

36
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.950
Go to the analyzed tab on the ribbon and then under the active field group here you will

37
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.670
see claps,

38
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.540
field and then expand field,

39
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.620
and that expands and collapses the entire field.

40
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.250
Now what happens if you try to expand the bottom?

41
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.240
Most field in the hierarchy here says,

42
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.700
You can see here on the roads section.

43
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.650
We've got the product name and then the product name gets broken down by sales person.

44
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.870
But there is nothing that the sales person gets broken down by or Goetz's drilled into

45
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.510
bicycles.

46
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.480
Here it's the bottle,

47
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.090
most field of our hierarchy.

48
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.390
So what happens if we try to expand that?

49
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.070
Let's see,

50
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.210
Let's right click on any item on our sales person.

51
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.420
So any sales person here and then expanding collapse press expand and basically what you

52
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.410
get here is a dialog box that asks you which field you would like to expand the sales

53
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.140
person with.

54
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.100
As it is here,

55
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.140
we can expend it by any of these fields.

56
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.710
So let's choose the quarter,

57
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.360
for example,

58
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.760
On press.

59
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.390
Okay,

60
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.170
as you can see,

61
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.010
are now each salesperson gets expanded by quarter,

62
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.350
and that means that each sales person gets broken down by quarter.

63
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.080
We can also expand the quarter further,

64
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.690
for example,

65
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.420
by month.

66
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.230
So if we right click here on any of the quarters and then expanding collapse,

67
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.470
expand that and we can expend that by sales month,

68
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.190
for example,

69
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.570
impress.

70
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.070
Okay.

71
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.670
As you can see her,

72
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.520
each quarter is being expanded by month.

73
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.030
And because you're not all the months air appearing because not all the months,

74
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.870
half sales.

75
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.490
So basically only the months that belonged to this quarter that do have sales are appearing

76
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.130
basically.

77
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.810
And and this is also for that particular sex person says you can see here we get each

78
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.390
quarter broken down by month.

79
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.100
You can also do the same here on the column section.

80
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.240
So even if we move the quarter here to the column section,

81
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.110
you can see here that we've got a drill down here year.

82
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.680
You can drill down into the year by quarter,

83
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.810
as you can see here,

84
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.750
using this expand and collapse button.

85
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.140
And then you can also drill down the quarter by month as well as you can see here,

86
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.440
you can drill down the quarter by month.

87
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.380
You can also right click and expanding collapsed the entire field as we showed previously.

88
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.770
We can also collapse the whole pivot table here so we can actually click on the year and

89
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.970
then collapsed field,

90
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.650
so that basically collapses.

91
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.880
Older feels under it.

92
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.080
You can also collapse on Lee the quarter so that you would still have the year broken down

93
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.020
by the quarter so you can actually shape your pivot table whichever way you like.

94
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.100
So you can basically collapse.

95
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.560
The pivot table here collapse entire field so that you get a high level view that you can

96
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.020
send to the upper management or the executives,

97
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.640
for example,

98
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.770
who don't care much about the details they just wanted.

99
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.100
See the big picture,

100
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.330
and then you can also drill down into individual items so that you can do more analysis on

101
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.770
your data or send that to the particular departments who would basically be interested in

102
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.880
the details.

103
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.580
One more thing I'd like to show you is how you can hide or show the expanding collapse

104
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.930
buttons to these plus on minus buttons.

105
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.450
You can do that through going to the anal I stabbed here on the ribbon and then here you've

106
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.130
got a plus and minus buttons button here.

107
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.770
So if you press on that,

108
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.790
you can tuggle these plus and minus buttons on or off so that you can show on hide them.

109
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.690
And by the way,

110
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.890
if they are hidden,

111
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.810
you can still expand and collapse.

112
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.610
Using the buttons year on the active field area,

113
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.070
expand field or collapse field here is you can see or by right clicking and doing that

114
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.830
through the expand collapse options.

115
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.630
So that's it,

116
00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.980
guys,

117
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.680
for the expanding collapsed feature on pivot tables,

118
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.110
Thank you very much for watching and
