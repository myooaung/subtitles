00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
in this video,

2
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.120
we're going to speak about changing the options for the sub totals in pivot tables.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.240
So sub totals are the totals for certain feels in your pivot tables,

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.480
and let's see how we can change them.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.400
So if we select any cell in our pivot table and then go to design tab on the ribbon and

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.270
then under the Laila Group here,

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.340
there is an option called sub totals.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.190
So Weaken choose to not show the sub totals.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.250
So the subtitles here,

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.930
for example,

11
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.920
are settles here bold ID for product one and product to.

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.390
And so for each product here,

13
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.620
these air sub totals So subtitles a usually actually bold ID.

14
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.790
So if we choose to not show the subtitles,

15
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.550
you'll see that they will disappear.

16
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.150
There you go.

17
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.340
And then you could choose to show also toes at the bottom of a group.

18
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.230
This way we will have the subtitle for each product at the bottom.

19
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.680
Here she can see air suitable for product wins a total for product to at the bottom off the

20
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.650
group and then show all subtitles at top of the group.

21
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.430
You will see that the subtitles will move back to the top,

22
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.660
and that is the original layout that we had previously.

23
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.380
Also,

24
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
when you add more fields under the rose section here,

25
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.380
you will see that there will be a subtitle for all the fields except the lost one.

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.370
So basically,

27
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.060
if we had a fueled for the region,

28
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.020
for example here,

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.010
so we'll have product name and then sales person and then region on the roads sections you

30
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.650
can see here.

31
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.410
You'll see here we will have a sub total now for the product and then acceptable for the

32
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.510
sales person.

33
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.590
But we will not have a sub total for the region because this is the lost item,

34
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.660
basically the bottom most item in the row section.

35
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.450
This item does not have a subtitle because each item is basically it's a total.

36
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.210
It doesn't need to have a subtitle there.

37
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.610
No items to break it down with.

38
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.230
Basically.

39
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.770
So this is how you can change septal options in pivot tables.

40
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.680
Thanks for watching us see on the next one
