00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
in this video,

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,190
we're going to explain the percentage apparent column calculation aint pivot tables.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,150
So you could probably guess what that does since we've explained the percentage of Parent

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,480
Row total calculation.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
So instead of showing the percentage based on the parent row,

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,970
it's going to show the percentage based on the parent column.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,990
So that's insert another field here for the sales amount and then click on it.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:30,230
Go to value field settings go to show values as on them percentage apparent column total

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,580
here,

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,890
and we can name that percentage of parent column.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,880
And if you press OK here,

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,610
you can see here what we get.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,150
The percentages that we get here are the percentages of each quarter from their parent

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,580
column,

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,160
which is the year here.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,960
So the year here is the parent column,

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,680
since it's the one above the quarter on the columns section here in hierarchy.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,550
So what it's saying here is that,

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,470
for example,

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,320
for key one,

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,150
it's 7.6% in 2016 off the total sales for 2016.

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:13,370
And for Q two it was 32.63% off the total sales in 2016 and so on and so forth.

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,960
If you add the percentages for each quarter in 2016 here for key one key to Q three and Q

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,380
four,

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,590
you'll see here that we get a submission of,

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,730
ah,

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,680
100% under 100%.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:33,590
It's basically this amount of sales here for 2000 and 16 and also here for 2016.

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,210
It's 60.36% off its parent column.

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,660
So the parent column is the grand total for all the years here,

31
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,090
which is this amount.

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:52,840
So here you can see here that 2017 the percentage of it is 39.64% of the parent calm.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,070
And the parent column is this total some off sales amount,

34
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,060
which is this grand total.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,300
That represents the grand total for all the columns here.

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,970
Okay,

37
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,580
so that's it,

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:02,920
guys,

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,340
for the percentage of parent column total.

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,310
Thanks for watching.

41
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,100
I'll see on the Net
