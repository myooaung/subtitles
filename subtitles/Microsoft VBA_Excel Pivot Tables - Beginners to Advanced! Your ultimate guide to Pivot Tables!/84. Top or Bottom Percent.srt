1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
and this video,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,430
we're going to see how we can filter for the top or bottom percentage in a pivot table.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,890
So here we've got a pivot table and we've got the retailer column on the road section and

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,340
get this summer sales amount on this submission of value section.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,140
And if you click here to do a filter on going,

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,430
go to value filters,

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,240
go to top,

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,200
then we can actually filter by the top or bottom 10 items or percent or some.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,710
In this case,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,730
we're going to choose percent,

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,220
and we're going to choose your bottom,

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,530
and we're gonna filter for,

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,030
Let's say,

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:38,410
the bottom 25% off our retailers to determine the worst performing retailers and take

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,670
appropriate action with them.

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,360
So if repress okay,

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,810
here were able to filter for the bottom 25% in terms of performance here in terms of sales

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:48,810
,

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,670
and we can even sort that so we'd know the smallest,

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,440
for example.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,960
So we consort smallest the largest,

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,520
so it no,

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,840
the lowest performing one here would have at the top,

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,150
and this way we can take the necessary action with them in order to improve their

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,990
performance
