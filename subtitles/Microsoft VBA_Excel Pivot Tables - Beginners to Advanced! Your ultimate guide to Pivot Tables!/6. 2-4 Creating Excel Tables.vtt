00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
so a great tool that you should utilize when creating pivot tables out of your data is

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.980
Excel tables.

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.570
So Excel tables have been added to excel since Excel 2007 and their greatest advantages

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.980
that they have structured referencing.

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.950
So this means that as you add more rows or columns to your table,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.200
your table gets expanded automatically.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.260
A new formulas get automatically applied to the new rose without needing to expend them for

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.940
the new rose or without needing to drag them down for the new rose.

9
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.050
So let's see how we can insert a stable so we can insert a table by selecting any cell

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.890
insight our data set and then going to insert and then table.

11
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.680
You can also,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.750
alternatively,

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.760
press control and t on your keyboard,

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.110
and this is how you can insert a stable and you should check.

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.930
My table has headers here if it's got headers and we do actually have header sport tables

16
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.200
or click OK here.

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.220
And as you can see your we've got an Excel table created.

18
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.030
So while selecting any cell in your excel table,

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.090
you can select a design top here on the ribbon,

20
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.070
and you could see her that we've got different styles that you can apply to your table so

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.710
you can have it have different colors or so.

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.440
So I'll just keep this style here.

23
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.120
But you can choose out of these styles and you can also create it new custom style for

24
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.660
yourself.

25
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.870
You can also add a totals row.

26
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.460
So while selecting any cell inside your table,

27
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.700
you go to the design tab on the ribbon and then you check total row.

28
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.500
You can see here that a total world has been added so you can have your on the total row.

29
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
You can have different aggregation formulas.

30
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.560
Seacon select average count Max men some.

31
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.040
So all these air different aggregation for minister,

32
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.570
for example.

33
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.840
Some here would give us the total sales amount for all the rose here.

34
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.070
Now,

35
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.250
if you need to expand your data and add more data to your table,

36
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.750
he can just hover with your mouse here to the edge and Zico's year.

37
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
You will have your mouse turn into a two sided arrow,

38
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.220
two sided dagon,

39
00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.670
an arrow.

40
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.300
So if you click on hold and dragged down with your mouse here,

41
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.940
you can see that you're able to add more rows to your table.

42
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.700
Alternative.

43
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.660
You can also select any row here and right click and then insert to insert Rozier,

44
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.040
and you can repeat the action by pressing F four on your keyboard.

45
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.550
Keep pressing a for and the action will be repeated.

46
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.070
I'll just delete the X arose here because you don't need them.

47
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.260
So select them right click and then delete the rose,

48
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.720
a useful feature for tables as well as to give them a name.

49
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.430
So while selecting any cell inside your table,

50
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.890
you go.

51
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.990
You go to the design tab on the ribbon and you can see her.

52
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.140
There is a field called table name where you can change the name of your table.

53
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.240
So,

54
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.940
for example,

55
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.430
I like to actually name my tables with a prefix,

56
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.550
which is Steve bl and then whatever this stable would be.

57
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.110
So this should be TBL sales,

58
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.730
for example,

59
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.800
as this table is a table of sales,

60
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.650
so I'll name it this way and press enter.

61
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.180
And now,

62
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.740
while selecting any cell inside your table,

63
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.680
you can actually create a pivot table out of it by inserting a pivot table here and ah and

64
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.070
pressing.

65
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.480
Okay,

66
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.120
this will create a pivot table out of your table.

67
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300
You can also go to the design top,

68
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.990
and you can also export it somewhere so you can export it to a SharePoint list.

69
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.720
For example,

70
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.380
you can also on your table.

71
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.860
You can use the filters feature here to filter your data.

72
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.120
OK,

73
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.610
so tables are a very useful feature.

74
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.440
When dealing with pivot tables,

75
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.170
they will make handling your dates up much easier.
