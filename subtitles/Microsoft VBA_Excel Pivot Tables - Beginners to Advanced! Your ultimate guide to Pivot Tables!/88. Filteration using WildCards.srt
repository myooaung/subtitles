1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
and this video,

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,270
we're going to discuss filtering using Walt cards in pivot tables.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,790
So we will be discussing three wild cards here.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,790
The asterisk and question mark and the tilde.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,170
So the first wall card here,

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,900
the Astra's.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,570
It's basically a placeholder for any number of characters.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,000
So if we filter using Jell O and then Astra's this so foot filter with begins with yellow

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,180
and then asterisk,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,310
this will give us all the companies that begin with a Jell O and then any number of

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,010
characters.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,940
So if you go to a pivot table here and they go to label Filters begins with G.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,550
L O Astra's and Notice here that I'm writing Jello in lower case letters.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,970
Although the companies would have upper case letters because searching with wild cards is

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,350
not case sensitive.

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,620
And if we press okay here,

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,060
you can see here that we get the companies that start with the Jell O and then a number of

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,700
characters.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,030
We could also do a filter that is contains Astra Stack.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,460
So this will give us the company's having their name containing any number of words before

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,050
deck.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,100
So for go here,

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,450
too,

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,000
our label footers and then Duke contains.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,290
And then ask stressed Tech and click OK,

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,690
here,

27
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,710
you can see here we get the companies that contain the word tech with any number of

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,100
characters before them.

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,610
And the were tech here because we use the contains filter does not have to be at the end of

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,590
the company's name.

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,100
So because here advanced that company has the word tech in the middle,

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,620
and it has company after,

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,470
so it doesn't have to be at the end off the company name.

34
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,970
We could also do a filter that is equals.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,550
And then Asterisk Inc asked us so we could also do a filter that is equals Asterisk Inc

36
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,270
asterisk.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,270
So this will give us the companies that their name contains I N.

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,450
C in any position anywhere.

39
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,240
So if we do that label filters here and then equals Astra's I N C.

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,560
Astra's and click OK,

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,270
here you can see here we get the companies that their name contains i N.

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,670
C.

43
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,770
In any position.

44
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,190
So Capstan Inc cutting edge ink.

45
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,730
So the 1st 4 companies here contain Inc at the end.

46
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,690
But this one here incorporated ABC company.

47
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,350
This one has i n C at the beginning,

48
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,490
So this will give us the company's having their names containing i n.

49
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:28,970
C.

50
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,650
At any position.

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,250
Now let's check the question mark Placeholder.

52
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,700
So the question mark placeholder is a placeholder for one character or variable.

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,510
So the presence of the question mark means that it would replace Onley.

54
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,400
One character and this character could be any letter or number,

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
and it could be even a space.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,850
So if we filter for contains a question mark,

57
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,380
see,

58
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,980
we would get the companies that contain the combination of A and that any character or

59
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:14,000
letter or space and then seek Sophie Do that here contains a question mark C and click OK,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,500
here we get the companies that the names contained A and then any letter or number or space

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,060
and see.

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,050
So as you can see your ABC Telecom Arc Telecom,

63
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,860
these do contain be on our respectively.

64
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,200
Instead of the question mark here in the position of the question Mark and then

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,290
incorporated ABC company,

66
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,970
we got ABC there on mantra and on this mentor company notice here it's a and then space and

67
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,450
then see between the two parts of the company name mantra and company would get a and then

68
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,480
space and then seek and then on advanced that company.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,500
We've got the A N.

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,250
C part here on Advanced.

71
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,680
This is what made it appear in the filter.

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,710
Now let's speak about the asterisk,

73
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,060
and while you probably wouldn't use it a lot,

74
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,160
it's useful to know what it does.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,640
The asterisk is an escape character,

76
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,720
so that means that you can use it to put a literal asterisk as well or search for a literal

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,900
asterisk in the company's name.

78
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,700
So here,

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,690
if we search with contains Astra's Tilda Astra's,

80
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,100
this means that we're actually searching for a literal asterisk in the company's name.

81
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,170
So there is a company here that is named asterisk and that a literal asterisk.

82
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,960
So if I search with that label,

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,410
filters contains and then asters Tilda asterisk and click OK here.

84
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:49,570
So this means that I'm searching for any number of characters before a literal asterisk,

85
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,470
and you probably wouldn't use that a lot,

86
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,080
but it's just useful to know that.

87
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,010
So that's it,

88
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,890
guys for filtering using Walt cards.

89
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,070
Thanks so much watching.

90
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,390
I'll see on the next one
