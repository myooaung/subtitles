1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
in this video,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,880
we're going to show you some issues that you might face when trying to group dates on your

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,570
pivot table.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,510
Says because here,

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,730
I've got this pivot table and I've got the order date here on the world section and a sum

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,120
of sales amount on the Submission of Value Section.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,850
And I'm gonna try to group my dates here it or so right click and then group.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,900
And as you can see here,

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,660
I get an error.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,250
Cannot group that seduction.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,710
And the reason for that is that I've got some inappropriate data arm Lee date column.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,310
So if I check my order date column here,

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,950
for example,

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,460
this value here,

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,740
this is actually a text value of the date.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,660
So this looks like a date,

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,810
but it's actually not a date.

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,670
If I check here the number formatting Eakins here,

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,750
it's actually giving me the same formatting for all because it's actually a text.

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,020
And there is no number because,

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,330
you know,

22
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,650
if it is actually a date,

23
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,720
it will give me the value of that date under this number here.

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,890
So this is not a date.

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,390
This is just a text.

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,870
I could even test it with the is text function here.

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,730
That gives me a true if this is a text and sure enough,

28
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,450
I get a troop.

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,470
So this is a text naughty date,

30
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,580
so I can actually fix it by just typing in the date like this.

31
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,450
And this one is fixed Now,

32
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,300
now,

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,730
some other issues here,

34
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,400
for example,

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,620
this is an error value and you could Sierra's Well,

36
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,520
I've got here instead of a date of got pull.

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,920
So as you can see here,

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,230
these air some of the issues that you might face because you've got inappropriate data on

39
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,650
the order Date column This column supposed to have only dates.

40
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,960
So in order to detect these values,

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,320
an easy way to do it is to highlight the whole column and press control and g on your

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,280
keyboard for go to and then click on Special here,

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,100
go to special and then you could check for constants Are numbers or texts or logical or

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,460
errors.

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,870
Actually,

46
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,490
we don't want to check for numbers because our dates are actually numbers,

47
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,930
so we don't want to check for that.

48
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,050
We want to check for text,

49
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,370
logic,

50
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,240
ALS and errors.

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,950
And if we click OK here,

52
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,760
because here we managed to select these values.

53
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,710
The are not axity numbers.

54
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,520
We could highlight thumb by filling the color here and his guys here.

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
We managed to highlight them by yellow and we could start changing them.

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,270
So this one,

57
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,740
for example,

58
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,590
is the date in July 2016.

59
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,250
So I'm just gonna write any day tear.

60
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,390
So,

61
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,490
for example,

62
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,890
six of July,

63
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,950
2000 and 60.

64
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,950
And this one is well here.

65
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,900
So this is a date in January 2017.

66
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,730
So I could just write the seventh of January 2017 for example,

67
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,000
and so on and so forth.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,870
And then I could just remove the filling here and no Phil and no Phil here as well.

69
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,720
And we don't have any other values,

70
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,360
and it could do move.

71
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,950
The Phil here is well on the header off the column.

72
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,000
So as you can see here,

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,890
I'm trying to show you the issues that you might face when trying to group dates.

74
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,050
It's mainly because of inappropriate data types on that particular date column.

75
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,140
So that's it,

76
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,370
guys,

77
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,920
for this video.

78
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,010
Thank you so much watching.

79
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,090
I'll see on the next one
