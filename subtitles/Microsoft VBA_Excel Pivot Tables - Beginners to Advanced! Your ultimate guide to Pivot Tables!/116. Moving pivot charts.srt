00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Let's speak about moving pivot charts.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,690
So if you want to move your pivot charts to maybe another sheet,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,130
you have two options.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,840
You can either press on the pivot chart itself,

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,370
and then you can press control and X on your keyboard to move on.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,640
Then you can paste it in another sheet,

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,970
like I'm pasting it here in the data sheet.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,320
So that's one option.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,690
That's one thing that you can do.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,270
I'm gonna move it back again to the pivot sheet here.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,510
Another option is that you can click on your pivot chart and then you can right click here

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,110
on.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,280
Then you can go to move chart.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,250
Or you could go to the design tab on the ribbon and click on Move Chart here.

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,490
And because here you've got the option to move it to an existing worksheet,

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,800
which is the same thing as pressing control and acts on your keyboard to cut it and paste

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,880
it in the other sheet.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,770
Or you have the option to move it to a new sheet,

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,320
which is actually gonna be H.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,880
Archie.

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:02,310
And be careful because this option here is irreversible so you can't press control and Z on

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,500
your keyboard to reverse that process.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,270
Once it's done,

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,070
once it's moved to with a charge sheet,

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,150
you cannot undo that.

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,010
So if it press okay here,

27
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,220
it's moved it to its own chart sheet here.

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,470
It's still linked to the pivot table,

29
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:17,860
though,

30
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,820
so if I,

31
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,500
for example,

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,190
remove the filters year,

33
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:27,640
we have a filter here for filtering the salespeople for for the top five salespeople you

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,450
consider if I remove the filter because here we have more sales people here,

35
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,170
so it's actually interactive.

36
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,410
It's still linked to your pivot table.

37
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,260
I personally do not recommend using the charge sheet.

38
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,380
I don't use them personally,

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,670
but it's up to you.

40
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,630
This option exists if you need to use it.

41
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,800
So in this case,

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,150
if you need to go back,

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,300
you cannot simply press a control and Z on your keyboard.

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,670
You just have to delete this chart sheet here,

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,620
and then you can re insert a chart again.

46
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,300
Here we insert the bar chart again.

47
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:13,150
So I just wanted to give you a heads up about the option and be careful with it because you

48
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,760
will not be able to undo that.

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,420
If you move your chart to a chart sheet,

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,950
you will have to delete the charge sheet and then start again and build your chart again.
