1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
in this video,

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,060
we're going to show how we can apply multiple filters to the same field.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,510
So here we've got our pivot table where we have the years and the sales month on the rose

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,000
section.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,610
And we got the summer sales amount of this emission of value section.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:23,800
And what we need to do is to apply to filters at the same time to the sales month feel.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,680
So the first filter we're gonna apply here,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,610
I'm gonna click on the field headers and make sure that you select the sales month here as

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,540
the field of genital play filter to.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,590
And then we're gonna go to label filters and my filter will be for months containing e r.

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,580
So if I click OK,

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,770
here it is here that I filtered for Onley months containing e r.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:52,880
Now let's say I want to apply another filter through the values on the sales month field,

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,650
so I'm gonna filter for months having sales greater than or equal to 200,000.

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,960
So I'm going to click again here on the field header.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,780
Make sure I select the sales month as the feel they need to filter and then go to value

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,590
filters and then greater than or equal to.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,750
And then 200,000 and click OK,

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,050
and as you can see here,

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,110
we now have months that don't contain E.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,650
R.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,440
So,

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,810
actually,

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,400
the second filter has replaced our first filter,

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,310
and it's not been applied simultaneously on the sales month field.

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,480
So now we don't have the ER filter.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,370
We only have the sales amount filter for the months.

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,670
So as you can see here,

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,990
we were not able to apply to two filters at the same time on the sales month field.

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:57,460
And the reason for that is that there is an option that we need to enable or turn on on our

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,450
pivot table in order to be able to apply to filters to the same field at the same time.

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,520
So to do that,

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,680
we're going to right click and then click on pivot table options and then go to tools and

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,290
filters,

35
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,950
and we need to make sure to allow multiple filled filters per field.

36
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,490
So make sure to check this check box here and click OK,

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,880
and now we're able to apply multiple filters through the same field,

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,630
so I'm gonna clear older filters,

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,950
and I'm gonna start applying my filters again.

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,880
So make sure I select sales month.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm gonna apply label filters.

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,390
First of all,

43
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,440
contains e r.

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,530
Click OK here of going to go again and make sure I select the field is the sales month.

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,970
Go to value filters greater than or equal to 200,000 and click.

46
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,630
OK,

47
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:49,750
and,

48
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,510
as you can see here,

49
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,270
have been able to filter for months containing E R.

50
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,730
And then four months,

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,780
having sales greater than or equal to 200,000 at the same time on the same field,

52
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,070
which is the sales month,

53
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,060
says you consider,

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,960
we've been able to apply two filters to the same field at the same time,

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,020
but we need to make sure to enable this option first.

56
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,850
Allow multiple filters on the same field.

57
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,840
Okay,

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,640
so that's it,

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:21,980
guys,

60
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,400
for applying multiple filters to the same field in pivot tables.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,350
Thanks so much watching this video I'll see on the next one
