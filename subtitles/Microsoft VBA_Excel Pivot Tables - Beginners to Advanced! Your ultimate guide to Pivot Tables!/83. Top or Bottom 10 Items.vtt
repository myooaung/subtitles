00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
in this video,

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.860
we're going to discuss how we can filter with top or bottom 10 items in terms of values.

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.630
So here we've got our pivot table and have added a column to the original data set.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.730
They schooled retailer here so we can filter in pivot tables by this top 10 or bottom turn

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.390
retailers in terms of sales.

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.600
So if we click here to filter and then go to value filters and then go to top 10 we can

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.770
hear select if we want the top or bottom 10 and we can select Upton items percent.

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.280
Or some will discuss these two options in the coming videos.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.330
And here you can see here that we can select whether we want the top 10 or top five so we

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.980
can type the number that we want.

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.390
For now,

12
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.680
we're gonna get top 10 in terms of sales amount,

13
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.650
and then we're gonna press okay here,

14
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.310
Cizikas here.

15
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.900
We got the top 10 retailers in terms of sales amount,

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.040
and we can go ahead and sort them even in its sending order to make our data more clear and

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.130
determine the best performing retailer here.

18
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.780
So it's gravity supermarket This is our top performer.

19
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.010
OK,

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.230
so this is how you can filter by top 10 or bottom 10 items or top five bottom five.

21
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.040
You can filter by the top or bottom end items,

22
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.190
so this is how you can filter by the top or bottom end items in pivot tables.
