00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
in this video,

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,300
we're going to discuss the top or bottom some filter for filtering pivot tables.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,740
So here we've got a pivot table.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,710
We have the retailer on the world section and the sum of sales amount on the submission of

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,570
Value section.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,340
And if you click on this button here and go to value filters and then go to top,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,480
then you could see her.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,100
We've got our top time filter and we can select some here,

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,970
and this will actually give us the top items in our role labels that have a certain

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,600
summation.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,320
So if we select top from here and then we can select,

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,940
for example,

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,530
the top retailers who have a sales amount that some up to three million,

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,210
for example,

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,040
So 3123456 So three million red press.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,640
Okay,

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,890
here and here.

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:54,050
It will give us the top 10 retailers that have sales that some up to three million off

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,320
course,

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,500
because here we have retailers that some up to three million the are less than 10 so they

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,740
shouldn't necessarily be 10.

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,970
If the pivot table finds that we can achieve three million with less than 10 retailers,

23
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,870
then it will only show you these retainers the are less than 10.

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,140
So here is only showing us seven retailers because it managed to get up to the some off

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,510
three million with less than 10 retailers.

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,860
And,

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,170
of course,

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,480
you could do the bottom retailers that sum up to a certain amount as well.

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,830
And this is how this filtration feature work.
