00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
let's say that we need to create to pivot tables from the same data source with two

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.010
different groupings.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.380
So,

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.010
for example,

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.250
here this pivot table is grouped by quarters here on the order date field.

6
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.120
Now let's say we want to create another pivot table from the same data source,

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.040
which is this data here that is grouped by months,

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.660
for example.

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.360
So let's try the traditional approach here.

10
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.690
I'm just gonna insert a pivot table and I'm gonna insert it.

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.610
Let's say in the same worksheet here,

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.500
I want to create it on the same worksheet as this profitable,

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.490
and I want to pivot tables from the same data source with two different groupings.

14
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.150
Now,

15
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.190
I'm gonna create this pivot table here,

16
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.050
and then I'm gonna put the order date here on the world section,

17
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.710
and I'm gonna put the sales amount on the submission of value six and already you're seeing

18
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.790
here it's actually gonna had and grouped by quitters as well.

19
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.580
So it seems like both of these air linked.

20
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.930
Let's sorry to change the grouping on that 12 months,

21
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.600
for example,

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.020
when will the quarters here click?

23
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.520
OK,

24
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.620
could see here that they're both link.

25
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.390
So we're not able to create to pivot tables from the same data source with different

26
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.950
groupings,

27
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.770
at least using this way.

28
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.400
Actually,

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.990
there are work arounds to do it.

30
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.560
So the verse work around is to create a new workbook ears.

31
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
I'm gonna press control and end on the keyboard to create any workbook,

32
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.220
and then I'm gonna insert pivot table.

33
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.050
I'm gonna go get it from that data source here.

34
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.700
So I'm gonna go get it from this table and I'm gonna put it in an existing worksheet.

35
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.350
Let's put it here on this worksheet first and let's go to a new workbook here.

36
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.780
So,

37
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.590
as you can see here,

38
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.590
we've got a new workbook with a pivot table here that we just created has put the order

39
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.500
date on the world section and this Just remove these groupings here and let's put the sales

40
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.240
amount on the submission of value section.

41
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.270
You can see here This pivot table is now grouped by months.

42
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.980
Although it's from the same source,

43
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.850
it's actually not linked grouping wise to the other pivot tables.

44
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.190
I can select this pivot table here,

45
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.290
press control and X to cut it and then go to my other workbook here and press control envy

46
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.290
.

47
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.650
Now I can actually right click group And I can group by quarters,

48
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.120
for example,

49
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.280
on this one and easier.

50
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.000
When I changed 2/4 on this one,

51
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.220
it didn't change the other two.

52
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.630
So they actually are not linked at the moment,

53
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.120
although they come from the same data source.

54
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.040
So although this pivot table here comes from the same data source,

55
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.720
it has a different pivot cash.

56
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.110
Now,

57
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.110
another way to do it is to press olt d p on your keyboard and this will open the pivot

58
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.600
table and pivot chart wizard and is gonna ask you here,

59
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.710
Where is the data you want to analyze?

60
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.230
And it's actually in a Microsoft Excel list their database.

61
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.330
So I'm gonna click next year,

62
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.750
and then I'm gonna selecting migraines,

63
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.450
So I'm gonna select my data here.

64
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.130
This is my data,

65
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.660
and I'm gonna press next.

66
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.840
And here is giving me some sort of ah,

67
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.020
warning message of new report will use this memory if you base it on your existing report.

68
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.180
Pivot table seven,

69
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.540
which was created from the same data source.

70
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.680
Do you want your new report?

71
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.390
to be based on the same data as your existing report.

72
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.310
This means it's giving me the choice whether I would like the new pivot table to use the

73
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.780
same pivot cash or a different pivot gush.

74
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.340
In this case,

75
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.040
I actually wanted to use the different pivot gash.

76
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.590
So I'm gonna press no here so that they would have to separate pivot gushes.

77
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.700
So I'm gonna for snow.

78
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.260
And is it cause here it's giving me the option to put it in your work shit or an existing

79
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.670
worship?

80
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.650
I'm just gonna put in existing worshipped here,

81
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.430
put it in this cell and then press finish.

82
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.660
And now I am going to put the order date here on the road section.

83
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.800
I'm gonna move any grouping and do the grouping again by myself.

84
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.470
Gonna put the sales amount here and let's do a different grouping here.

85
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.280
So group by,

86
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.420
let's say,

87
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.070
by days,

88
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.050
year and by months,

89
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.750
and click OK here,

90
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.630
Cizikas here.

91
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.730
I managed to group this pivot table with a different grouping and it didn't affect the

92
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.370
other pivot tables because it's using a separate pivot cash.

93
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.160
It says you can see here two ways to get around grouping pivot tables from the same data

94
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.650
source,

95
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.410
since if you do it just the straightforward way it will use the same pivot cash and the

96
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.550
grouping will be linked.

97
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.690
But as you can see here,

98
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.650
we showed two ways to get around that.

99
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.770
So that's that guy's for grouping credit tables from the same data source.

100
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.660
Thanks so much for watching this video.

101
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.850
I'll see you on the next one.
