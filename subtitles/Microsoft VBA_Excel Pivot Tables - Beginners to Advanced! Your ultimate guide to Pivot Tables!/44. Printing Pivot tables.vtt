00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
if you need to print your pivot table,

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.710
Where you need to do is to select your whole pivot table by selecting a cell inside your

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.830
pivot table and then going to the analyze tab on the ribbon and then under the select

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.240
option.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360
Here you click entire pivot table.

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.550
You got to select the entire pivot table,

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.690
and then you go to the page layout tab under the ribbon here,

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.250
and then you select your print area.

9
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.190
So you click on print area and then set print area,

10
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.850
and now you're print area is set to be the pivot table.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.310
And now,

12
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.240
if you go to file and then print and consider that our pivot table is set to be printed

13
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.570
here.

14
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.710
So if you press print,

15
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.210
your printer should print your pivot table.

16
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.600
If you need to separate your pivot table into multiple pages,

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.440
what you need to do is to select the road that you need to have a separation on.

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.570
So in our case here,

19
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.770
it's gonna be girl having the year 2017 for example.

20
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.490
So we want 2016 to be on a page and then 2017 to be on the following page.

21
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.960
So I'm going to select the road here for 2017 and then under the page layout top here,

22
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.560
we're going to select breaks and an insert page break sickens.

23
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.820
Here there is ah ah,

24
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.580
line that's been inserted.

25
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.900
Here it's This is a page break,

26
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.420
and this will break your printing area.

27
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.120
And now you've got to select your pivot table again and go to the anal.

28
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.090
I stub on the ribbon and then select entire pivot table,

29
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.170
and then you gotta go again to the print command.

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.340
You can either do it through the file menu as well done before you compress control and P

31
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.320
on your keyboard.

32
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.040
As you can see here now,

33
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.230
2016 is going to be a printed on the first page on.

34
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.650
Then,

35
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.330
if we scroll to the next page,

36
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.430
you can see here we get 2017.

37
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.320
It's gonna be printed on the following page.

38
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.350
So this is how you can print your pivot table and how you can also separate you pivot table

39
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.610
or split it into multiple pages.

40
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.600
If you have more years,

41
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.200
for example,

42
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.600
you can insert multiple page breaks
