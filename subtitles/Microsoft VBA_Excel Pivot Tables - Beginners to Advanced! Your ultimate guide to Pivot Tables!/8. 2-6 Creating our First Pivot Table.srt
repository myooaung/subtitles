1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Okay,

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,240
so that's speak a bit about the layout and structure of a pivot table.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,250
So as we agreed before,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,210
the best thing to do when creating a pivot table is to first grade a table from our data.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,250
So with greater the table here from our data and to insert a pivot table,

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,440
we've seen that multiple times on the course.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,680
But let's do it one more time here so you can actually go to the insert and then pivot

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,360
table here,

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,810
or you can go to design.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,260
And there is another option,

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,550
actually,

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,790
for inserting a pivot table,

13
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,700
which is summaries with pivot table.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,060
So either of those would work says you can see here Excel managed to highlight all of our

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,500
data automatically inside the table.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,190
So we're gonna insert a pivot table on you,

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,900
worksheet.

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,730
We're going to click.

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,290
Okay,

20
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,950
here and now we've created our pivot table.

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,440
Now,

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,300
as you can see here,

23
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,350
we've got our pivot table tools at the top while we are inside our pivot table.

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,770
But if we step outside our pivot table,

25
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,910
you can see here that the two tops under the pivot table tools have disappeared.

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,570
So in order to view these two tubs,

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,120
which are the analyzing designed top you need to be inside your pivot table.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,250
You can actually also change the name of your pivot table.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,650
So here are Pivot Table has a name pivot table one.

30
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,510
We can actually change its name.

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,830
I'd like to give my pivot tables a prefects,

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,130
which is PVT so PVT.

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,290
We can call it PVT.

34
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:23,860
Sales,

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,560
for example.

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,200
And now with changed the name of our pivot table on the right hand side with our pivot

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,650
table field Spain.

38
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,530
And this is where we get to manipulate and play with the fields of our pivot table.

39
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,870
And you can actually show or hide the pivot table fields by stepping inside your pivot

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,160
table.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,530
First,

42
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,280
they need to select a cell inside your pivot table and then here under the analyze tab on

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,750
the ribbon.

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,740
There is a few list button here so you can toggle between the pivot table fields,

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,240
appearing and disappearing using that button.

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,270
Now let's explain the anatomy or the structure of a pivot table.

47
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,900
So on a pivot table,

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,960
we've got four areas that weaken drag fields into them.

49
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,070
So we've got the filter's area we've got the columns area,

50
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,870
We got the rails area and we've got the submission of values area or the values area.

51
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,310
So basically,

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,210
any feels that we drag into the filter's area will be on the top left corner of our pivot

53
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,630
table,

54
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:33,210
and any feels we dragged to the columns area will be on the horizontal area over pivot

55
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,350
table at the top.

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,480
They will be laid out horizontally,

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,860
and any feels that we put in the Rose area will be on the left hand side of our pivot table

58
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:44,860
,

59
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,950
and any feels that we put in the values area will be in the middle off the pivot table.

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,730
Now,

61
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,890
let's create a quick pivot table here out of our data.

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,750
So I'm gonna put the customer field here on the filters and I'm gonna put the year on the

63
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,560
columns.

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm gonna put this sales person field in the row section and I'm gonna put the sales

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,550
amounts in the submission of value section.

66
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,420
So there you go.

67
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,300
We've created our first pivot table,

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,230
and in future videos,

69
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,350
we're gonna learn more about manipulating our pivot tables
