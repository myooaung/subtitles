1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
Okay,

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,680
Now we're going to create a calculated field from another calculated field.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,740
So we've got a pivot table here,

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,160
and we've already got a calculated feed,

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,890
which is the cost of goods sold its named here on the pivot table fields.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,600
Cal cost good sold,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,820
and we've given it a title here of Astra's cost of a good soldier that he wouldn't have the

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,900
some off prefix.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,140
And now we want to create another calculated field,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,420
the school sales margin to calculate the sales margin,

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,940
which is basically one minus the cost of goods sold.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,450
So to do that,

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,500
we're going to select our pivot table here and then go to pivot table,

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,730
analyze top here and then go to feels,

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,740
items and sets,

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,270
click on calculated field,

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,850
and then I'm gonna call it talc sales margin,

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,810
for example,

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:57,040
And then the formula is gonna be one minus the Cal cost of goods sold year and click OK,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,760
and as you can see your it's created the calculated field.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,320
However,

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,580
we need to change the number format,

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,630
so I'm going to select the whole column here,

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,310
and then I'm gonna click control and one to get the number formats here and then go to

25
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,320
percentage.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,940
And here we're going to set a percentage and with no decimal places,

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,240
click.

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,640
Okay,

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,750
Here and now we have changed the number formatting for it to be a percentage.

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:31,000
So this is basically how you can create a calculated field from another calculated field on

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,470
Of course,

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,620
you can change its name here,

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,310
click on the field itself value field settings.

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,200
So it's a change its title here.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,480
So we can put Asterix sales margin for example,

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,300
and click OK here so that we wouldn't have this some off prefix here and we would have

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,720
something denoting that.

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,340
This is a calculated field,

40
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,810
which is the asterisk before the name of the calculated field.

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:03,270
So this is basically how you can create a calculated field from another calculated field.

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,250
So thanks for watching this video you see on the next one
