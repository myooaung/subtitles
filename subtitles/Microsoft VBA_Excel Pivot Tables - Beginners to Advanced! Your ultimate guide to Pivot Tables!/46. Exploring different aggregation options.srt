1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
and this video,

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,890
we're going to go through the different aggregation options that are available in pivot

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,410
tables says You can see here we get a simple pivot table where we got the year and then

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,120
it's broken down by months,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,920
and we've got the sales amount for each year and for each month as well.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,950
So you can see here that the aggregation that we've done is the summation.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,840
So we summed up the sales amount,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,760
but we can do other types of aggregation as well.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,980
So to do another type of aggregation on the sales amount,

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,740
for example,

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,570
where you need to do is to drag your field here.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,660
Which anarchists is gonna be the sales amount.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,110
We're going to drag it again to the submission of Value Section,

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,330
and then we can click on the field itself and then go to value field settings and you can

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,790
see here we've got other options.

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,200
So summaries values value field by other options other than the sum weaken do count,

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,990
for example.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,360
And if I click OK,

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,750
this gives us the count of rows for that particular item.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,140
So here in January 2016 we've got eight rows Now,

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,530
if you check our data set and that filter for 2016 end for January,

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,450
he can see here that we've got eight rows.

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,790
I'm going to remove my filters,

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,820
you but pressing control and see twice on my keyboard.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,410
And then I'm gonna go back to my pivot table and then let's explore mawr aggregation

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,890
options.

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,330
You can also go to the aggregation options.

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,280
Another way to do it is by right clicking here and then summarize values by Nicosia.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,510
You've got some options and you can also more options for the full list here so we can do

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,360
average as well.

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,790
On this will give you the average sales instead of the count of number of sales.

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,240
And then we can also do the max here,

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,240
and the max will give you the amount on the transaction that contained the maximum sale.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,810
So here in 2016 January,

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,960
we filter again here.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,050
By 2016 and January,

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:58,940
he can see air that the maximum sales him out on a particular transaction was 94,605 which

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,940
is the same amount that we've got here.

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,830
You could also choose minimum instead of maximum,

40
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,240
which will give you the amount on the transaction that contained the minimum sale.

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,250
And if we go to more options as well,

42
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,120
we've got here product which will basically multiply the amounts of all the sales

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,330
transactions that happened in January.

44
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,750
So we select product.

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,450
It will give us a very big number,

46
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,600
and this number is basically the result of multiplying all these sales amounts by each

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,980
other.

48
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,700
So if you go back to our pivot table on,

49
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,310
if we explore more options that we got here to go to more options,

50
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,720
we've got also standard deviation for the simple and then for the population and variants

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,680
for the simple and for the population.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,740
The other option that you need to highlight here is the count numbers and count numbers

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,370
will count on Lee the cells that contain numbers.

54
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,740
So,

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,340
for example,

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,360
here in January,

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
we've got the count numbers.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,920
It's eight and it's equal to the count because account will count both Dexter numbers.

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,060
But count numbers will only count numbers.

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,750
But all the values here are numbers actually on the sales amount.

61
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,510
But if we replace one value,

62
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,870
for example by text here just any kind of text.

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,270
And if we remove the filters here and then refresh our pivot table.

64
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,550
So now we've got a value.

65
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,840
On January 2000 and 16 there is a text,

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,820
so the count numbers should be seven.

67
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,920
As you can see here,

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,320
it's become just a seven.

69
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,820
So this is a useful option.

70
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,200
If you need toe on Lee,

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,430
count the cells that contain numbers.

72
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,700
Okay,

73
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:27,920
guys.

74
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,640
So that's it.

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,050
That was a quick tour through the different aggregation options that we got here on the

76
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,100
value field settings.

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,470
Thank you very much watching I'll see on the next one.
