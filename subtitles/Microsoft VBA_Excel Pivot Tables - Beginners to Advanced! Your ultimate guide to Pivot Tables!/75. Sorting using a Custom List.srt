1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He could also sort your pivot tables according to a custom list.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,980
So here I've got my pivot table here where I have the region on the road section and we get

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,370
the submission sales amount here on submission of value section.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,820
Now,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,770
as you can see here,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,800
the region field is sorted in ascending order alphabetically.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,950
So America's comes first Australia and then Europe.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,850
Now let's say I want to change the order here so that I'd have America's first and then

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,050
Europe and then Australia.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,470
So to do this,

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,790
I need to create a custom list.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,930
And to do that,

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,890
I'm just gonna put the names of my regions here in a list.

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,690
Just gonna copy and then paste values like this greater list.

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,440
So Australia is gonna be in the third position here,

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,410
and Europe is going to be in this second position.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,980
So this is my custom list that is not sorted in ascending order alphabetically,

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,610
it's just sorted according to my liking.

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,170
Now,

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,100
I need to create a custom list out of this list.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,650
So to do that,

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm gonna go to file,

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,450
I'm going to go to options,

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,260
and then I'm gonna go to advanced here,

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,290
and I'm going to scroll down to the general section under advance.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,300
So here's the general section.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,350
I'm going to click on Edit Custom lists here,

28
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,520
and then I'm going to create a new list and my new list is gonna be from the cells,

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,790
and then I'm going to click on import to import menu list.

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,870
Here is my new list.

31
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,770
My custom list.

32
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,390
I'm gonna click,

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:39,960
Okay?

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,530
And then I'm gonna click OK,

35
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:41,940
again.

36
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,980
So now I have my customer list created now to apply this custom missed.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,350
You can just right click here on a pivot table and then click on refresh.

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,020
And if it still doesn't get applied,

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,580
you can right click again and then sort a to Z.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,950
And you can see here that the custom list has been applied here.

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,590
So as you can see here,

42
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,400
we've got the Americas and the In Europe and in Australia,

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,200
the items here on the region field are sorted according to my custom list that I created.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,480
Now what happens if I sort in a descending order instead of an ascending order?

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,560
So right Click Sort sort Z to a he concedes it's sorted.

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,290
According to my custom list,

47
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,880
but in a descending order.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,290
So I have Australia here.

49
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,300
That was the bottom.

50
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,690
I got it.

51
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,890
I got it at the top.

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,170
And then America's years at the bottom in Europe is still in the middle,

53
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,960
so it basically inverted my custom list here.

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,470
Now,

55
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,180
if you refresh your pivot table and you've done sorting in ascending or descending order,

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,850
and you still find that your custom list is still not applied,

57
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,540
then what do you need to do is to right click here and then go to sort goto more sort

58
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,650
options and then click on more options here and make sure that this odor sort is sticked.

59
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,840
So make sure that this older sort check boxes checked sort automatically every time the

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
report is updated and click.

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,250
OK,

62
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,370
so that's it,

63
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,720
guys,

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,950
for sorting,

65
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,050
according to a custom list that you would great,

66
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,240
Thank you so much for watching this video I'll see on the next one
