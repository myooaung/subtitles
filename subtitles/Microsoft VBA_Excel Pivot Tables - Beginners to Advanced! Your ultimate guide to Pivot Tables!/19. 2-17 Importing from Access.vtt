Hey,

2
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.470
guys,

3
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome back on this video.

4
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.990
We're going to see how we can connect to an access database and create a pivot table out of

5
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.510
the data in the access database.

6
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.310
So let's say we have an access database year.

7
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.580
I'm just gonna double click on it and open it,

8
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.810
and it's got some data.

9
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.130
So here we've got a table that's called Data,

10
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.500
and it's got our data as usual.

11
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.750
And let's say you want to connect to this access database and create a pivot table out of

12
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.990
it so we can go in a workbook,

13
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.530
actually,

14
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.770
and we can go to the data tab on the ribbon here and click on from Access and then go to

15
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.770
the death stop here and then choose our access database and click open here and now we're

16
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.190
gonna be given the option to create either a table,

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.930
just a normal Excel table or a pivot table or pivot charts or only create a connection.

18
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660
We're going to choose pivot table here,

19
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.110
and you can choose the cell that you want to insert the pivot table on and do not check

20
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.200
this check box here,

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.260
which is at this data to the day tomato,

22
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.030
Because this way,

23
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.940
you be working with power pivot.

24
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.920
And that's a totally different story.

25
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.980
Totally different course.

26
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.180
So do not check this check box and then click.

27
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.710
OK,

28
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.000
here and now we have inserted a pivot table based on your data and weaken.

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.840
Start creating our pivot table here.

30
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.790
So I'm gonna put the product name on the rose section and put the sales amount,

31
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.350
for example,

32
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.720
in the submission value section.

33
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.330
And now I've created a pivot table based on my data in the access database.

34
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.480
And whenever the data and the access database cuts updated,

35
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.760
I can update this pivot table or refresh it by right clicking and then clicking on refresh

36
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.760
,

37
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.350
and it will update the values in my pivot table.

38
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.600
OK,

39
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.040
so this is how you can link a pivot table to an access database.

40
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.460
Thanks,

41
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.200
guys watching.

42
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.180
I'll see you on the next one
