00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
As you can see here,

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.840
I'm selecting my pivot table and I can't see the field list.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.320
All the reason for that is that the field list can actually be shown or hidden.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.270
And to do that,

5
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.950
you can go to the inn Ally,

6
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.460
stop here on the ribbon after selecting a cell inside your private table and then click on

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.500
field list here.

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.150
As you can see her,

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.650
this will show your field list,

10
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.630
and if you click again,

11
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.470
this will hide your field list.

12
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.290
Alternatively,

13
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.040
you can right click on your pivot table,

14
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.780
and then there is height field list.

15
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.120
Here.

16
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.840
You can click on that to hide the field list in the or right click and then show the field

17
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.210
list.

18
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
So as you can see where you can show on hide your fueled list on your pivot table.
