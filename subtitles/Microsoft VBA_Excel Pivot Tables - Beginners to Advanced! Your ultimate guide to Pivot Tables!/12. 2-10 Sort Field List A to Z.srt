this video,

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,200
I'm going to show you one of my favorite tips for dealing with Pivot table field.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,950
So actually it involves sorting.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,140
The pivot table feels alphabetically because it makes finding the pivot table feels so much

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,570
easier.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,710
So sometimes when you have a lot of feels when you have a table with lots of columns here,

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,090
you would have a long list even longer than this off pivot table fields.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,890
And if they are not sorted,

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,120
it's not gonna be easy to find them,

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,360
so you can easily sort them in an A to Z fashion by clicking on this gear icon here and

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,350
then clicking on sort HZ.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,670
Alternatively,

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,310
you can go to the analyzed tab on the ribbon click on options.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,450
Then you're gonna click on display here,

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,780
and then you're gonna have an option here for feel this sort eight easy and click.

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,110
OK does a very nice tip that you can use in order to sort your pivot table fuels in an A to

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,670
Z fashion or in ascending order so that you confined your fields easily
