00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
Okay,

2
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.710
so let's great another type of chart in this video.

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.730
And although I'm not a big fan off pie chart,

4
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.040
we're going to create a pie chart in this video.

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.290
And the reason I'm not a fan of pie charts is that they don't make it easier for you to

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.560
spot the differences in the values.

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.190
Actually,

8
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.860
the column and the bar charts make it much easier to spot the differences in values because

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.710
it's easier to spot the differences as differences in length on a column or a bar chart

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.720
than it is to spot the differences as differences in volumes,

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.070
or like the chunks or the parts of the picture.

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.250
And we will see that here in this example.

13
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.750
So I'm going to select a cell inside my pivot table here,

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.860
and I'm gonna go the insert tab on the ribbon and I'm gonna go here two pie charts and I'm

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380
gonna insert a pie chart.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.210
And is it sincere?

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.170
I've managed to insert a pie chart,

18
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.690
and it is clear that Europe has the biggest chunk of my sales on then.

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.090
Here I've got the Americas on Australia.

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.500
The Americas are a little bit higher than Australia.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.460
But it's not easy to put the difference between the Americans and the Australia on a pie

22
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.950
chart,

23
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.130
as it is easy to do it on a column or a bar chart,

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.000
you can see her.

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.210
Australia and America's are quite close.

26
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.920
Its 3,000,400 something on Australia and it's 4,000,700 something on America's on.

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.450
Although there is one almost a 1.3 1,000,000 a dollar difference,

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.310
it's not as easy to spot the difference between them.

29
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.680
But if you,

30
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.400
for example,

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.720
create a bar chart,

32
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.660
I'm going to go toe insert here and then create a bar chart.

33
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.560
You can see here that it's much easier to spot that America's is greater than Australia

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.000
when it comes to sales.

35
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.870
So I'm just gonna select here this column chart and I'm gonna delete it,

36
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.040
says Higgins Here,

37
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.360
it's not as easy to spot it as it is on the column chart,

38
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.190
but still,

39
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.550
this is a relatively good case to use a pie chart because also would use a pie chart.

40
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.160
Make sure that you don't have a lot of data.

41
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.050
Points are a lot of chunks to compare between them because then the pie chart gets really

42
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.650
messy,

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.820
and in that case you have to use a column or bar chart.

44
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.270
You can also explode the bar chart here and separate the different chunks of the pie chart

45
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.270
.

46
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.900
You could do that certainly,

47
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.620
and you can also combine them back.

48
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.860
I did that by pressing and holding my left most button and dragging away,

49
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.270
and then also pressing and holding my left bones most bun and dragging towards the center.

50
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.200
The pie chart will combine the parts back together again.
