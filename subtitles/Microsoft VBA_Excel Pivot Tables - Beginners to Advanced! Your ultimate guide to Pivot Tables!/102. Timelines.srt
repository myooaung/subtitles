1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
Now we're going to speak about timelines,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:11,160
So timelines are basically slicers that can only filter fields that have dates in them.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,260
So on this pivot table here,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,770
we've got the salesperson on the roads section and we've got the year on the columns

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,660
section and we've got the submission of sales amount on the submission of Value Section.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,870
And let's try to insert a timeline here So a timeline will help us filter this pivot table

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,890
by days or months or quarters or years.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,200
That's the flexibility and the beauty of a timeline.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,220
So I'm gonna go to the insert tab here on the ribbon after selecting his cell in my pivot

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,710
table.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:50,240
And then I'm going to click here on timeline and notice here that it only offers me when

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,880
field to use on my timeline,

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,350
which is the order date field because the ordered a field or the ordered A column Is the

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,660
Onley field a my data that has Onley dates in it.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,950
This is why this is the only field offer to me to create a timeline over.

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,190
So I'm gonna click,

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,760
OK,

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,820
here and here is my time light as it gets here.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
So this timeline allows me to filter my data by years for examples I six council ECT year

20
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,270
2019 and it would only show the 2019 data.

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,790
I can extend that to 2018 as well to show me 2018 and 2019 and then I can go to quarters

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,140
and econ filter my data by quarters.

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,540
So this is the first quarter of 2019.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:45,860
I can also do the fourth quarter 2018 in the first quarter of 2019 for example,

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,950
and I can select fourth quarter of 2019.

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,780
I can extend that as much as I like is against year.

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,060
So this offers a lot of flexibility for me to filter my data,

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,640
and it's,

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,970
ah,

30
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,460
pretty user friendly as well.

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,840
And then I can go to the my months here,

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,130
and it's because here it gives me the ability to filter by months.

33
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,050
As you can see here,

34
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,380
here,

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,530
here are the months and there.

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,960
There's also the year here,

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,550
so this is December 2018 but I can go into January 19 as well.

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,310
I can go back all the way to July 18.

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,910
So that's July 18th January 19 as you can see here,

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,730
or I can do it by the individual days,

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,140
Okay,

42
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,640
and you can also create styles and edit the styles,

43
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,150
and you can also choose a different style here.

44
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,460
For your timeline,

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,740
you can create a new style just the same way that we explained how to do it for slicers.

46
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,150
So it's basically a slicer,

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,960
but only four fields that have dates in them.

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,130
You can also change the connections.

49
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,870
So which,

50
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,450
ah,

51
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,550
pivot table that that timeline connects to.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,630
If you click here on report connections or if you right click here and go to a port

53
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,650
connections as well,

54
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,650
you can change which pivot table is connected to that particular timeline.

55
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,470
So it gets treated basically just like a slicer,

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:19,150
except for the fact that it could only be built upon fields that have dates on Lee in them

57
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,150
.

58
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,300
Okay,

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,650
so that's the timeline
