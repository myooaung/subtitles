1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
and this video,

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,440
we're going to discuss the difference from calculation.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,870
So the difference from calculation considers the difference of one value from another.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,920
And the other value could be the value for the sales,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,470
for example,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,190
on the previous month or on the previous year.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,370
So that's illustrate that with an example,

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:24,310
let's say I want to create a calculation here that would get me the difference between this

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,920
sales on a particular month and the sales on the previous month.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,450
So I'm gonna insert another instance here of the sales amount,

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,320
and then I'm going to click on it,

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,190
go to value field settings here and then go to show values as on.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,050
Instead of no calculation here,

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,350
I'm going to select difference from.

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,570
And as I said,

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,700
I want to create a calculation that would compare the sales on a particular month to the

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,090
sales on the month just before it.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,100
So we're going to select the base field here as the sales month,

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,060
and then we're going to select previous so that we can get the sales difference between the

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,350
current month and the previous month.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,660
And now I'm gonna rename this to difference between this month and previous month.

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,300
I'm gonna click OK here,

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,700
and as you can see here we get.

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,040
The results we get are the differences between the sales on the current month and the

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,890
previous month.

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,020
So,

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,580
for example,

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,230
here for February 2016 the sales was 29,549 and the bump previous to it,

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,160
which was January 2016.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:37,960
It's 330,000 181 because here there's a $300,000 difference between February 16 end and

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,270
January 16 and you can see what the difference is in negative because January was greater

32
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,300
than February.

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,100
So it's This is current month minus previous month and is because here for Marsh sales was

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,790
122,000 189 and February US 29,000.

35
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,600
So differences 92 thousands a positive difference because Marsh,

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,320
the sales on Marsh was greater than this sales on February 2016 and we can do a bit of

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,650
custom member formatting here.

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,760
It's a good practice.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,740
We can select the whole call him here,

40
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,040
press control and one on our keyboard to go to number formatting and the formatting is a

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,540
currency,

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,520
but we can actually color the negative numbers and red.

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,710
It's always a good practice so that we can easily distinguish the months where we had a

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,360
decline in sales so that they would stand out this way.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,650
So now we've calculated the difference between the current bond and the previous month.

46
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,880
We can also calculate difference between the cells on the current year and the previous

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,570
year is well.

48
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,570
So if we insert another instance here of the sales amount and then click on it,

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,480
go to value field settings and then go to show values as instead of no calculation,

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,020
we're going to select difference from.

51
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,500
And then the base field here is gonna be the year and we're going to select previous and

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,670
then difference.

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,080
Between this year and previous year,

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm gonna click,

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,510
OK,

56
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,750
and as you can see here,

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,650
we get the difference between this year and the previous year,

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,010
off course in 2016 because it's the earliest year on our data.

59
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,100
We don't have any data because we don't have a year on our data.

60
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,430
That is before 2016.

61
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,050
But here in 2017.

62
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,670
On January,

63
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,150
for example,

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,710
it's negative.

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,140
130,000,

66
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,550
880

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,270
So what does that mean?

68
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:30,030
That means that this is the difference between January 17 here and January 16.

69
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:39,350
So in January 17 the sales was 199,301 and in January 16 330,000 181.

70
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,160
So there was a decline of negative 130,000 880.

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,850
And this goes for February as well.

72
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,970
This is the difference.

73
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,000
150,803.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,560
So February 17 the sales wills 150,000 more than the sales in February 16.

75
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,740
We can also do the same thing here for this column.

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,590
Do some custom number formatting.

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,430
So Arkan selected press control,

78
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,340
run our keyboard,

79
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,640
and then we can select the red color for negative numbers so that they would stand out as

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,940
well.

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,210
This is a good practice.

82
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,290
So as you can see here,

83
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,030
we could do the difference between this month in the previous month or different stream

84
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,340
this year and previous year,

85
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,010
and we can do the differences well between this month and the following month.

86
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,470
Okay,

87
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,140
so you can do the same if you click on any of them.

88
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,070
Value field settings.

89
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,050
Years show values as instead of previous you select next.

90
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,840
You can do that as well,

91
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,430
and you can do the difference between a particular year and this year.

92
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,980
So you can select to do the difference between this year and 2016.

93
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,550
For example,

94
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,470
not the previous year,

95
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,850
just 2016 in particular.

96
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,420
If we had had more years than two years.

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,020
So if you had add three or four years of data would have been able to compare,

98
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,690
for example,

99
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,400
2016 to 2000 and 14 in particular,

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,050
for example,

101
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,190
and so on and so forth.

102
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,570
So press cancel here,

103
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,490
and then we're gonna have another example here for comparing to a particular item.

104
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,350
So as you can see here,

105
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,270
we've got a pivot table where we have the region,

106
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,140
and then it's broken down into the different products and weaken.

107
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,650
Compare all the regions to a particular reason so we can compare all the regions to the

108
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,400
Americas,

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,060
for example,

110
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,260
so we can insert another instance year of the submission of the sales amount,

111
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,930
click on it,

112
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,270
value fuel settings,

113
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,990
show values as and then we're gonna select difference from.

114
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,740
And then the base field here is gonna be the region,

115
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,410
and we're going to compare everything to the Americas.

116
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,650
So we're going to compare Australia to the Americas,

117
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,900
Europe to the Americas.

118
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,550
And of course,

119
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,860
Americans to the Americans will be a zero because they're the same thing.

120
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:50,060
So we're gonna create a field here named difference between this region and America's.

121
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,750
For example.

122
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,060
On we're going to click OK,

123
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,050
here says you can see here we get the difference between Australia,

124
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,770
for example,

125
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,740
and the Americas.

126
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,060
So in Australia the sales were 1,266,446.

127
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,650
And in America's they were one million,

128
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,480
474,967.

129
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,760
So we get a difference year of negative 208,521 and it goes the same as well on a product

130
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,210
level.

131
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,680
But here the sales for product one in Australia was greater than the sales for product one

132
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,630
in America's.

133
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,050
So the difference here is a positive difference.

134
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,300
279,554.

135
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,060
So we're now comparing to a particular region so you can compare to a particular item or a

136
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,210
particular value.

137
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,410
So you can compare to a particular value is well,

138
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,730
not on Lee two,

139
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,850
previous or next.

140
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,100
Great.

141
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,710
So that's it,

142
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,040
guys,

143
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,930
for the difference from calculation.

144
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one.
