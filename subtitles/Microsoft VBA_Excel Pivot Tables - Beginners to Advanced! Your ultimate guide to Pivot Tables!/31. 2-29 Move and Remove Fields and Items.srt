1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
and this video,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,100
we're going to speak about moving and shifting around fields on items in our pivot tables.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,280
So when it comes to items,

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,170
we can actually move on item from one position to another in a pivot table.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,850
So here,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,420
for example,

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,770
for product to which is an item under the product name field.

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,950
It's not the first item here on the field.

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,330
You can see here that first item here is product one,

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,700
but we can actually move product to to replace product one here and become the first item

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,860
on the product name field.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,460
And to do that,

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,290
you can just click on product to here and then hover over the corner for product.

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,960
Two year until you get this foresighted arrow.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,530
Click and drag upwards here to replace product one.

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,660
And as you can see here,

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,520
we managed to replace product one with product to and product to is now the first item on

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,660
the product name field.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,530
I'll press Control and Z on the keyboard toe.

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,420
Undo that,

21
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,790
and alternatively,

22
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,860
you can also click here on product one,

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,680
and then you can type product to instead,

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,660
and this will replace product one here with product to and product who becomes the first

25
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,550
item here.

26
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:05,790
Ah,

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,980
press control NZ to undo that and then you can also do the same thing with the year.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,510
So here we've got 2017 is the first year we can make 2016 the first year here.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,300
Or we can put back 2017 to be the first year normally,

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,130
but default.

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,780
You should have 2000 and 16 as the first year here.

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,650
You have other options as well,

33
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,920
so you can move around on item label by right,

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,040
clicking on it here.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,050
And then there is a move option here,

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,320
and then you can move it one step down.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,200
So move product one down will move it.

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,490
One step down here to replace product to,

39
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,830
or you can also move it to the end.

40
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,220
And that means that you will go down to the very bottom here,

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,620
and when it's at the very bottom,

42
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,050
you will have an option here,

43
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,080
move it to the beginning or move it up.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,450
So up one step or to the very beginning,

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,410
to put it back here to the very top position,

46
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,450
you get the idea,

47
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,790
and if we explore the move option more right click move.

48
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,640
Here you can see air more product name to the right or to end,

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,160
and this will basically move the field.

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,750
Either one step down or to the very end here on the roads section.

51
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,080
Or you can also move it to the column section.

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,510
So if you click on this move product name to the right,

53
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,480
this will move it one step down on the roast sections.

54
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,400
As you can see here and now,

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,100
it's sales person than product name.

56
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,970
And if there had been three fields,

57
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,840
we would have been able to notice here the end option.

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
But you know the end option.

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,320
We've got only two fields.

60
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,660
But if you add 1/3 field the quarter,

61
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,430
for example,

62
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,420
we can make the product name field.

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:36,920
For example,

64
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,680
if you used the end option here,

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,580
we can make it at the very bottom field here.

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,870
You can also use this Rosen column section as well to move around fields,

67
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,950
and this is much easier even.

68
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,120
And of course,

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,010
you can move items fields from the rose section to the column section.

70
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,540
This way.

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,730
So basically,

72
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:03,560
this has been a demonstration on how to move and shift around fields on items in our pivot

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,820
table.

74
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,210
So thanks so much watching,

75
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,050
I'll see on the next.
