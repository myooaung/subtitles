00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
in this video,

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,020
we're going to discuss the filtration of numerical text values or alpha numeric values.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,330
So here on our data set,

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,710
we've got a column.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,920
They school the item number,

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,530
and this column consists of a mix of numbers and text.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,430
So here you can see the item number.

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,920
For example,

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,110
101 Tripoli and the force of from four DF.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,390
So this is basically a mix of numbers and alphabets,

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,960
so this could be an item number.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,070
It could be a barcode.

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,450
It could be anything.

14
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,890
So I'm gonna go here to my pivot tab and you could see her.

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,990
We've got a pivot table,

16
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,290
get the item number on the world section and the summer sales amount on this emission of

17
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,070
value section.

18
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,550
And to filter that,

19
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,240
we're gonna filter using the label fitters.

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,550
And we're going to use these options here greater than grid unequal to less than less than

21
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,550
or equal to between and not between.

22
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,020
So that's sorry,

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,000
the greater than option,

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,800
for example here.

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,650
So I'm gonna filter for anything greater than 10 to triple A and let's see what we get.

26
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,280
In the result,

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,450
click OK here and is it sincere.

28
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:05,300
We got all the item numbers that start with numbers greater than 102 But we also got 102

29
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,450
triple Z.

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,840
So why is that?

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,110
This is because it filters for numbers,

32
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,020
and it also filters using the alphabet.

33
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,770
So because the Triple Z's in the alphabet are considered higher values in the alphabet,

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,020
right,

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,680
because Z letter is a later letter than the A letter,

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,300
right,

37
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,510
so it's considered of a higher value.

38
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,290
So it's filtered for that as well,

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,350
on the greater that.

40
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,590
So it filters for both numbers and texts.

41
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,620
So this is a great way to filter Alfa and numerical values.

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,640
And of course,

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,830
the same applies to all the other options year.

44
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,990
So this is gonna be greater than or equal to say will include the window to Triple A.

45
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,920
They use that less than less than or equal to between between two values and not between

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
two values.

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,750
So as you can see her,

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,710
the idea here is that if filters using both numbers and alphabets,

49
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,750
so it considers both the numbers and the letters in its filters,

50
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,160
that's it.

51
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,430
Guys for alpha and numeric filters or numerical text value filters.

52
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,450
Thank you so much for watching this video I'll see on the next one
