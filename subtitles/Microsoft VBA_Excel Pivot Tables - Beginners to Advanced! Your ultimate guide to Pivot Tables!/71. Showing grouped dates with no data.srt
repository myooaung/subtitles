1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
We've got this pivot table here where we have the order date on the world section and we

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,590
get the summer sales amount on the submission of Value Section.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,770
And let's say that we group these dates here by 70.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,950
So we right click,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,060
go to group and then we select a zier and we select the number of these to be seven,

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,840
and we click.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,430
OK,

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,930
so you will notice here that there are some weeks the are missing.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,490
So,

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,150
for example,

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,700
here the week from 27th of March 2016 up until the second of April,

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,670
2016 it's missing.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,240
And the reason that it's missing is that we don't have any transactions happening on the

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,330
dates of this particular week.

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,940
So in order to show missing data here,

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,500
we can actually go to our field here.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,290
So click on it,

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,540
go to feel settings,

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,770
and then we can go to layout and print,

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,500
and then we take here,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,220
show items with no data,

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,030
and we click.

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,450
OK,

24
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:53,800
here.

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,910
So now we're gonna be able to show the items with no data.

26
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,210
Another way to get to that.

27
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,550
You can right click here and then go to feel settings Goto Leo in print and we get to the

28
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,110
same option here.

29
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,480
So we managed now to show the items with no data.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,610
We could also show zeros on these items since they don't have any sales.

31
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,960
So we might as well display them a zero.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,210
We could right click here,

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,010
go to pivot table options and that for empty cells show a zero and click.

34
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,650
OK,

35
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,690
so there you go.

36
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,420
This is how you can show items on a field with no data.

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
So there you go.

38
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,950
This is how you can show items on a field with the data and also replace the missing values

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,890
with zeros,

40
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,570
for example,

41
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,720
or any other value that you would like.
