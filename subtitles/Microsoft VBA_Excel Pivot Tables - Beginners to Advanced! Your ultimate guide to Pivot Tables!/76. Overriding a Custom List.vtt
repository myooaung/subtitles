00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's say that I need to override my custom list.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.660
So I created a custom nist previously where I sorted the regions in a non alphabetical

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.730
order there just sorted according to my liking according to accustom list I created.

4
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.350
So I've got America's in Europe and in Australia.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.200
Now let's say I don't want them to be sorted this way.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.860
I'm actually gonna copy my pivot table here,

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.340
Control,

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.370
see of the control V to paste it.

9
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.400
And basically,

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.200
let's say I want them to be sorted in an alphabetical order as usual.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.330
So I'm going to right click here and then go to pivot table options.

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.710
And then I'm going to go to totals and filters.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.350
And then I'm going to click on use custom.

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.370
This one sorting,

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm gonna untech that I'm gonna uncheck that and then I'm gonna click.

16
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.990
OK,

17
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.150
so as you can see here on the second pivot table that we applied this change on because

18
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.250
here that the list on it has been sorted alphabetically as usual,

19
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.990
it's been sorted in ascending order alphabetically instead of in ascending order according

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.720
to the custom list.

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.250
This is how we can override a custom list
