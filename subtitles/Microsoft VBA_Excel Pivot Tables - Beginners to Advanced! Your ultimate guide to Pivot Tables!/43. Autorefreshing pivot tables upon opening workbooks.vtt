00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
Let's say that you have a workbook that has its data source in a different server,

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.620
for example,

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.440
or that this workbook is a shared workbook between you and your colleagues,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.860
and you need to make sure to refresh the pivot table on it whenever you open the workbook.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.240
So whenever you open the workbook,

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.960
you refresh it manually by right clicking and then clicking on refresh.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.370
Well,

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.470
this could make you prone to forgetting to refresh the workbook,

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.840
right?

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.950
So what you can do is that you can make the pivot table get refreshed automatically

11
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.040
whenever you open the workbook.

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.770
And to do that,

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.950
you can right click on the pivot table and then go to pivot table options and then go to

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.070
the data top here.

15
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.160
And then there is an option.

16
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.250
He refresh data when opening the file.

17
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.280
If you check the option and press OK,

18
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.140
your data will be refreshed whenever your workbook is opened.

19
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.350
So this is how you can refresh your data automatically whenever you open your workbook.
