00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
So let's speak about sorting in pivot tables.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,010
So to do your basic sorting and pivot tables in ascending or descending order,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,080
there are multiple ways to achieve that.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,190
So the first way is that if you need to start a certain field,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,690
you could go here to the pivot table fields and click on this arrow here and then sort,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,750
for example,

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,020
a to Z or Z two A's so by ascending or descending orders.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,260
So if you click A to Z here,

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,120
you're going to sort in ascending order,

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,710
and you could look Z to a You're gonna sort in descending order or searching the product

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,720
names so you can see your product for Comes first.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,680
Now when sorting in descending order and then product three,

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,460
etcetera,

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,100
etcetera.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,160
Another way to do it is to make sure you select a cell in the field that you need to sort,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,040
and then you can right click and click on sort here and sort eight z or Z to a.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,320
So put it back to an A to Z sort here and 1/3 way to do it,

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,710
as well as to go to the data time on the ribbon well,

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,600
selecting a cell inside the field that you need to sort and then you consort using thes two

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,370
buttons here,

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,150
so a to Z or Z to a You can also certainly aggregated field here the submission of sales

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,540
amount.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,730
But you can't sort it.

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,150
Using the pivot table feels here using this arrow here.

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,890
He won't give you the option to sort.

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,560
But you can use the other two ways.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,820
Right?

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,840
Click sort,

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,400
so largest to smallest,

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,090
for example,

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,080
or you consort using the data time on the ribbon A to Z.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,270
This is smallest to largest as well as you can see here.

33
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,730
We're now sorting by the values in our aggregated field,

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,450
which is the submission of sales amount.

35
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,200
You could also sort to subtitles the same way,

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,700
right?

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,600
Click sort.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,990
And you could also use data time on the ribbon to sort in ascending or descending order.

39
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,530
So if I sort for example,

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,820
but in descending order here,

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,470
you can see her.

42
00:01:53,470 --> 00:02:00,760
We're sorting now by our sub total on the quarter says you can see here we have the high

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,930
scooter in terms of sales at the top and then the next one and then the next one,

44
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,680
etcetera,

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,280
etcetera.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,200
Okay,

47
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,430
guys.

48
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,860
So that's it for the basic sorting in pivot tables will be discussing Mawr advanced sorting

49
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,290
in the upcoming videos.

50
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,990
Thank you so much for watching I'll see on the next one.
