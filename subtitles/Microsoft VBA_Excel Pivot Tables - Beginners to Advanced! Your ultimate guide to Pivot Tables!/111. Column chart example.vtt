00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
Okay,

2
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.400
so let's have ah practical example here for creating a pivot.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.660
Sure.

4
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.500
So here I've got a pivot table having our sales people here in the rose section,

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.480
and I've got our sales amount in the Submission of value section.

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.880
So I'm going to create a pivot charts here,

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.860
a column chart that shows the sales for each sales persons.

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.870
And this is gonna be useful for comparing the sales of each sales person so that we know

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.290
who is the top achiever in the salespeople.

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
So I'm just going to select a cell here inside my pivot chart.

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.920
I'm going to go to the insert tab on the ribbon and that I'm going to go here,

12
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.570
too.

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.050
The column charts,

14
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.450
and I'm going to select a clustered column chart.

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.780
And as you can see here,

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.570
this chart can compare between the sales people's sales amounts and I can just name this

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.620
chart sales pair sales person.

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.800
Another thing I can do to make this chart even easier to read is to actually sort the sales

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920
amounts here in descending order.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.120
So I'm going to select a cell here inside my pivot table.

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.510
Go to the data top on the ribbon on.

22
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.100
Then I'm gonna select here to sort largest to smallest.

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.850
And this will make the chart evening easier for me to read.

24
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.990
I can also show the data labels here.

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.190
Add the data labels.

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.720
So now I've added the data labels to show how much each sales person has made sales for.

27
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.880
And I'm gonna also delete this legend as I don't need it because it's obvious that these

28
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.350
columns and these figures are for sales.

29
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.570
Okay,

30
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.330
so this is a simple pivot chart that I managed to create.

31
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.890
I managed to customize that pivot chart it to be even clearer and easier to read.

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.480
I can even remove these grid lines here so I can click on them and pressed the delete

33
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.100
button on the keyboard to make the chart easier to read.

34
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.340
And also,

35
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.120
I'm going to be able to do more customization,

36
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.220
even to my chart.

37
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.640
If a click on this plus by in here,

38
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.080
I can add stuff.

39
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.260
I can add access titles.

40
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.840
I can I titles to the axes.

41
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.670
I can add data labels.

42
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.740
I can create a data table below the charts.

43
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.550
As you can see here,

44
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.950
here's the data table created below the chart,

45
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.770
and he shows the amount off sales for each sales person on it can add error bars.

46
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.280
I can add some grid lines.

47
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.620
I can add more grid lines.

48
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.730
I removed the grid lines,

49
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.550
but I can add them.

50
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.680
We add them again here,

51
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.980
I can add the legend and I can add a trend line as well.

52
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.910
And this feature your being able to customize your charts through these two buttons here

53
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.760
has been added since Excel 2013.

54
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.770
I can also hear change the colors and the styles of the charts.

55
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.390
I can change styles year,

56
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.890
and I can also change the colors here off the short the color scheme.

57
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.070
And I can do the same thing.

58
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.220
If I click here on the pivot chart itself and then go to the design tab here on the ribbon

59
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.220
,

60
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.820
I will have the same options.

61
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.270
Change the colors,

62
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.170
change the styles as well.

63
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.260
The chart styles and I can also add chart elements from here.

64
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.700
Just like what we were doing here with the plus button,

65
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.500
I can also hear change the layouts off the charts.

66
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.400
Give it a quick one of those quick templates layouts.

67
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.020
So,

68
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.690
as you consider,

69
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.350
it's very easy to customize your pivot charts here.

70
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.190
And also,

71
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.590
one more tip for you is that if you need to customize any element on your pivot chart,

72
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.260
just select that element and then press control and one on your keyboard control,

73
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.460
and one is your friend here.

74
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.280
When it comes to customizing elements on your pivot chart and even on the normal charts

75
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.480
when you press control and one it will,

76
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.840
it will show here the options for customizing the elements here on the right hand side so

77
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.960
you can see here you can customize the fill color.

78
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.920
You can customize the effects on the bars themselves,

79
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.030
and you can customize.

80
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.540
Also,

81
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.280
the Siri's options here can customize the overlapping and the gap with,

82
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.350
so you can easily customize any element here by selecting the element impressing control on

83
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.280
one on your keyboard.

84
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.570
So if I press controlling one after selecting the data labels here,

85
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.300
I press control,

86
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.080
and when you can see her,

87
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.480
I'll get the options for the data labels so controlled one.

88
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.620
After you select any element on your pivot chart takes use trade away to the options for

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.760
customizing that particular element
