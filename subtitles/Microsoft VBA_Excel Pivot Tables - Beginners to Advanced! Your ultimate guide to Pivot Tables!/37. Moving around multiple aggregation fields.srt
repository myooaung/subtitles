00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,430
Hey,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:01,700
guys,

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,440
welcome back.

4
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,550
So in this video,

5
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,690
we're going to show a nice tip that you can use when you have more than one field in the

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,850
values area to Currently we have only one field,

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,320
which is the sum of sales.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,960
So that's at another field to the value section.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,770
And let's make the aggregation be the count for the sake of argument.

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,930
So I'm just going to drag the sales amount here to the submission of Value Section,

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,710
and I'm gonna change the aggregation on it.

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,820
So I'm gonna left click on it and then value field settings.

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,670
And then I'm going to select count instead of some and then press OK year because here that

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,940
we now have two aggregation fields.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,510
But you can see here as well that we have an extra field that's appeared here on the world

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,970
section,

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,430
which is the Sigma Values field.

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,820
And this field allows you to move multiple aggregation feels at once.

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,410
So actually,

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,630
this field here,

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,760
the signal values feel with all hours to move the sum of sales and count of sales both at

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,610
the same time,

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,770
so I can actually move it to the column section and because here the view has changed.

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,300
And we've got actually our aggregation fields here stacked across the columns.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,610
And if we move it back,

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,150
you can see her.

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,710
The view that we've got here,

28
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,220
which is that each sales person has a breakdown by the some of sales amount and account of

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,950
sales amount.

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,700
And we can also move it above the sales person.

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,640
And in this case,

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,300
we're gonna have a breakdown for each aggregation.

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,100
So there's some and account.

34
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,370
We're gonna have it broken down by the else person.

35
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,520
So that is a nice small tip for you here,

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,480
which is that you can move multiple aggregation feels at once using this submission of

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,180
values field that appears when you have multiple aggregation.

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,220
Feels so.

39
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,510
Thanks,

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,260
guys watching.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,450
I'll see on the next one.
