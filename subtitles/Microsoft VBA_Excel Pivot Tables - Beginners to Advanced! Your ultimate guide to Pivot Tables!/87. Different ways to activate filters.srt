00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
in this video,

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,040
we're going to show different ways or shortcuts to apply filters to your pivot tables.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,600
So the first way is using the pivot table feels,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,960
and you can show or unshowy Oh,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,290
the pivot table fields,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,420
talk of them on and off.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,800
If you click on the analyze time on the ribbon here and then this button here feel list,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,210
I can show or hide the field this on the pivot tables.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,620
So if you click on any arrow here on the pivot table fields,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,670
you can see here that you're able to do filters and the filter options you will see here

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,430
are going to depend on the type of values here that we have on the field.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,820
So on the sales amount,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,780
we've got some numbers,

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,180
right?

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,600
But if you click here on the order date,

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
which is a field that contained states,

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,480
you can see here we've got date filters instead of label food.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,780
So the type of filters that you're gonna be able to apply are gonna be dependent on the

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,060
data type of that particular field.

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,280
The second way to create filters is to right click on a pivot table field here on the pivot

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,780
table.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,810
So I'm bright clicking on the retailer field and you can see her.

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,450
We've gets infiltration options,

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,290
and I want to show you these two options here.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,170
Keep on Lee selected items and height selected items.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,520
So,

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,150
for example,

28
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,450
if I highlight the 1st 3 supermarkets here and right click and then go to Filter,

29
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,760
I can keep on Lee the selected items so I can keep only these three supermarkets press

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,550
control NZ to undo my filter.

31
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,200
Annika.

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,590
Also right click go to Filter and then hide the selected items so I'll keep all the other

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,600
supermarkets and hide these items says you can see here these air some extra filtration

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,840
options that we had not discussed before my first control NZ here again to undo all my

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,380
filters.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,240
And then the third way is the way that we were easing before using the pivot table headers

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,640
here.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,060
So this header here you click on it and you can start applying your filters.

39
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,630
And if you can't see this header for any reason you go to the inner life,

40
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,800
stop here and because here it we've got a button here for tumbling on and off the field

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,270
headers.

42
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,680
So if you click on that button,

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,790
it doubles it off.

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,800
Click on it again.

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,030
It doubles on.

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,470
Okay,

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,750
so these were different ways that we can apply filters to our pivot tables.
