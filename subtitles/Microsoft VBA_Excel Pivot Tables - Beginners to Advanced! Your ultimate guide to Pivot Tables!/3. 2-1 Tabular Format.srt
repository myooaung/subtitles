1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
Okay,

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,380
So before creating our pivot table,

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,940
we need to make sure of three things.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,150
Number one is the Our data is in a tabular format.

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,410
Number two is that we do not have any gaps in our data.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,100
And number three is that we form it our data properly.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,980
In this video,

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,230
we're going to speak about having our data in a tabular format.

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,740
So you should actually have your column Names at the top showing a distinct category.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,730
So each column showing a distinct category.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,720
So we have a column for customers,

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,020
another call for products region sales amount,

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,400
order,

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,980
mount order,

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,510
date.

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,400
And this is supposed to be the year.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,280
And this one is supposed to be the quarter.

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,940
However,

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,240
we do not have them labeled here because we want to demonstrate something.

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,710
OK,

21
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,820
so let's try to create a pivot table here.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm gonna click inside my data press control and a on my keyboard to select only data,

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,390
even including the columns that are not labeled.

24
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,260
And then I'm gonna click on the insert tab on the ribbon click on pivot table,

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,120
and then I'm gonna insert a pivot table and you worksheet click.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,500
OK,

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:03,910
here.

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,020
And as you could see her,

29
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,570
a pivot table has been created.

30
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,210
But our columns that are not labelled have not been included in the pivot table.

31
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,550
Feels so the columns that were not labeled where,

32
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,130
the quarter and the year.

33
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,450
So this is why we need to make sure to label our columns.

34
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,810
So if you go back to our data here and then create some labels for columns year and then

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,540
quarter and then create another pivot table insert to select all our data,

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,660
insert a pivot table and then click OK here.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,950
And you can see here that the columns have been created because they do have labels.

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,190
So the bottom line from this lesson is that you need to make sure to create labels for all

39
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,090
your columns,

40
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,870
and please note as well that in older Excel virgins,

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,740
instead of creating a pivot table without the unlabeled columns,

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,120
you might actually get an error while creating a pivot table for columns that are not label

43
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,120
.

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,330
So always make sure to create labels for your columns before creating a pivot table
