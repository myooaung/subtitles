1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
Now we're going to speak about creating formulas in calculated fields,

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,960
so we're able to use any Excel function in calculated fields as Unger's.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,350
We're not referring to a cell,

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:19,690
so we're not referring to sell a two or B one or any cell in Excel is our as long as we're

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,180
not referring to a cell,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,150
were able to use Excel formulas and functions in calculated fields.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,100
So let's create a calculated field based on an excel function the F function,

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,720
for example.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,770
So I'm going to select my pivot table here,

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,780
go to pivot table in I stab fields and fields,

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,700
items and sets and then click on calculated field.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,680
And then I'm gonna create a calculated field,

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,480
which is ah,

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,350
discount.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,870
Basically,

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,910
we're going to give a discount if the sales amount is greater than a certain threshold.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,780
Which anarchists gonna be 250,000 for example?

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:09,370
So if the sales amount is greater than 250,000 then we're gonna go give a 5% disco else.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,500
We're just gonna give a zero disco.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,740
So now,

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,700
as you can see here,

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,270
this formula does not reference any South,

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,200
so it should work now Let's press,

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,790
OK?

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,490
And as you can see,

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,620
her are calculated.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,560
Field has been created here and I'm just going to change here the format of that field.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,320
So I'm just going to select the whole field,

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,790
press control and one on my keyboard percentage and press OK here.

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:41,600
And as you can see here we have a 5% discount whenever our sales amount exceeds 250 $1000.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,450
Also,

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,670
as you can see here,

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,480
this formula is even being applied to the sub totals.

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,790
So the sub culture of the whole January,

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,420
for example,

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,660
and this is probably not what we want to do because we're applying this formula to the

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,270
sales for each reason here.

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,960
So we're going to give a discount if a reason,

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,650
for example,

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,510
buys products from us greater than 250,000.

41
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,960
But we don't want to give a discount on the sub total of January.

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,750
That is not what we want to do.

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,240
So were probably,

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,850
in this case,

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,520
need to turn off the sub totals in order for pivot table to reflect meaningful numbers.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,960
So to turn off our sub totals,

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,080
we need to select our pivot table good of the design tab on the ribbon and then go to

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,500
subtitles here and then Do not show sub totals.

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,990
And,

50
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,370
as you can see here now are Pivot Table is giving us a more meaningful result.

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,450
So that's eight guys on how to use formulas and functions and pivot table calculated fields

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:43,450
.

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,470
Basically,

54
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,560
in order to use an Excel function in a calculated field,

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,080
you need to make sure that you're not referring to individual cells.

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,450
So thank just watching this video and Nazi on the next one.
