00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.440
Okay,

2
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.020
so to speak,

3
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.500
about viewing and changing the data source for a pivot table.

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.210
So here I've got a pivot table in this worksheet this called pivot,

5
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.360
and in order to view and change the A source for it,

6
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.590
I can just select to sell inside the pivot table and then go to the anal.

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.910
I step on the ribbon and then click on change data source.

8
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.940
As you can see here,

9
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.310
the data source for the spirit table is just a range of cells here in the worksheet called

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.780
Data Range and basically this range of cells if we add more rose to it.

11
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.230
So when we add more rows store data,

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.130
the pivot table is not going to detect these rows,

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.650
so it's not gonna include them.

14
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.570
So that's Strider,

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.120
actually.

16
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.680
So if you go to the worksheet called Data Range,

17
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.930
and if you select themselves here and just duplicate them by pressing control in diesel,

18
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.280
so like some of the blank rows churl indeed to duplicate.

19
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.900
So I'm just adding more rose to my data,

20
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.880
and then I go back to my pivot table and then go to the analysed have on the ribbon click

21
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.100
on change data source.

22
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.000
As you can see here,

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.340
the data source has not included the new rose.

24
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.800
So what we need to do is to include in euros we can select all the rosier Aiken,

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.350
just press shift as I select more cells and then press control shift down on my keyboard to

26
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.780
select all the rows,

27
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.380
so that's one way of doing it.

28
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.930
But the better way is to put my data in a data table.

29
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.320
So here is another worksheet that contains a data table.

30
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.850
So,

31
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.200
actually,

32
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.800
if I switch my data source to the data table So if I make this data source might data table

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.550
here called TVL sales So this way,

34
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.180
whenever I add new rose,

35
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.550
they will actually be included.

36
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.760
If I add more rows to the table,

37
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.090
they will always be included.

38
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.420
So let's just copy Cem rose here and just paste them.

39
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.930
And let's check again the data source.

40
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.070
As you can see here,

41
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.970
the extra data has been included automatically.

42
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.660
This is why it's always a good practice to base your pivot tables on Excel data tables and

43
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.630
not just ranges because whenever you add extra data to your data tables,

44
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.500
the table are gonna include the extra data automatically and the pivot table are gonna

45
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.550
include them as well.

46
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.110
Where is when you have just a range of cells?

47
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.500
They will not be included automatically.

48
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.630
So that's a tip for you.

49
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.670
Because when you work with spreadsheets that other people have created,

50
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.790
they might not know this tip and they would create their pivot tables based on just data

51
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.220
ranges.

52
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.550
Normal data range is not the tables.

53
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.370
So you got to be aware of that,

54
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.480
S o always create data tables out of your data ranges,

55
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.150
and you can always,

56
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.600
of course,

57
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.690
convert you arrange to a data table by selecting any cell inside your range and then insert

58
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.550
table and you're able to create adidas table out of that and then make your pivot table get

59
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.240
its data from the data table.

60
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.690
So thanks for watching.

61
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.760
We'll see on the next one
