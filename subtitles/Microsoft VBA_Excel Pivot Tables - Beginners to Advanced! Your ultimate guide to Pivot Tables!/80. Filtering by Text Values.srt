1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
in this video,

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,530
we're going to discuss label filters or text filters.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,890
So here we've got a pivot table of get the salesperson on the road section and the sum of

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,150
sales amount on the submission of value section.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,650
And we can apply some label filters or text filters here,

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,790
and the label filters air basically gonna be applied to the rule labels.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,010
So the sales person field here.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,540
So if you go here level filters,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,180
we can see your first filters equals and equals means that you've got to put the exact

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,510
value they need to filter for,

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,520
so I can filter,

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,990
for example,

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,480
for our first sales person here are doing Burton,

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,040
and the filter is actually not case sensitive.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,790
And so,

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,770
if I type it here as lower case letters press OK,

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,570
you can see here we're able to filter a press control and see here to a moment filter.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,450
There's also under the filter here,

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,950
which is does not equal to so filter for everything except add GN Burton sofa press.

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,260
Okay,

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,350
Here it will filter off Adrian Burton and it will keep that the other sales persons all

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,370
press control Z here to remove my filter.

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,210
And then our next filter here is begins with So begins with is a filter where you could

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,460
filter with a value that begins with this value they're gonna put so I can filter for all

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,870
people beginning with an A,

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,500
for example.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,750
So here it will give me Adrianne and Alison and so on and so forth.

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,750
So this filters here with a value that begins with the value that you put into the filter.

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,230
And also there is does not begin with.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,790
So people not beginning within a so anyone whose name does not begin within a press.

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,120
Okay,

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,500
here.

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,710
So,

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,810
as you consider we filtered off the people who begin within a and the other people are the

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,140
ones here who appear on our filter press control Z here.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,470
And then the next filter here is ends with so ends with a certain value so I can end with t

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:54,620
o.

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,540
And for example,

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:03,830
and this will give me Burton and Newton's because these people's names and with a t o n a

40
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,570
press concerns e here and then our next filter here is does not end with so does not end

41
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,650
with is basically the reverse off ended with costo and all people know ending with a t o n

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:16,650
.

43
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,800
Chris controls here to remove the filter and then we've got contains.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,000
So the contains filter is basically a filter for values that contain the value that I'm

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,130
gonna enter here.

46
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,630
So,

47
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,380
for example,

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,620
people who have a y e n in their name press okay,

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,640
here it's only Bobby going.

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,110
He's the only one who has a Y E and in his name and then does not contain is people who do

51
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,050
not contain,

52
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,690
for example,

53
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,870
this value so do not contain T.

54
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,300
O n.

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,230
So anyone who doesn't continue to you and so all these people press control NZ here.

56
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,230
So basically,

57
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,290
this is how you can filter text values on pivot tables.

58
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,700
Now there are also more options here which are basically greater than or equal to unless

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,450
then in between or not between.

60
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,170
So these options were going to use when we have values the r e mix of numerical on text

61
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,540
values,

62
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,520
and we'll see that on the next video
