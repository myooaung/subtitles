00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
Another calculation that we can perform on pivot tables is the percentage of column tool.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.480
So we're able to calculate the percentage of each value from its column total.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.810
And to do that,

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.220
we're gonna insert our fuel that we need to apply the calculation.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.650
Stewart,

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.550
In our case here,

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.680
it's the sales amount,

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.160
and then we're going to click on it,

9
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.810
go to value fuel settings and then go to show values as and then here,

10
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.280
we're going to select percentage of column total,

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.820
and then I'm gonna rename it to percentage of column tool as well.

12
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.530
And then I'm gonna press okay,

13
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.780
here and now we have a calculation that calculates the percentage of each value from its

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.580
column total.

15
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.930
So,

16
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.570
for example,

17
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.860
here 17.47 percent is the percentage of 737,378 from this total here,

18
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.120
which is four million,

19
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.000
221,579.

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
And if we sum up the percentages of our sub totals,

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.450
so we sum up 17.47 percent plus 21.9 plus 61.45 here if we sum them up.

22
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.550
We get a submission of 100% and basically their 100% is this value here,

23
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.450
which is the total for the whole column.

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.380
And if we sum up all these individual values here and exclude the sub totals,

25
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.590
we're going to get 100% as well.

26
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.350
And this is because each of these values,

27
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.660
the percentage beside it,

28
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.610
is the percentage from the column total basically.

29
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.220
Okay,

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.540
so this is how you can perform a percentage of column total calculation in pivot tables.
