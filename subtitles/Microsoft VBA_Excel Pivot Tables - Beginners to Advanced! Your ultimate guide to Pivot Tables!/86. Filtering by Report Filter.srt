00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
in this video,

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,080
we're going to discuss faltering boy Report filters in pivot tables so you can actually

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,260
filter your pivot table using the report Filter's area here.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,600
So you simply drag a certain field toe.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,460
The report filter,

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,450
and that means that you can filter by that particular field.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,960
So when you drag a field to the airport filter.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,290
So,

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,720
for example,

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,990
if I dragged the product name here,

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,350
you can see her that it's appeared at the filter's area at the top here.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,420
So when you drag a field to this area,

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,080
it appears at the top of the pivot table and using that you can actually filter your pivot

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,390
table.

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:34,810
So here,

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,750
if I click on this arrow here beside product,

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,490
you can see I can filter by product one click.

18
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,050
OK,

19
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,360
so that means that the information or the results here shown on the pivot table are for

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,730
only product one.

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,020
And this way I can filter for only product one.

22
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,870
I can also select multiple items.

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,620
If I check this check box and select part one and product to,

24
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,370
for example,

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,650
I can select all the products using this old check box,

26
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,410
I can uncheck all on that select product one and product to Onley impress.

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:07,910
Okay,

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:14,160
this means now that the results here are for product one I'm product to and you can build

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,540
upon these filters.

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,720
You can select one or more customers,

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,410
for example,

32
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,370
because elect one customer here only Millennium Inc and press.

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:23,800
OK,

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,870
so that means that the results here showed on a pivot table offer products on a product to

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,520
and for millennium.

36
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,860
So now you've excluded Oh,

37
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,410
the other customers.

38
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,500
And if excluded,

39
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,730
product three.

40
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,460
You can also filter using this search part,

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,470
but you need to make sure to select multiple items before you use the filter.

42
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,070
And here this is a sales month.

43
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,380
So it contains my months stacks.

44
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,950
So,

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,610
for example,

46
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,250
filter for months ending U A r y So in this case is gonna be January and February.

47
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,020
So here I've got a check box.

48
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,420
Select old search results.

49
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,730
Yes,

50
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,460
I need these two months to be selected.

51
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,300
Press okay,

52
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,860
and I will see the results for only January and February.

53
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,370
But in my case here,

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,050
there is no data for January and February for Millennium Inc.

55
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,140
But maybe if I select another company here.

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,540
So at to life,

57
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,950
I don't have results.

58
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,850
Visionary,

59
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,020
I do have results for January and February.

60
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,830
I could also add more items to my filters here.

61
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,070
So for example,

62
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,540
I currently have January and February selected.

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,540
I can add the months the end in e.

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,840
R,

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,530
for example.

66
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,770
So select e r.

67
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,120
And then you can see her.

68
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,320
I will have September,

69
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,770
October,

70
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,310
November,

71
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,850
December in the search results.

72
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,170
I can actually add the current selection to filter and select all search results.

73
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,160
So I want to select all these search results and I want to add them to the current

74
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,260
selection as well.

75
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,500
So press OK.

76
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,100
And now if we check off filters here,

77
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,620
you can see her.

78
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,930
I've got January and February,

79
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,280
and I've got these months here that ended in e r.

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,990
Number October,

81
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,050
November December.

82
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,270
Add it to my filters.

83
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,630
So these results here are for September,

84
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:09,990
October,

85
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,380
November and December and Virginia in February.

86
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,050
And for product one and two.

87
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,040
And for all the customers,

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,850
older regions,

89
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,210
all the service persons,

90
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,750
of course,

91
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,830
that I can apply filters for any other field that I would have here in the filter's area.

92
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,830
So the filter's area and in older Excel versions as well you'd see called Report Filter

93
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,140
contains the fields that I need to filter mike pivot table with.

94
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,450
OK,

95
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,010
so that's it,

96
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,470
guys for the report filters.

97
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,680
Thank you so much watching,

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,760
I'll see on the next.
