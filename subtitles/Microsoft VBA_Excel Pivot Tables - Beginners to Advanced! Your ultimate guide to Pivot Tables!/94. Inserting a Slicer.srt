1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
and this video,

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,410
we're going to speak about a feature in pivot tables that's going to allow us to filter our

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,360
data in a more interactive and user friendly wait.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,800
This feature is called slicers,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,150
so slicers are basically more user friendly filters.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,770
I'm filtering your pivot table.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,290
Using slicers is more user friendly than clicking on a field header and then starting to

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:29,400
apply your filters this way And slicers are a relatively new feature in Excel.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,610
They've been introduced since Excel 2000 ton.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,390
And to insert a slicer,

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,450
all you need to do is to select a cell inside your pivot table and then go to the insert

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,830
tab on the ribbon and then click on slicer.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,830
As you can see here,

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,480
you will get a list of the fields the are available in your pivot table,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,620
and this list will be identical to the Pivot Table fields list.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,730
Here and now I can start selecting feels to use on my slicers,

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,530
so I'm going to select the customer,

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,500
the product name,

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,490
reason and the year and the sales person as well,

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,230
and I'm gonna click OK here.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,200
And as you can see here,

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,200
I managed to insert five slicers for these five feels and slicers actually allow me to

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,650
filter my pivot table with fields that are not present on my pivot table.

24
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,140
So,

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,830
for example,

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm able to filter this pivot table here with the reason so I can click on the Americas to

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,400
filter my pivot table with the Americas.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Although the reason field is not available anywhere on my pivot table,

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,640
it's not inserted here on my pivot table and to remove filters or to clear the filters.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,110
Here.

31
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,950
You can click on this button here to clear the filters applied on any slicer.

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,470
And now I'm gonna filter,

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,150
for example,

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,030
with product.

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,590
One says he can see her after filming with product one.

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,450
I have some sales people who don't have data in some years.

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,590
So,

38
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,140
for example,

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,740
Billy here doesn't have any sales data in 2019.

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,560
That is because Billy has not sold any product one in 2019.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,440
I can also apply filters for multiple items so I can apply a filter for product one end

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,820
product to at the same time.

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,600
So currently I have product one filter applied.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,750
I can press and hold the control by Norma Keyboard and then click on product to.

45
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,090
And now I've applied my filter using product one and product to.

46
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,490
So now my pivot table is filtered for product.

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,520
One end product to I could also apply filters for multiple consecutive items on a certain

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,000
field.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,410
So,

50
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:38,920
for example,

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,040
here on the sales person slicer or field,

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,860
I can click on one sales person,

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,100
and I can apply a filter for all the sales people from Adrianne until Madeline,

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,690
for example.

55
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,070
So I'm gonna press and hold my shift button and then click on Madeleine.

56
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,230
As you can see here,

57
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:01,250
I've applied my filters for all the salespeople between Adrian and Madeline.

58
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,540
Now I'm gonna select to apply a filter for the Americas only here on my pivot table.

59
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,810
As you can see here,

60
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,630
you can see that some items on some slicers.

61
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,770
So,

62
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,380
for example,

63
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,050
on the customer slicer here,

64
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,090
some items were two companies,

65
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,950
millennium and visionary are dimmed on this slicer currently after selecting the Americas.

66
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,050
And that means that we don't have any data on our data set for Millennium and visionary

67
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,360
after applying these filters here so often are playing the Americas.

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,120
We have only the sales people that sold in the Americas.

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,350
And we have these two products as well that we had filtered initially and to verify that on

70
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,070
our data.

71
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,660
I'm gonna actually insert another window here.

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,410
So I'm gonna go to the view tab and then go to a new window and is because here I have

73
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,630
another window open off the same workbook on I can go to the data worksheet and it can

74
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,440
start applying these filters.

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,440
So I'm gonna first of all filter with these sales people here Adrianne,

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,450
Alison,

77
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,520
Billy,

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,570
Ivan and Jamie and Katrina and click OK,

79
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:11,940
here.

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,470
I'm gonna filter with the Americas Onley because this is the region that we had the filters

81
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,210
applied for,

82
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,560
and I'm gonna filter with product one and product to because these are the products that we

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,480
had filtered with.

84
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,810
And as you can see here,

85
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,650
we have only one customer to life.

86
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,820
The other two customers are not appearing on our data after applying these filters,

87
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,850
and this is why they are dimmed on the customer slicer.

88
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay,

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,580
so any deem dimmed fields are basically feels that don't have any data after you applied

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,890
filters using these slicers.

91
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,450
Okay,

92
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,570
so that's it,

93
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,860
guys,

94
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,940
for the basic usage off slicers in the upcoming videos,

95
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,950
we're going to speak more about slicers and customizing them.

96
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,540
Thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
