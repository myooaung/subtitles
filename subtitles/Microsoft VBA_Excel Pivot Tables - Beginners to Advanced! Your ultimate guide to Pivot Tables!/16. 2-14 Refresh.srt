00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180
Hey,

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,460
guys,

3
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,010
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,900
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,670
we're going to speak about refreshing your pivot table.

6
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:12,230
So we've spoken before about the pivot table cash and that it's a snapshot of your data

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,110
that is underlying the pivot table.

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,240
So actually,

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,040
when you change any of your data or if your data changes,

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,590
basically you have to refresh your pivot table.

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,550
So we're going to see how we can do that in this video.

12
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,230
And also,

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,800
I want to demonstrate something else.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,750
So I'm gonna copy my pivot table.

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,140
I'm gonna hide like my whole pivot table here.

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm gonna copy but pressing control and see on my keyboard and then paste it just below

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:38,690
here,

18
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,290
creating just a copy of my pivot table by pressing control and V on my keyboard.

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,750
Now I'm gonna go make a change on my data.

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,060
So let's say on any off the rose for product one.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,990
I'm just gonna change the sales amount,

22
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,200
make it one million,

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,880
for example,

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,820
on 23456 and then actually,

25
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,510
for the new numbers to reflect on the pivot table,

26
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,250
I need to refresh it.

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,350
So to refresh my pivot table,

28
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,390
I can either select my paper table and then go to the data tab on the ribbon.

29
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,370
Click on this arrow here on the refresh old and then click on Refresh and you will notice.

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,730
Actually,

31
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,300
although I'm refreshing just one pivot table,

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,580
both pivot tables will be refreshed,

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,540
and the numbers on product one will update on both pivot tables.

34
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,830
So it's just refresh it here,

35
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,450
and you can see here in the number here for product one has updated for in 2016 because the

36
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,500
change that we've done here waas in product 14 2016.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,290
This is why the numbers have updated for 2016 Mexicans here.

38
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,260
The refresh has been done for both pivot tables.

39
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,360
So why is that the case?

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,200
It's because both pivot tables are linked or tied to the same pivot cash.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,080
So the data source is the same,

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,890
which is the same pivot cash,

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,170
which is our data.

44
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,550
You can also refresh your pivot table by right clicking and then clicking on refresh so

45
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,220
right clicking on the pivot table and then clicking on refresh.

46
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,820
And this will also refresh your pivot table.

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,550
OK,

48
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,700
so basically,

49
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,600
whenever your data gets updated you will need to refresh your pivot table because your

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,390
pivot cash is just a snapshot from your pivot table.

51
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,230
And so when the data gets updated,

52
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,870
we need to update that snack shop by refreshing our pivot table.

53
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,330
OK,

54
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:27,800
so thanks,

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,550
guys watching I'll see on the next one.
