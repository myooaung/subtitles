00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
and this video,

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,000
we're going to see how to group our dates by weeks.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,170
Starting on a certain day Says you can see here.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,410
I've got the order date here on the road section and the submission of sales amount on the

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,820
submission of Value Section.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,170
Unless,

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,470
say,

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,590
when a group my dates by weeks,

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,190
that start on a Monday.

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:25,660
So I'd want to group here my dates into seven days that start on a Monday.

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,730
So to do that,

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,650
I'm going to right click here on the dates and then click on group.

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,960
And as it is here,

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,940
the first date here on my data is actually the 10th of January if I check the 10th of

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,720
January 2016.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,600
So if I go to my calendar here and check 10th of January 2016 as you can see here,

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,550
10th a junior 2016 is a Sunday.

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,520
But this,

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,040
according to my grouping,

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,500
or according to the grouping that I want to apply,

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,300
would belong to the week starting on Monday,

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,400
the Fourth of January.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,910
So it actually want to change my grouping here to start on the fourth at January 2016.

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,590
Because That is the week starting on a Monday that the first date on my data belongs to,

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,230
and I want to select here to group by days,

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,060
and the number of days is going to be seven.

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,790
Of course,

28
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,190
if you want your weeks to start on a different day other than a Monday,

29
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,790
then you could choose the Tuesday or Wednesday.

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,860
So if you want our weeks to start on Tuesday,

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,020
then would choose the fifth of January in this case.

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,190
And if you want them to start on Wednesdays,

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,140
then would choose the sixth of January and so on and so forth.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,350
So after selecting days here and number of days seven days,

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,870
I'll click.

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,560
OK,

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
and as you can see here,

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,650
I managed to group my dates into weeks starting on Monday's.

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,290
So That's it,

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,790
guys for grouping by dates starting on a certain day.

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,350
Thank you so much Watching this video also on the next one
