00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140
Hey,

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,400
guys,

3
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,950
welcome back.

4
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,140
So as you can see here,

5
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,670
we've got a pivot table,

6
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,650
and this pivot table has the park team and the sales person on the road section and the

7
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,880
year on the columns section and the summation of sales year on the Submission of Value

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,360
Section.

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,890
And as you can see here,

10
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,920
this pivot table,

11
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,590
if we select a cell inside it,

12
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,430
go to design Tab and then on the report layout.

13
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,690
We're currently actually in the compact.

14
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,520
For now.

15
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,430
If we switch to the outline form,

16
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,380
you will see here that the sales person has been indented to the right,

17
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,860
and it is in its own column at the moment.

18
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,640
Now we can actually achieve something similar to that.

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,230
But actually,

20
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,320
in the compact form,

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,920
we've explained the different pivot table layouts reportedly outs previously on a previous

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,390
video.

23
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,860
So please refer back to that video.

24
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,220
Now,

25
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,560
if we switch back to the compact form,

26
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,660
there's an option that we can use,

27
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,850
which we can get to by right clicking and then clicking on pivot table options.

28
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,340
And then there is an option here,

29
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,180
it says,

30
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,780
when in compact form in dentro labels by one character.

31
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:00,950
It's,

32
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,050
Carney said at one.

33
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,800
But weaken.

34
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,910
Change that to 10 for example,

35
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,890
10 characters.

36
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,280
And then we press okay.

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,190
And as you can see here,

38
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,090
it's been indented easy,

39
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,090
cause here the sales person has been indented by 10 characters.

40
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,510
It looks now more like an outline form,

41
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,600
but actually we're currently in the compact for so it's a way to achieve a look that is

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,420
similar to the outline form,

43
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,530
but actually in the compact form.
