00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
and this video,

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.830
we're going to see how to group by fiscal years and fiscal quarters in pivot tables,

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.690
so there is no built in way in pivot tables in order to group by fiscal years or fiscal

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.310
quarters.

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:21.010
So you have to write formulas on your data in order to create a fiscal your column and a

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.080
fiscal quarter call.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.600
So I created the columns here on my data,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.110
and I just need to write the formulas to calculate the fiscal years on fiscal quarters for

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.030
the order date.

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.330
So,

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.770
first of all,

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.580
for the fiscal year,

13
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.300
I'm going to assume that the fiscal year starts in April,

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.180
since it starts in April,

15
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.690
where live here in Canada but you could always tweak The format is to match your businesses

16
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.190
fiscal year start date,

17
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.590
so to calculate the fiscal year,

18
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.100
basically because it starts in eight pro the 1st 3 months on the calendar year belonged to

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.090
the previous fiscal year.

20
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.140
So January,

21
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.440
February and March,

22
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.000
on the calendar year on a certain counter year,

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.780
belonged to the fiscal year for the previous year or belonged to the previous year's fiscal

24
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.310
year.

25
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.070
So here,

26
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.880
for example,

27
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.680
for the order date ninth of October 2016.

28
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.970
This still belongs to the fiscal year of 2016 because the fiscal year of 2016 starts in

29
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.490
April and toe any dates between the first of April 2016 and the 31st of December 2016

30
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.400
belonged to the fiscal year of 2016.

31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.890
And the dates between the 1st 2 January 2016 up until the end of March,

32
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.220
2016 belonged to the fiscal year for 2015.

33
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.960
So we can actually write a simple formula here that the fiscal year is equal to the year of

34
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.920
this state minus.

35
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.840
And we're gonna actually right,

36
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.450
a true or false condition that's gonna transform into a one or zero,

37
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.750
which is that we're gonna test if the month of the state is less than four.

38
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.860
So if the month of the date is less than four than this partier off,

39
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.290
the formula is gonna become true.

40
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.370
And if it is greater than four than it's gonna become a false,

41
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.780
which is the case here,

42
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.150
and this door falls will be transformed into a one or a zero because we have a minus sign

43
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.580
here.

44
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.470
So that means that in case the condition is true and in case this month is less than four,

45
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.670
we will be subtracting one from our year,

46
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.650
so the date will be belonging to the previous fiscal year.

47
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.670
But in this case,

48
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.800
in this particular order dates case,

49
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.980
which is ninth of October 2016 here the condition will be a fall.

50
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.560
So also will be subtracting zero and so it will be in the same fiscal year,

51
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.720
So this order date will be in the fiscal year off.

52
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.160
2063

53
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.560
Press enter Now let's drag the formula down and let's check a date that is on the 1st 3

54
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.910
months,

55
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.580
for example,

56
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.260
this 1/9 of March 2016.

57
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.880
This belongs to the fiscal year off 2050.

58
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.930
Because here the condition that we put to the test if the month is less than four and

59
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.900
actually the month is less than four,

60
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.120
right,

61
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.110
because it's a three,

62
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.060
then this condition will become a true and then because of the negative sign,

63
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.410
you will be subtracting the one.

64
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.220
So if we highlight the whole thing here,

65
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.350
impress F nine here because here it subtracts the one from 2016 so it becomes a 2015.

66
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.520
So this is how you can calculate the fiscal year.

67
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.230
Now let's see how to calculate the fiscal quarter.

68
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.790
So to calculate the fiscal quarter,

69
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.760
there is a very easy way to do it,

70
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.170
which is using the choose function so equals Jews and the Jews function.

71
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.380
You simply give it an index number,

72
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.940
the index number would be an integer,

73
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.530
and you give it a number of choices.

74
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.370
And based on the inter jury that you're going to give it,

75
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.370
it's gonna make a choice out of these choices.

76
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.140
So the integer we're going to give it is actually the month of our date.

77
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.150
So that's going to be an integer between one and 12 because they're only 12 months in a

78
00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.540
year,

79
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.090
and then the values were going to give it to choose from.

80
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.030
We agreed before that the 1st 3 months belong to the fourth quarter off the previous year,

81
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.320
right?

82
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.770
The 1st 3 months on a calendar year belong to the fourth quarter off the previous fiscal

83
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.270
year,

84
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:27.730
so the 1st 3 months on 2016 will be on the lost quarter or the fourth quarter off 2000 and

85
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.350
15

86
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.820
So this is why you were going to give it the truces of 444 and then 111 Right.

87
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.110
This is when the 1st 3 months of the new fiscal year,

88
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.460
which is 2016 start right and then to to to these air the following three months,

89
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.870
which correspond to the second quarter off the fiscal year 2000 and 16 on then 333 which

90
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.210
are the third quarter off the fiscal year off 2060.

91
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.860
So this part of the choose function here would yield a number between one and 12.

92
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.610
So for highlight this month,

93
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.250
part here,

94
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.020
and you press f nine because here it gives us the number 10.

95
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.050
So that means it will choose the 10th choice out of these choices.

96
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:23.670
So get six year 789 10 so october would belong to the third quarter off the fiscal year off

97
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.920
2060

98
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.430
So if a press enter here and we dragged the formula down,

99
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.570
were able to get the fiscal court there also other ways to get the fiscal quarter,

100
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.250
and I actually have a video on my YouTube channel that explains different ways to get the

101
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.120
fiscal year and fiscal quarter and quarter and all these date calculations,

102
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.410
and I'm gonna leave you the link for that video in the resource is section and I would

103
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.600
highly recommend that you would watch it.

104
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.570
Now let's refresh our pivot table here,

105
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.200
Sophie,

106
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.120
Right Click on our pivot table on refresh it and then you can see here we're able to group

107
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.170
with fiscal quarters,

108
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.980
for example,

109
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.320
and with fiscal years,

110
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.050
if you would like so we could remove the fiscal quarters.

111
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.120
And now we're able to group by fiscal year.

112
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.620
So there is no built in way in pivot tables to group by fiscal quarters or fiscal years.

113
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.860
But we're able to do that through a for minutes.

114
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.110
Okay,

115
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.060
so let's see it guys on how to group by fiscal quarters and fiscal years.

116
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.150
Thank you so much watching this video I'll see on the next
