00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
in this video,

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.400
we're going to show a tip for cleaning your data.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.160
And this is a common problem.

4
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.450
Actually,

5
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
that might happen to you when you use data for creating pivot tables.

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.340
So here we've got some data here.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.890
We've got a column containing some countries and let's create a pivot table out of it.

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.920
So I'm just going to select the whole column by pressing control and am a keyboard and then

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.350
insert a pivot table.

10
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.870
And actually,

11
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.540
instead of putting it in the new worksheet,

12
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.450
I want to put it actually just beside our data so that we can see what the problem is.

13
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.320
So we get a pivot table here created I'm gonna put the country in the rose section of the

14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.930
pivot table,

15
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.360
and normally when you create a pivot table,

16
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.570
it should only show unique values.

17
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.650
But as you can see here,

18
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.780
we've got some duplicates of the countries who got is traded twice.

19
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.870
Friends twice,

20
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.270
Germany,

21
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.800
twice.

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.030
So what's the reason for that?

23
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.690
So the reason for that is that we've got leading oh,

24
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.470
training spaces in our values.

25
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.250
So actually,

26
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.680
if you double click on a value of press F two on your keyboard,

27
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.140
you're able to inspect the values to hear the value,

28
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.330
doesn't have any leading or training spaces.

29
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.180
But if we check the other Germany because we've got Germany twice here on the pivot table,

30
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.110
you can see here that it's got an extra space here at the end.

31
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.630
So this is what we've got to Germany values because the pivot table were recognized,

32
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.310
these values as two different values because one of them has a space,

33
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.480
a trading space at the end and the other one does not,

34
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.860
and the same cases for Francis Well,

35
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.330
so as you can see here for friends,

36
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.870
this one does not have any leading or training space.

37
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.380
But if we check the other friends,

38
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.320
he comes here.

39
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.290
The other friends does have a leading space,

40
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.710
actually,

41
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.770
So this is a common problem that you might face when creating pivot tables that you'd have

42
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.070
leading or trading spaces.

43
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.860
And that means spaces at the beginning or the end of your values that would make your

44
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.970
values seem different to the pivot table.

45
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.510
Though you know you're intending for this to be Germany and the other one to be Germany.

46
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.830
These should be the same value.

47
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.970
This is what you want.

48
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.020
So how do we get over this problem we can use actually a function in excel to clean our

49
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.350
data,

50
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.830
which is the trim function so equals trim and the term function removes any leading or

51
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.050
training spaces in our values.

52
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.610
So that means any spaces before a ward or any spaces after a ward extra spaces after award

53
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.610
.

54
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.600
And this is what we need So we can use the trim function and we can just apply it to all

55
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.530
our values here.

56
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.950
And then we can actually copy and pieced our values years to right click and we're gonna

57
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.510
paste values because we're gonna pace the values,

58
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.750
not the formula.

59
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.530
And then we're gonna delete our function here,

60
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.200
and then we can actually refresh our pivot table,

61
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.390
right?

62
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.710
Click on our pivot table and then refresh.

63
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.830
As you can see here,

64
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.660
we Onley now have unique values.

65
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.390
We don't have any duplicates in our pivoting on.

66
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.990
This is a common problem that you would face when using pivot tables
