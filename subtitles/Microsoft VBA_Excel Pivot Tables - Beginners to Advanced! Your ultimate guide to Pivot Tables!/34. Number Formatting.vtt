If you need to change the number formatting on your values field,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.400
you're able to do that using multiple ways.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.380
So one way is to go to your values field here,

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.410
which is the submission of sales in this case under Submission of Values section here.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.860
So you click on this arrow and then there is value field settings and then you click on

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.260
number format and you're able to change the formatting of your number here.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.730
So this is the sales amount.

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.110
It should be in dollars.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.960
So I'll press on currency here and I'll choose United States dollars for examples of

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.290
English.

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.790
United States are most of the distant places are click OK,

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.860
click OK again.

13
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.910
As you can see here,

14
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.790
the values field formatting has changed.

15
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.630
Alternatively,

16
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.010
you can right click here on any cell on the values field,

17
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.330
and then there is value field settings here,

18
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.400
and this leads you to the same option.

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.100
So this is how you can change the number format for you values field.

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.000
Another way to do it is to press control and one on your keyboard,

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.350
and you will get also to the same dialog box here pushes for number formatting.

22
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.340
And also,

23
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.260
