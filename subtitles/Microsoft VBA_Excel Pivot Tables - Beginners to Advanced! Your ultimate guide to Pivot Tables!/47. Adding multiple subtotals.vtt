00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
when it comes to settles in pivot tables,

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.190
the default aggregation applied for settles is a summation.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.470
So,

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.140
for example,

5
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.790
here the subtitle here on product one is basically the summation here for all the sales

6
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.760
done for sales persons that sold product one so you can see her.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.650
1,095,430 is the summation poor?

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.130
The sales for all the salespersons that sold product one,

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.760
however,

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.750
were able to apply more aggregations on the sub totals.

11
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.110
So we're able to have account or an average,

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.920
and were able to add multiple subtitles as well at the same time.

13
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.580
So let me show you how we can do that.

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.800
So we're going to go to the field that has the subtitle that we need to change here on the

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.370
field list.

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.650
So we're gonna go to the product name because this is the subtitle that we need to change,

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.010
click on it and then go to the field settings.

18
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.150
And then here we've got some options.

19
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.640
Under sub totals of filters,

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.680
you got automatic.

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.970
Automatic is basically the summation.

22
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.410
Some is the automatic subtitle is applied and we've got none which would remove the sub

23
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.140
total and with custom and custom opens more options for us.

24
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.230
Here on a zika sear,

25
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.990
we can add some count average max men product all these guns of subtitles and were able to

26
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.610
add them at the same time as well.

27
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.930
So we can click on one and then press and hold the control button on our keyboard and then

28
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.660
click more.

29
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.270
Subtitles that we need to add I'm gonna add some count,

30
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.640
average max and men all of the same time.

31
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.220
And if we press okay,

32
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.570
here,

33
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.550
you can see area that we've got different sub totals.

34
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.120
Add it to our subtitles.

35
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.770
So this is a great way if you need to include multiple settles at the same time multiple

36
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280
different sub totals at the same time quickly.
