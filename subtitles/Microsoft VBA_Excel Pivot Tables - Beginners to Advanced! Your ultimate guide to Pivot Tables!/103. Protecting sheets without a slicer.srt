00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
in this video,

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,450
we're going to see how we can protect our worksheets without protecting our slices so we

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,550
can actually protect our worksheets in order to make other users not able to edit them or

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,470
make changes to them unless they have the password.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,070
But we can actually exclude our slices from being protected so that the users can actually

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:30,150
select items from the slicer and view results on the pivot tables,

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,980
but without being able to edit other items on the worksheet.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,470
So,

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:42,000
first of all we need to exclude are slicers from being blocked as a result of protecting

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,780
our worksheet.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,180
So to do that,

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,360
we can actually select one slicer and the press control and a to select all the other

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,700
slicers on the sheet.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:58,300
Or you can select one slicer and then president hold the control button to select other

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,350
slices as well,

16
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,850
and then you can right click and then click on size and properties.

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:11,270
And then when you click on size and properties here under the properties option or top here

18
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,270
,

19
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,440
you're going to see this locked check box.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,680
You need to make sure to uncheck this lock check box.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
Now we've excluded are slicers from being blocked.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,470
Now we can go ahead,

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,110
unlock our worksheets,

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,160
so to lock or protect our worksheets,

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,970
we go to the review top here on the ribbon and then click on Protect,

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,490
Cheat.

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,910
And we have some options here.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,280
So there is the select locked cells.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,710
This option will enable us to select cells here on the worksheet after it's been locked.

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,690
So if you need the users to be able to select cells,

31
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,020
you can keep this checked.

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,420
But if you uncheck it,

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,210
users will not be able to even select cells.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,110
But they won't be ableto edit the cells anyways to be able to select them in case that this

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,070
is checked,

36
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,980
but they won't be able to edit them.

37
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,370
And here you're gonna have select unlocked cells.

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,290
You got to keep this check because this is going to enable you to select your slicers and

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,920
then at the bottom.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,750
Here there is the use pivot tables and pivot charts.

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,210
You need to make sure that this is checked as well,

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:26,000
so that you be able to use the pivot tables and pivot charts on your locked or protected

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,420
cheat.

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,960
And then,

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,690
if you need to have a passer toward the sheet.

46
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,660
You can write it here.

47
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,950
If you leave this empty,

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,350
the sheet will be locked without a password if you click.

49
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,850
OK,

50
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,250
here.

51
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,780
Now your sheet is locked and as you can see,

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,400
her were not able to select cells because they are locked here.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,860
And then you can select items from your slicer without any problems,

54
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,750
as you can see here.

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:56,850
And this is how you can look a worksheet without locking your slicers.

56
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,500
You can also go ahead or toe unlock or unprotected sheet here by clicking here on on

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,300
protect sheet.

58
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,360
If there had been a password for the sheep than Excel would have justice for the password

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,050
as well after pressing the UN protect sheet button.

60
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,790
Okay,

61
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,530
so this is how you can protect our luck,

62
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,160
your worksheets without locking your slicers.
