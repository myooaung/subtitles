00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
Let's say that we add a new region here toward data.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.890
So we've got currently Americas,

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.200
Australia and Europe.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.130
And let's say on our data we add a new row with Africa,

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.840
for example.

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.430
So I'm gonna expand here,

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.140
my table.

8
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:22.110
I'm gonna click here and drag on the small rectangle on the bottom right corner and then

9
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.860
I'm gonna release and then I'm gonna select the whole row,

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.620
impressed control and D on my keyboard here in order to copy or duplicate the role just

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.250
above it.

12
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.640
And here I'm just going to change the region to be Africa instead of Europe and press enter

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.260
and let's go back to a pivot table.

14
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.130
Now let's update a pivot table,

15
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.460
right,

16
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.700
click and refresh.

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.700
As you can see her,

18
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.900
we've got Africa.

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.460
However,

20
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.410
Africa is not obeying the normal sorting of the regions,

21
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.050
which is alphabetically from eight dizzy or in an ascending order.

22
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.960
So to do that,

23
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.460
I'm just going to right click here,

24
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.570
sort and sort eight easy to put Africa in the normal ascending alphabetical order.

25
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.450
So this is how you can make a newly added item part of the normal sorting on a pivot table
