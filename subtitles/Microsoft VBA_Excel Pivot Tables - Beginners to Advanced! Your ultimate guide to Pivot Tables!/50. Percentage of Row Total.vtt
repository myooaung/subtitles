00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
in this video,

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.340
we're going to see how we can perform a percentage of Roe total calculation in pivot tables

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.340
.

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.340
So a percentage of wrote a little calculation would give us the percentage of each value

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.750
from its row total.

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.570
So let's see that with an example here.

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.600
So I'm gonna insert again the sales amount.

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.950
I'm gonna put the sales amount fueled on the submission of value section.

9
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.670
So I'm gonna create another instance of that fueled here and then I'm going to click on it

10
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.670
,

11
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.110
go to value field settings and then go to show values as.

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.220
And then I'm gonna select here percentage of Roe total and I'm gonna change its title here

13
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.280
2% of Roe total and I'm gonna press OK,

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.650
and now we have a percentage of wrote a little calculation here.

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.910
So as you can see here,

16
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.830
we have the percentage of the row total beside each item here or beside the value of each

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.160
item.

18
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.380
So,

19
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.060
for example,

20
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.330
here on this sub total is 737,378.

21
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.340
It's 58.22% off the road total,

22
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.120
which the row total here is one million,

23
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.620
266,446.

24
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:20.130
And basically this value is 77% of its roto wrote and its Roe total here is ah 110,699.

25
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.080
So 85,235 77% of the 110 1006 199.

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.690
So this calculation here will get us the percentage of each value from its row total.

27
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.160
And this is the road total here,

28
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.330
which is under the submission off the sales amount that so the value on each row here

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.340
represents the total for each row.

30
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.810
And if you check this value,

31
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.350
for example,

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.310
this susceptible here is the total for this Plus this.

33
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.350
So these two values here some up to 1,474,967.

34
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.930
So this is how you can perform a percentage of wrote a little calculation in pivot tables
