00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Hey,

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,550
guys,

3
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,150
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,060
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,740
we're going to see how we can create a running total in pivot tables says you can see here

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,860
we get a pivot table here.

7
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,560
We've got the sales month spread across the columns,

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,060
and we got the year in the region here on the road section,

9
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,830
and we get the submission of sales amount on this emission of value section.

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,510
And what we want to do is to create a running total here across the months so that the

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,110
value on each month would represent the value of the sales year to date.

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,810
So the value of the sales so far in that particular year.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,090
So,

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,640
for example,

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,450
January would have the value for the sales in January,

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,070
but February would have the value for the sales in January plus February on then.

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,500
Marsh would have the value for the sales in January,

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,030
plus Ribery plus marsh.

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,600
So it's a year to date value.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,550
So to do that,

21
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,610
we're actually gonna insert another instance here off the sales amount on the submission of

22
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,460
Value section.

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,810
We're going to click on it,

24
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,400
go to value field settings here and then go to show values as and then on this menu,

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,900
Instead of no calculation,

26
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,450
we're going to select a running total in,

27
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,990
and then we have to select our base field.

28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,680
So the base field is the field that we're gonna base our accumulation of values on.

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,710
So the field,

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,550
actually that we want the values to accumulate on is this sales month,

31
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,850
right?

32
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,310
Because we want January to have the value for January and then February to have the value

33
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,910
for January plus bribery and the marsh to have the value for January plus robbery plus

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,750
marsh So we're gonna base are accumulation of values here on this sales month,

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,070
and then we're going to give it a custom name.

36
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,880
So we're gonna write running total and then dash months and then we're gonna click,

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,570
OK,

38
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,580
and now let's examine what happens.

39
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,090
We're gonna take this row here for Europe in 2016 as an example.

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,830
So the submission of sales amount here in January is 244,946.

41
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,340
The running total is the same because so far in 2016 in Europe,

42
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,590
we've only been through January.

43
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,070
But then,

44
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,100
if you look at February.

45
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,600
The value for the sales in February is 29,549 and then the running total is actually the

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,480
value for the sales in January,

47
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,650
plus for every 274,495.

48
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,880
So it's basically this value plus this value value for January plus February and then Marsh

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,830
the sales in it World's 54,556.

50
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:30,580
But the running total is 329,000 and 51 which is the value for sales for Marsh plus

51
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,530
February plus January and so on and so forth.

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,250
So as you can see here,

53
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,480
we got a running total across the months.

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,880
We can also have a running total here across the reasons,

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,530
for example,

56
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,180
so that we would have the sales here for America's and then here in Australia would have

57
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,850
sales for Australia plus America's and then in Europe would have the sails for America's

58
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,950
plus Australia.

59
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,480
Plus,

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,730
you're so to do that,

61
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,130
we're gonna insert another instance here of the sales amount.

62
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,840
Click on it,

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,580
go to value field settings here,

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,750
go to show values as instead of no calculation.

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,900
We're going to select a running total in and then we have to select our base field here as

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,920
the region because we want the values to accumulate across the regions here.

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,360
And then we're gonna name this running total region and we're going to click.

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,920
OK,

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,470
and as you can see her on the running tool region,

70
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,620
we have the sales accumulating across the reasons.

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,260
So because here in the Americans in 2016 cells with zero on,

72
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,400
then in Australia it was 85,000.

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,150
So this the accumulation so far is 85,000.

74
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,770
But then here in Europe,

75
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,500
we have the accumulation of Europe plus Australia plus America's sales in Europe where

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,040
244,946.

77
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,020
But the value here in the running total you can see here it's 330,000 181.

78
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,060
So basically you can accumulate values across any field if you selected to be your base

79
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,810
field here.

80
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,770
So that's it,

81
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,130
guys,

82
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,380
for creating a running total in pivot tables.

83
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,350
Thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one
