00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
and this video,

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.870
we're going to show a nice trick that you can use when you suspect that you have wrong

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.740
numbers on your pivot tables are on your data.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.010
So,

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.610
for example,

6
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.020
here in our sales for product one in 2016 it's 1,095,430.

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.650
Let's say that you suspect that this number is incorrect.

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.990
Let's say that you should be two million,

9
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.630
for example,

10
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.470
not 1,095,000.

11
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.660
So in this case,

12
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.820
you can actually show or check the underlying data for this particular number by simply

13
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.700
double clicking on the cell.

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.670
As you can see here,

15
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.140
basically,

16
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.320
Excel has created in you worksheet that contains the data on Lee for that particular number

17
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.320
,

18
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.320
so it contains only the underlying data for product one and in 2000 and 16 and then you can

19
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.760
check the numbers for the sales amount and see where the error is.

20
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.580
However,

21
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.420
if you need to make any changes,

22
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.720
you cannot make them in this sheet because this sheet is not linked to the pivot table.

23
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.540
This is just a new sheet that Excel has dumped the data underlying this cell here or the

24
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.430
number in.

25
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.460
But actually,

26
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.950
if you need to make any changes,

27
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.350
you need to make them on your data sheet.

28
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.980
So actually,

29
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.630
all press control NZ on my keyboard here,

30
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.190
too.

31
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.840
Remove that sheet,

32
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.320
and then if you need to make any changes,

33
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.900
you can go to your data and make the changes there.

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.270
Okay,

35
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.540
so this is a nice tip for you if you need to check the data underlying a certain number on

36
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.820
your pivot table if you suspect that this number is incorrect or having an error,

37
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.330
So thanks,

38
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.550
guys,

39
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.180
for watching,

40
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.530
and I'll see you on the next one.
