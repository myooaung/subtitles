00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
Now we're gonna explode the different types of pivot charts that we can create out of a

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.220
pivot table.

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.660
So if we click anywhere inside a pivot table and then goto insert tab here and then click

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.040
on recommended charge,

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.170
you can see here that we're able to see the different types of pivot charts that we can

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.540
create out of this pivot table so we can get a column chart as we did before.

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.240
We can also create a line chart.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.950
We can create a pie chart.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.760
We can create a bar chart and area chart,

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.570
but if we click on X Y scatter,

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.610
you can see her that it's telling us that you cannot create this chart type with data

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.020
inside a pivot table Police act a different chart type or copy the data outside the pivot

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.350
table.

14
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.260
If you click on the map chart,

15
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.360
it's the same thing.

16
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.390
Stock chart.

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.560
We cannot create the chart surface.

18
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.710
We can actually create the chart radar.

19
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.650
We can dream up.

20
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.010
We cannot sunburst.

21
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.230
We cannot history,

22
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.650
Graham.

23
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.500
We cannot build box and whisker.

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.580
We cannot water ful.

25
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.170
We cannot funnel chart.

26
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.220
We can't as well on this option for combo is for having two different Siris on the same

27
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.620
church,

28
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.030
so I'll actually choose to create a bar chart.

29
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.290
And I'm just going to click OK,

30
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.620
here says you can see here.

31
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.150
I managed to create a bar chart.

32
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm just gonna expander a little here in order for it to look better.

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.850
So now we've created our bar chart.

34
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.610
We also have the option to hide these buttons so these buttons are used to filter your

35
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.540
pivot chart.

36
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.140
However,

37
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.300
usually I do not filter my pivot chart from these buttons.

38
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.750
I usually do it either through the pivot table or through a slicer.

39
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.560
So in order to hide these buttons,

40
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.390
you can just click on the chart itself and then go to pivot chart,

41
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.860
analyze stab here and then field buttons.

42
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.240
You can just click on high,

43
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.270
told to hide older buttons and then click again and UnTech the height all in order to show

44
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.100
all the buttons.

45
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.510
You could also hide the buttons individually.

46
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.330
If you right click on a particular button here and then hide Legend Field button on the

47
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.790
chart.

48
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.580
This heights the legend field button.

49
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.820
If you need to re enable it,

50
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.980
click on field buttons here and then show legend field buttons again,

51
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.450
and you can do the same for the other two buttons as well.

52
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.900
You can also switch to a different type of chart on the fly so you can just simply click on

53
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.710
the chart Ray.

54
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.260
Click on,

55
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.230
then change chart type.

56
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.860
And then here you can switch to another chart type so you can click on the pie chart here,

57
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.380
for example,

58
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.280
and click OK,

59
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.200
and now you switched your chart to a pie chart size.

60
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.690
It is here you can Onley create certain types of charts out of your pivot table and also

61
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.650
your ableto hide your field buttons,

62
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.490
and you're also able to switch your pivot chart types on the fly.

63
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.690
So thanks guys watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
