00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
in this video,

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.500
we're going to speak about the connections between slices and pivot tables and how to

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.440
control multiple pivot tables with a slicer Says you can see here,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.990
I've got a pivot table here and have got 1/4 slicer and Aiken slice the data on the pivot

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.650
table using this quarter slicer.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.320
So when I click on a certain quarter,

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.690
only the data for that quarter shows on the pivot table.

8
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.390
Now,

9
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.240
if I insert another pivot table so I'll go to my data top here and then goto insert a pivot

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.330
table and then I'm gonna actually insert it so that it would be just here on the right hand

11
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.640
site and then click OK,

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.050
here.

13
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.970
And let's say I'm gonna put the product name and the sales amount here on the second pivot

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.410
table.

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.280
If I choose a different value here on the quarter slicer,

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.870
you can see here that the pivot table on the right is not being sliced now to connect the

17
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.410
pivot table on the right to the quarter slicer.

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.620
What I need to do is to go to the slicer connections.

19
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.650
So if a click on the slicer here and then go to slicer and then click on report connections

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.650
.

21
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.540
You guys here,

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.820
we've got Pivot table one,

23
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.040
which is the one on the left.

24
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.430
And we've got another pivot table,

25
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.180
which is pivot table to which is actually the one on the right here so you could see her

26
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.450
under pivot table analyzed because here the name of the pivot tables pivot table two.

27
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.600
So if I go to the slicer connections and another way it can go to them is to right,

28
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.330
click and then in the middle here,

29
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.750
click on report connections.

30
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.710
If I check the check box for pivot table to here and click OK,

31
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.790
I can connect the slicer here to the other pivot table is well,

32
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.570
so now the slicer in the middle.

33
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.310
It actually controls both pivot tables,

34
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.150
as you can see here.

35
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.030
And I can insert another slicer here so I can insert a another slicer for the region.

36
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.840
For examples,

37
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.790
insert and that go to slicer and then insert a slicer for the region.

38
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.320
And now this region slicer only controls the pivot table on the right,

39
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.550
which is pivot table two.

40
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.750
But I can make it control the other one as well,

41
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.150
right.

42
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.970
Click report connections and then check Pivot table one on.

43
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.140
Now,

44
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.670
both slicers control both pivot tables.

45
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.870
So,

46
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.550
as you can see here,

47
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.890
this is how you can create connections between your slicers and your pivot tables and

48
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.160
control multiple pivot tables by one or more slicers.

49
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.840
You need to note,

50
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.280
though,

51
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.940
that the data source for all the pivot tables should be the same in order to be able to

52
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.950
control different pivot tables with one slice.

53
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.420
So you need to make sure that all the pivot tables have the same data source.

54
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.450
You cannot have a slicer control to pivot tables that have two different data sources

55
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.250
unless you actually go to part of it and the data model.

56
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.260
But that's a totally different story.

57
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.010
Okay,

58
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.400
so thank you guys for watching this video,

59
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.950
and I'll see you on the next one
