00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Okay,

2
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.890
So the third step here for preparing your data for creating a pivot table out of it is to

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.770
form it each column properly.

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.290
So you should check each column that contains the number or each column that contains the

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.320
date and make sure that you formatted properly.

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.490
So,

7
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.020
for example,

8
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.620
this is the sales amount here.

9
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.270
This is not formatted properly because it's just numbers.

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.130
Eso it's better to add a coma,

11
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.690
actually.

12
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.210
And maybe if there is a currency,

13
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.360
you could add a currency here.

14
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.880
So English,

15
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.150
United States or English,

16
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.010
Canada or so?

17
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.820
So you had a currency to it,

18
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.840
And there couple zeros you can remove here,

19
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.050
using these arrows here for the decimal places.

20
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.480
And then there is the order date column here,

21
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.630
so Excel actually treats dates as numbers.

22
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.800
So sometimes on the column containing your dates,

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.010
you might see numbers.

24
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.060
These numbers actually re present your dates,

25
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.470
but they are not formatted properly,

26
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.150
so if you need to format them properly,

27
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.960
you need to select your column here and then go to this number format,

28
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.810
drop down menu and then select short date.

29
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.830
So this form,

30
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.360
it's your dates properly,

31
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.740
and please note that all my PC here I've got my dates formatted in the European way.

32
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.150
So it's day,

33
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.750
month,

34
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.360
year,

35
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.720
so on your PC.

36
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.100
If you're in the US,

37
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.750
you might have your dates format it as month,

38
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.830
day year.

39
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.080
Okay,

40
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.330
so now that we've fermented our data properly,

41
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
we can start creating our pivot table.

42
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.140
So I'm gonna press control in a on my keyboard here,

43
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.270
just like my data and an insert,

44
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.280
a pivot table.

45
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.400
And then I'm gonna click OK to create a pivot table in a new worksheet.

46
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.990
And that's it.

47
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.580
So we've completed the final step here for preparing our data for creating a pivot table

48
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.160
out of it.

49
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.040
This step will help you troubleshoot any issues with your data in the future.

50
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.790
So having proper form,

51
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.310
it is a general best practice when preparing your data
