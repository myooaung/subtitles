00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120
Hey,

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,370
guys,

3
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,960
welcome back.

4
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,860
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,330
we're going to see how we can connect to and re fresh external data.

6
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,290
So let's say you've got a file that you share with your colleagues,

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,750
and it's sitting on a server somewhere.

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,340
So let's say we've got this file here,

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,680
which is gold external data that sits in a server.

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,260
That's emissions.

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,930
This foul sits in the server,

12
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,120
and you need to connect to the data in that file.

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,060
So this files teams data and you need to connect to it.

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,370
So actually you can insert a pivot table and then you're gonna click on use X,

15
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,900
an external data source,

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,890
and click on Choose Connection here.

17
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,270
And then you're gonna click on,

18
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,020
browse for more and then browse to your Felda fell a cheese on my desktop.

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,580
So I'm just gonna browse for it here external data,

20
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,390
and I'm gonna double click on it.

21
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,410
As you can see here,

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,410
we have a view here that shows us the tabs inside that file,

23
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,860
and we've got only one top,

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,840
which is called Data,

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,090
and the first wrote of the data contains columns and headers.

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,120
It's just the same day that we've been using.

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,450
But it's in this external data file.

28
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm gonna click OK,

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:02,940
here.

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,160
So you're going to choose the top where your data lies and you're gonna click,

31
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,680
OK,

32
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
and then click OK again.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,460
And now we're able to connect to that file with the external data,

34
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,270
and we're gonna be able to construct a pivot table using the data in that particular file.

35
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,950
So I'm gonna put the product name here on the Rose and put the sales amount on the value

36
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,400
section and you're able to connect that file.

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,290
And if the data on the external data file changes,

38
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,840
you can always refresh it as usual by right clicking and then clicking on refresh here.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,630
And there are some options as well that you want to show you.

40
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,160
So I'm going to right click on my pivot table and then click on Pivot Table Options year

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,590
and then on the data top.

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,910
There is an option here that says refresh data when opening the file.

43
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,400
So if you check the option and click OK,

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,490
whenever you open your new file that has the pivot table connected to your external data

45
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:51,940
file,

46
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,970
Excel will refresh the pivot tables in the new file.

47
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,490
So this is also a useful feature,

48
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,510
since it always make sure that your pivot tables are refreshed whenever you open the file

49
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,950
that is connected to the external data file.

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,560
Okay,

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,180
so that's it,

52
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,640
guys,

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,380
this is how you can connect to data in an external pile or an external data source.

54
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,880
So thanks,

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,610
guys watching I'll see on the next one.
