00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Now we're going to discuss calculated feels in pivot tables.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,070
So calculated fields are virtual columns that you can create in pivot tables where usually

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,480
perform calculations so they are essentially virtual calculated columns.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,500
These columns do not exist initially on your data,

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,400
but you actually create them from feels or columns.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,310
In your data.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,870
You can even create calculated columns that depend on other calculated columns.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,260
So to create a calculated column,

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,990
you need to select your pivot table,

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,790
first of all,

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,510
and then on the ribbon,

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,280
you will have the pivot table,

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,790
analyze top or on other Excel versions.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,820
It might be cold.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,160
Just analyze,

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,260
and then you go here to fields,

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,620
items and sets.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,760
Under Calculations group,

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,850
you go to fields,

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,750
items and sets,

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,520
and then you click on calculated,

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,990
healed.

23
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,100
And first of all,

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,560
you have to enter the name of the field like you need to give it a name,

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,050
so I'll give it a name of colleagues.

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,570
It's basically going to be the cost of goods sold,

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:20,000
and we do have here the fields the are available in our data or the columns are available

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,740
in our data set and the cost of goods sold should be the cost divided by this sales amount

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,740
.

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,440
And in calculated fields,

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,250
you can use the standard mathematical operations in Excel.

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,880
So the plus sign the miners,

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,860
the division,

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,040
the multiplication sign you can even use greater than unless than comparison operators.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,650
However,

36
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,830
I've never had a case where I needed to use them.

37
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,560
But you might have a case to do so.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,360
So you can basically use the standard mathematical operators that use in Excel.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,390
So this is gonna be are calculated field and with the guts to naming the calculated field.

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,650
There are different practices that people do.

41
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:11,180
So some people put an asterisk before the name so that this would denote the it is a

42
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,100
calculated field.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,360
I personally like to name it as Calcutta before the name of it.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
I mean,

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,350
different people do different things and you can choose whatever you would like to do and

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,640
then press OK,

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,280
here and now we do have are calculated field here,

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,070
which is the cost of goods sold,

49
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,650
and this should be a percentage.

50
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,730
So we're just gonna change the number formats or right click number format,

51
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,970
and we're gonna choose percentage here and click OK,

52
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,160
as you can see here now we have the percentage,

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,370
which is the cost of goods sold here.

54
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,280
And as you can see here,

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
it says some off talc cost of goods sold.

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,990
You could even change its name here,

57
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,920
the title on it so that it wouldn't say some off.

58
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,120
So click on the field itself,

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,510
go to value field settings and then you just name it whatever you want,

60
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,160
so I can name it.

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,620
For example,

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:14,680
Astra's cost of goods sold and click OK here so that it would show as this name as you can

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:14,970
see her.

64
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,450
And it has the Astros before it just to denote that it is a calculated field.

65
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,410
Okay,

66
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,630
so this is basically how you can create a calculated field.

67
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,700
Calculated fields are basically calculated columns.

68
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,420
The are based on either the columns currently existing on the table,

69
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,740
or they can also be based on other calculated fields
