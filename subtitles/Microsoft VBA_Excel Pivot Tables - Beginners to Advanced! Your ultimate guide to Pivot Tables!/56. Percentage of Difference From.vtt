00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
in this video,

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.210
we're going to explain the percentage difference from calculation.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.650
So this is similar to the difference from calculation.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.230
Except the result is a percentage.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
It calculates the percentage off difference instead of giving us just the difference.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.900
So see that with an example.

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.840
Let's do the same thing here that we've done on the previous video on the difference from

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.250
video.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.830
So I'm gonna calculate the difference between a particular month and the previous month.

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.230
So I'm gonna drag another instance here of the submission of the sales amount and then

11
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.920
click on it,

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.360
go to value field settings,

13
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.320
click on show values as.

14
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.000
And then instead of no calculation,

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.010
I'm gonna select percentage difference from,

16
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.290
and it's gonna be the difference from the base field being the sales month and then

17
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.910
previous.

18
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.780
So now we're going to get the percentage of difference between a particular month and the

19
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.620
previous month,

20
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.530
and we're going to give it a custom name percentage difference from previous month,

21
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.740
and we're going to click OK,

22
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.160
here.

23
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.590
So,

24
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.550
as you can see here,

25
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.690
this is giving us the percentage of difference between a particular month and a previous

26
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.140
month.

27
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.250
So the calculation here being done is,

28
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.940
for example,

29
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.770
for February 2016 were actually subtracting the value of January,

30
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.070
which is 330,181 from February.

31
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.450
So it's 29,549 minus 330,000 181.

32
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.510
So we're going to get the difference this way.

33
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.280
And then we're gonna divide that by 330,000 181 which is the value for previous month.

34
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.620
Okay,

35
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.360
so it's basically current month minus previous month,

36
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.830
divided by previous month.

37
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.650
So this is what gives us the result here.

38
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.990
And the result here is negative.

39
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.350
91.5%.

40
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.660
Same goes for march,

41
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.090
for example here 313% 3130.51.

42
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.980
So that's basically current 1 122,189 minus previous month,

43
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.430
which is 29,549 divided by previous month,

44
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.200
which is 29549th and this gives us 313 0.51%.

45
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.900
We could also do the percentage difference from previous year.

46
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.880
We're gonna drag another instance here of the sales amount,

47
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.750
go to some,

48
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.460
click on it,

49
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.760
go to value field settings and then show values as and then here,

50
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.980
the percentage difference from and the base field here.

51
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.650
We're going to select the year and we're going to select for the previous year.

52
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.890
Click OK here.

53
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.640
And as you can see here we get the percentage of difference from previous year.

54
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.130
So here,

55
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.810
for example,

56
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.270
negative 39.64% is basically the value for January 17 minus the value for January 16

57
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.350
divided by the value for January 16th.

58
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.590
This gives us negative 39.64% on actually forgot to rename it here.

59
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.700
So I'm going to rename it,

60
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.740
which is percentage difference from previous year and click OK,

61
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.180
here.

62
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.180
As you can see here,

63
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.550
this is the percentage difference from previous year.

64
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.800
And we can give a custom number formatting here for two columns,

65
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.570
So I'm going to select them and then press control and one on my keyboard and then go to

66
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.910
custom here and then for the custom number,

67
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.940
formatting is gonna be 0.0% for positive numbers,

68
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.140
and then I'm gonna put a semi colon and then for the negative numbers year is gonna be

69
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.650
negative 0.0%.

70
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.960
And then with red in between square brackets.

71
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.650
And this means that there get of numbers,

72
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.980
will have a red phone.

73
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.550
12 positive numbers will have a black fund,

74
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.970
and the negative numbers will have the negative sign as well.

75
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.000
And if you need to learn more about custom number formatting and understand exactly what

76
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.280
these symbols mean,

77
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.480
I have a video on my YouTube channel,

78
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.010
the Excel custom number formatting masterclass,

79
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.470
where I show you everything about because the number formatting and what these symbols mean

80
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.470
.

81
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.250
So I'd recommend you watch this video.

82
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.360
It's just that this course is not a custom number formatting Course,

83
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.580
I'm not going to go into detail about the topic,

84
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.980
and I'll leave you The link for the YouTube video in the Resource is section.

85
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.170
So I'm gonna click OK,

86
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.530
here.

87
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.650
And as you can see here,

88
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.450
we now managed to color the negative numbers in red.

89
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.040
We could also do the same thing here about comparing to the Americas as we did on the

90
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.940
previous video.

91
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.860
So I'm going to drag another instance here of the sales amount and then click on it,

92
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.150
value fuel settings and then show values as.

93
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.920
And then instead of no calculation,

94
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.340
we're gonna be doing percentage difference from And then the base field is gonna be the

95
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.210
region and that it's gonna be compared to the Americas,

96
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.560
So percentage difference from America's.

97
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.930
And then we're gonna click.

98
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.430
OK,

99
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.930
here.

100
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.010
As you can see here we get the percentage of difference from the Americas.

101
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.990
So this number here is basically the sales for Australia,

102
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.270
minus the sails for America's divided by the sales for America's.

103
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.910
And now we can give our column here some custom number formatting.

104
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.910
So I'm going to select it,

105
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.790
press control and one on my keyboard and then go to custom here,

106
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:24.170
and then it's gonna be 0.0% and then a semi colon and then negative 0.0% with red in

107
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.440
between square brackets and I'm gonna click OK,

108
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.930
here.

109
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.950
As you can see here,

110
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.210
our negative differences here have been highlighted in red and again.

111
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.640
If you need to learn more about custom number formatting,

112
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.300
I'll leave you the link for my YouTube video.

113
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.770
And the resource is section.

114
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.220
Okay,

115
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.750
so that's it,

116
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.020
guys.

117
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.700
For the percentage of difference from calculation.

118
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.410
Thank you very much for watching this video.

119
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.380
I'll see on the next.
