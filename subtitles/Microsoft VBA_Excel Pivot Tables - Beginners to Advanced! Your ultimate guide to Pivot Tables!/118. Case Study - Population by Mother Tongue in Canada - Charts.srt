1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Okay,

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,120
so now let's create some charts out off our pivot tables.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,110
So I'm just gonna create in you worksheet here.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,600
I'm just gonna name it charts,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,380
for example,

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,030
and I'm gonna remove the grid lines year.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:19,410
So I'm gonna go to view and then untech the grid lines here to make it look a bit cleaner.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,240
And then I'm gonna go to my pivot tables here.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,830
I'm going to take my first pivot table.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,220
I'm gonna goto insert,

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,160
and then I'm gonna actually create a column chart out of that.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,170
So I'm gonna create a clustered column chart out of that here because here,

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,640
a short was created and then are actually going to remove these buttons year because I

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,420
don't like them.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,610
They obstruct the view here on the chart and just gonna make it a bit cleaner.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,020
I'm also gonna remove these grid lines year by selecting them impressing delete all my

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,670
keyboard,

18
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,880
and then I'm actually going to cut that chart and then I'm gonna paste it.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,450
Any new worksheet here.

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,550
And so this chart we can give it a title here so we can add a chart title here,

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,940
and the chart title would be we could make it mother tongue speakers overall in Canada,

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,900
and we can make it a percentage of mother tongue speaking speakers.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,240
Percentage of mother tongue speakers year overall in Canada.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,460
So,

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,250
as you can see here,

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,060
it shows the percentage of people who speak a certain mother tongue overall in Canada.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,960
So here if,

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,630
for example,

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,470
we add the data labels for everything.

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,440
So let's add the deal labels for the different ones here,

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,410
the different colors here on for the languages.

32
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,750
You can see here that these data data labels,

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:53,420
for example it says here it's 26.61% off the people in Canada who speak English.

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,790
They live in Ontario,

35
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,580
and I'm also gonna actually cut and paste the slicer as well.

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,350
So I'm gonna cut it,

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,210
and then I'm gonna paste it so control and X and control and be here,

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,590
and this will enable me as well to control the numbers on the chart.

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,050
You can see here that the data labels they are starting to overlap here,

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,340
and they're starting to look ugly.

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,090
And I'll show you how we can go around that and make it look much better and more readable

42
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:22,090
.

43
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,890
So I'm going to do this same,

44
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,400
actually,

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,950
for the other charts as well.

46
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,560
So I'm just gonna go to the pivot table here,

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,730
Insert on.

48
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,840
Then I'm gonna insert another chart here.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,990
Another pivot chart.

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,590
I'm going to remove the buttons,

51
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,250
and I'm going to remove these grid lines.

52
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,330
I'm gonna cut it,

53
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,510
and I'm gonna paste it.

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:51,290
And this time is going to be the percentage of province population per mother tongue in

55
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,760
Canada.

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,220
Her mother tongue in Canada.

57
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,590
Right.

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,910
So now we're gonna add the data labels here for each one I'm going to show you as well how

59
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,630
to work around these ugly data labels.

60
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,810
The are overlapping.

61
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,420
At the moment.

62
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,170
I'm going to do the same here for the 3rd 1 So insert.

63
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:19,650
And then I'm going to remove the buttons I'm going to remove as well the grid lines and

64
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,550
just gonna cut it and paste it here.

65
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,830
And now we're gonna name this one here percentage,

66
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,150
mother tongue speakers per province in Canada.

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,410
So now I'm gonna add the detail labels here gonna have the data labels for each one.

68
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,670
And now let's actually do a work around for these data labels So one of the easiest things

69
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,810
that you can do is that you can actually color the background or fill the background of the

70
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,850
data labels with the same color off the bar.

71
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,530
So here,

72
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,390
if I select the data label one of the data labels of the orange bars,

73
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,200
for example,

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,030
it will select all the data labels for the Orange Force,

75
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,890
and then I can goto format,

76
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,920
and then I can actually fill that shape with the orange color.

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
Okay,

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,650
so this way it's gonna be easy to distinguish the numbers for the orange one.

79
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,550
And maybe I could change the fund for that to be a white that's more readable.

80
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,660
And then I'm going to do the same here for the gray.

81
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,400
So again go.

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,060
So I'm gonna go to the format.

83
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,630
I'm gonna make it gray here.

84
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,900
Maybe a darker gray.

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,630
Right.

86
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,600
So this way you're able to distinguish here the numbers for the gray ones,

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,450
and,

88
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,330
uh,

89
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,680
I'm going to do the same here for the blue.

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,550
Maybe a bit of a lighter blue here.

91
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,790
Yeah,

92
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,450
and maybe I can make the front whites as well.

93
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,470
Well,

94
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,880
maybe we could make the blue a bit darker in this case here.

95
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,590
Yeah,

96
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,480
so that there would be more contrast.

97
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,010
Well,

98
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,570
they're still overlap,

99
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,280
but the effect of the overlap has been reduced a lot by coloring the background off the

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,630
data label right there,

101
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,060
more,

102
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,220
much more readable now.

103
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,100
And even if you want to zoom onto one of them,

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,460
you're going to be able to read it much easier,

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,100
right?

106
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,410
You can even move one of them here.

107
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,000
You at least you know what?

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,250
You're moving right?

109
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,340
And it's much easier to read these data labels from Ellen.

110
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,120
So I'm going to do the same for the other charts as well.

111
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Okay,

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,380
guys of then this same for the other charts as well.

113
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,950
And we can also make the background of the whole chart transparent so that it would be,

114
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,460
you know,

115
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,170
it would show what's behind it and,

116
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,520
of course,

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,150
what's behind it.

118
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,490
It's just a white matt here,

119
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,630
But you know,

120
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,250
if you have a different color this way,

121
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,620
it would show the color underneath it if you want to do that,

122
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,110
so I just show you how to do that.

123
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,550
The easiest way to do it is to select the whole chart and then press control and one on

124
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,200
your keyboard.

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,100
Or you can also right click and Goto format chart area.

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,680
And then on the Phil here,

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,350
you got to do no no feel,

128
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,360
and you can do no under the border.

129
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,340
You do know lines.

130
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,010
So now the chart is pretty much transparent and it shows what's behind it.

131
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,750
And you can do the same for the other two charts as well.

132
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,920
No,

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,450
Phil,

134
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,210
no line And no Phil,

135
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,250
no line here.

136
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,640
All right.

137
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,570
And now these charts are being controlled by the slicer.

138
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,020
You can also off course change the color of your slicer.

139
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,330
May be the gray would be a bit better here.

140
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,480
You would lend with everything.

141
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,400
So as you can see here,

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,070
we managed to create some sort of Ah ah,

143
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,860
quick dashboard here,

144
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,510
if you will.

145
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,170
This is not like a really complex dashboard.

146
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,430
I do actually teach dashboards on another course,

147
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,880
and maybe you could watch that and we use pivot tables a lot.

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,030
But this is kind of a quick dashboard that you can create a quick report,

149
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,680
if you will,

150
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,330
for your manager.

151
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,130
If you need to create something like that on the fly.

152
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,660
It's easy with pivot tables,

153
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,490
as you can see here,

154
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,200
and but you can draw some conclusions out of that data.

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,910
You're able to look at your data from different perspectives,

156
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,970
as we explained,

157
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,710
and that is the beauty of pivot tables.

158
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,140
Indeed.

159
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,590
All right,

160
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,090
so thank you guys watching this video on.

161
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,390
I'll see you on the next one.
