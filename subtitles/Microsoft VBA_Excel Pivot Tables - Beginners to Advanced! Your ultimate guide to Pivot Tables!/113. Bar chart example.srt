1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,130
Okay,

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,590
so let's so another type of chart here,

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,790
which is the bar chart.

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,360
So I've got my data here on May Pivot Table.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,720
I've got the sales people on the roast section.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,350
I've got the sales amount on the submission of value section,

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,200
and I've got the product name on the column section,

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,480
and we're going to create a bit of a more sophisticated chart in this video.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,870
So I'm actually going to select here a cell inside my pivot table.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,290
I'm gonna go to the insert tab on the ribbon,

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,090
and then I'm going to go here to this area here,

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,900
which is the column and bar charts,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,360
and then I'm gonna select a clustered bar chart.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,330
So here I created a clustered bar chart,

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,270
as you can see here.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,610
And as you can see here,

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,490
there are many sales people here on my team.

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:54,750
So maybe I just want to focus on the top five salespeople in terms of sales amount,

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,340
so I can actually filter here using this button,

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,480
I can click on it,

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,740
and then I can go to value filters,

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,150
and then I'm going I can go to top 10 and then I'm actually going to change the top 10 toe

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,150
.

24
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,570
Only top five people by sales amount.

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,000
Here,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,300
top five items by sales amount.

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,830
I'm gonna click OK here.

28
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,320
So,

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
as you can see here,

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,600
my pivot chart has been filtered to include only the top five people.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,150
And the tough I people have been selected based on this grand total column.

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,600
So it's just the top five people by grand total.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
And now on this chart,

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,250
I can see here the top performing sales people and I can see the breakdown of their sales

35
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:37,620
as well.

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,500
Byproduct.

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,200
So I can see who has been able to sell which product the most as well.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,700
I can give my charts and data labels year so I can right click and then add data labels and

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,470
add my data labels year.

40
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,810
I can do that for every item here for every product.

41
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,920
So I can click on that product here and add the data labels to it,

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,340
and what I can do as well to make it easier to read.

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,880
The labels here is to give some number formatting here to my numbers here so I can just

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,610
give it a currency formatting here and that would make it much easier for me to read my

45
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,060
numbers.

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,980
And Onizuka sear the number formatting on my ex accesses well changed to be the same as the

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,350
number formatting All my numbers as well.

48
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,270
I can clean my chart up a bit more here if I can just right click on any of these field

49
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,720
buttons,

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,280
and then I'm gonna hide all the fuel buttons on the chart.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,910
It makes it much easier to read the chart.

52
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,510
I will also remove my vertical grid lines here are click on them and press delete on the

53
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,150
keyboard,

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,970
and that would make my chart much easier to read as well.

55
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,120
And,

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,640
of course,

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,860
this pivot chart would interact with my pivot table.

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,270
So if I decide to remove the product name here and add the region instead on the column

59
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,790
section,

60
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:11,320
you can see here that the pivot chart reacts to whatever changes I make on the pivot table

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,320
.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,880
So,

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,560
as you can see here,

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,270
this is a bit of a more complex chart here that we managed to create by having elements in

65
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,800
both at the Rose section and the columns section,

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,850
as well off the pivot table
