00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
and this video are going to speak about changing our fueled names.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.730
So here we've got our pivot table and let's say I want to change the name of a field here,

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.380
which is the sum of sales amount.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's say I want to change it to just sales amount.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.370
So if I click on this arrow here and click on value fueled settings and try to change it to

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.480
sales amount,

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.890
I'm press okay.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.310
Actually,

9
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.550
I'm going to get an error.

10
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.860
And the reason for that is that the original name of the field,

11
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.660
which is the same thing as a column.

12
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.710
So the original name of the field or the column here on your data table is sales amount.

13
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.210
So you're trying to assigning the same name of an already existing field.

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.790
So this is why you're getting an error.

15
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.900
So to get around that you Congar back to value fueled settings and you can make it sales

16
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.290
amount.

17
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.920
But just add an extra space here,

18
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.970
impress okay,

19
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.490
and Excel will accept that it will recognize this name as a different name than the one

20
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.580
that you have on your original data table.

21
00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.980
Of course,

22
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.200
you can change it to any other name if you'd like,

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.430
so you can go back and make it total sales,

24
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.100
for example,

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.210
and that's totally acceptable.

26
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.150
Another way to change field names is through the anal ice tab on the ribbon.

27
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.280
So while clicking inside your pivot table,

28
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950
go to the analyzed type on the ribbon.

29
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.130
You can see here that the latest name we've assigned to the sales column has been reflected

30
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.550
here on the active field.

31
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.230
It says,

32
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.130
Total sales.

33
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.300
Let's say I want to change my year to sales year,

34
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.030
for example,

35
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.370
and I can do that and press enter and the name has been reflected here is well on my pivot

36
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.080
table field,

37
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.420
Spain.

38
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.690
You can see here it's now sails year instead of year.

39
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.320
So this is how you can change your field names on your pivot table.
