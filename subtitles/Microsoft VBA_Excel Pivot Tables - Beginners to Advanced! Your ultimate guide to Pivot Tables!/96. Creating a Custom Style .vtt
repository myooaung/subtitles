00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
in this video,

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.430
we're going to speak about creating a custom style for your slicer.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.910
So if you don't like any of the styles here that you have for slicers,

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.140
you're able to create your own custom style.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.060
You can do so by clicking on new slicer style.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.450
And then I'm gonna name it my awesome style and then here for the whole slicer.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.200
I'm going to give it this light green and then I'm gonna click.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.790
OK,

9
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.420
you're able to also change the border and the fund.

10
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.730
But I'm not going to change those.

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.260
I'm gonna click,

12
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.980
OK here and then the header.

13
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.660
I'm going to give it a slightly darker green here and click OK,

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.190
and then for selected item with data,

15
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.690
I'm going to give it a dark green and I'm gonna change the phone Tier two white and I'm

16
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.590
gonna click OK,

17
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.670
here for selected item with no data,

18
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.880
I am going to give it a gray color here and click OK,

19
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.640
and for UN selected item with data,

20
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.450
I'm gonna give it just a wait and instructed item with no data as well gonna give it a

21
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.810
white fail and then the hovered selected item with data.

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.690
So anything covered?

23
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.950
I'm just gonna give it orange here and click.

24
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.680
OK,

25
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.880
anything hovered orange,

26
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.890
This one is gonna be orange as well.

27
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.140
And this one is gonna be orange.

28
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.160
And then you if you want this to be the default slicer,

29
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.870
start for the document or for your workbook.

30
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.440
You can just check this check box,

31
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.730
but we're not going to check it here.

32
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.310
I'm gonna cook,

33
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.930
Okay.

34
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.970
And now,

35
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.350
to apply the style that you created,

36
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.720
here's the style I need to make sure to select your slicer and then click on your style

37
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.550
here and then the style you created has been applied.

38
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.300
So now,

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.880
as you can see her,

40
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.600
there is this orange hover here that we selected and you're able to apply it to the other

41
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.450
slices as well.

42
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.370
So I'm going to select the other slicers and apply the custom style here says you can see

43
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.260
her now.

44
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.830
I have my custom style apply to all the slicers.

45
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.810
And as you can see here,

46
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.840
these air selected items with no data on these air.

47
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.360
The UN selected items with no data here,

48
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.320
there in white and then selected items with data and then un selected items with data.

49
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.780
They are in grey and so on.

50
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.870
So is against here.

51
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.970
This the slicer has taken the style that we created.

52
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.440
And if there is a certain style from the ready mate styles or the default styles here that

53
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.860
you like,

54
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.610
But you just want to modify slightly,

55
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.020
you can just right click on it and then duplicate it.

56
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.340
And I'm gonna need my awesome style two.

57
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.160
And then you can start modifying Get using the original style as a baseline.

58
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.950
But I'm gonna cancel it.

59
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.980
Okay,

60
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.550
So this is how you can create a custom style either by creating,

61
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.300
get from scratch or by using a ready made or built in style as a baseline case.

62
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.950
So thank you guys watching this video,

63
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.220
I now see on the next one.
