00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
if you need to show on higher do field headers such as thes row labels or column labels.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,140
So these headers here you can go to the anal.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,860
I step on the ribbon here after selecting a cell in your pivot table,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,870
and then you can see are a button that says Field Heather's.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,260
You can toggle the field headers on our off using that button.
