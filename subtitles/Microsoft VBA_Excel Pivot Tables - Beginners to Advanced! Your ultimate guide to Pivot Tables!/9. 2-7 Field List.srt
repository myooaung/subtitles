1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
Okay,

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,330
so that's speak a bit more about the field list.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,040
So another way to show on hide your field list is to actually right.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,370
Click on your pivot table here and then click on Hyatt Field List,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,220
and you can also right click again and then show your field lists and us another way to

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,930
show on high.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,930
Do you feel list?

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,030
In addition to using the fuel list button here under the anal,

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,510
I stab on the ribbon.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,610
If you need to move your field list,

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,590
you can actually click on this arrow here and then click on move,

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,380
and then you can start dragging and dropping your field list anywhere on the screen.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,700
If you need to dock it back to the right hand side of the screen,

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,790
you can just click and drag the field list year to the very right Hindsight and then Excel

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,390
will dock it automatically for you.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,710
Another way to docket after you move it.

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,280
So start moving again is to actually double click on it,

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,020
and this will also docket back to the right and site.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,710
If you need to resize your field list,

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,480
you can click on this arrow here and then click on size and you can start re sizing it.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,090
You can also move your mouse cursor to the edge of the fuel list,

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,800
and you will be converted to these two opposing arrows so you can just click and drag to

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,880
resize your field lists.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,660
Also on our field list,

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,090
we've got different views that we can choose from.

26
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,530
So here you can click on this gear icon here that says Tools.

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,690
And then you have different views for you feel list.

28
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,880
So we're currently on a view called Fuels Section in Areas Section Stack.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,180
There's another view that says Feel section in areas section side by sides.

30
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,930
Another one that says Fuel section on Lee and There's Areas section on Lee two by two.

31
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,400
And there is Area section on Lee won by four.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,190
However,

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,340
I personally prefer the first view.
