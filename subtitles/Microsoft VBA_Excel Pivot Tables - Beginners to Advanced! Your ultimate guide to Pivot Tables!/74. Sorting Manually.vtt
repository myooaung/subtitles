00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
he can also sort manually in pivot tables.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.870
So here I've got the list of my products and have got the sales amounts.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070
And let's say I want to put product one to be after product to,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.080
for example,

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.420
so I can hover over the corner here on Product one and press and hold on my mouse button

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.590
and you can see here the bar indicating the new position that it's gonna be moved to.

7
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.590
So if I release my mouse,

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.230
click here of be able to move it here so that you be between product to and product three,

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.360
another way to move it is to actually click on it and then right click and then go to move

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.840
on.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.470
Then here I could move it up or to the beginning or down one step or two.

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.030
The end.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.850
So say I'm going to move it one step upwards.

14
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.590
It's actually going to go to the beginning.

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.240
So here,

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.870
going to the beginning and up will yield the same result in this case.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.570
So if I move it one step up,

18
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.180
you can see here it's moved to the top again.

19
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.720
Another way to do it is to actually go ahead and type the name of your product here.

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.510
So product one like this and press enter because here it's been moved to the very bottom

21
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.780
here.

22
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.140
So there you go.

23
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.970
Three ways to manually sort your pivot tables.
