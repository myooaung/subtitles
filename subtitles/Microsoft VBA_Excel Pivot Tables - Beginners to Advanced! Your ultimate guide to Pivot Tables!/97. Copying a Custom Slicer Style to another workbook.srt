If you need to copy a custom slicer style from one workbook to another,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,550
there is no direct way of doing it in excel.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,130
However,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,330
there is a work around to do it.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,590
So I've got this workbook here where I don't have the custom slicer style.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,930
I've got the workbook that we had created on the PVS lesson where we created our custom

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,790
slicer style that you can see here and in order to copy the custom slicer style from this

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,070
workbook here to the new workbook,

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:36,560
I can just get any slicer from that workbook and then just copy it so control and see to

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,200
copy.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,210
And then I'm just gonna paste this new slicer here to my new workbook.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,180
And then I'm just gonna paste my slicer here to the new workbook.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,880
And then if you just click on any slicer here options,

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,310
you will see that the new customs slicer style is there and it can be applied on any slicer

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:04,510
here so you can apply to all the slicers if you want here and then you can just delete the

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,680
slicer that you had copied from the old workbook.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,150
OK,

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:17,580
this is how you can transfer or copy a custom slicer style from one workbook to another.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,190
So thank you so much for watching this video.

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,250
I'll see you on the next one.
