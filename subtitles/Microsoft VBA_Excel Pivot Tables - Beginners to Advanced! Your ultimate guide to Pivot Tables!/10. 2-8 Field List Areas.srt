1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,150
and this video,

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,470
we're going to speak about our field lists and our four different areas at the bottom.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,610
So if we go back to your data,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,750
you will see that the names off our column headers for a data match those off the pivot

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,650
table fields that we have here on our field list.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,720
Now at the bottom,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,590
we have our different fuel list areas.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,440
We have four different field ist area,

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,490
so you get the filters,

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,570
columns rose and values,

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,800
and in thes field list areas,

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,760
we can actually drag and drop any of our field.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,060
So let's say I want to put my product name on the row section.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,340
I can actually click on it and drag it and drop it in the row section.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,450
Alternatively,

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,040
there is a check box beside it,

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,510
and if I click on that check box so I can un check and then check again and you could see

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,640
her,

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,720
it's been inserted on the rose area.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,480
However,

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,540
it's not always guaranteed that it would go to the right area that you want when you click

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,480
on the check box,

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,640
so it's better to drag it and drop it to the area that you want and usually the fields that

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,190
you would put in the rose section would be feels that you want to group by so you can group

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,190
buy the product.

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,050
It could be also the reason it could be a certain business unit,

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,360
a certain manager sales person.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,860
So these air the fields that you'd usually put in the roast section.

29
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,130
Now,

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,300
on the columns area,

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,210
you usually put deals where you would want to show the trend of the data.

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,550
So usually you put the weeks,

33
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,450
the months,

34
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,010
the quarters or the years usually feels where you would want to show a trend.

35
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,400
So here on the column section,

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,860
I'm gonna put the years I'm going to drag and drop the year here on the column section.

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,250
Now,

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,120
on the values area here,

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,890
you would usually put feels that you would want to aggregate,

40
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,010
so you'd usually want to put the sum of sales the average price,

41
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,360
the maximum price.

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,750
So these air quantitative feels that you would want to aggregate So here,

43
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,830
I'm gonna put actually this sales amount.

44
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,030
I'm going to drag and drop the sales amount,

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,250
and you can see here it defaults to showing the some.

46
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,130
If you need to do a different type of aggregation,

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,760
you can click on this arrow here and go to value field settings and then choose a different

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,750
type of aggregation.

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,750
You can choose the Count average Max Hman product,

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,050
all these different types of aggregations.

51
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,570
But here,

52
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,760
I'm just going to stick with the some I'm gonna click.

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,250
OK,

54
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,460
Okay.

55
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,630
So let's take a step back here and analyze what we've got on our pivot table.

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,010
So in this cell here that I've got highlighted,

57
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:36,500
we've got the sales for product one in 2016 which is 1,095,430.

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:36,870
Now,

59
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,030
if you go back to our data and we filter our data for product one and for the year 2016 you

60
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,870
can see here these air older sales that happened for product one for 2016.

61
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,180
Now,

62
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,910
if we highlight the column here for the sales amount,

63
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,230
all the values for a calm for the sales amount and we check the summation here it's

64
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,690
1,095,430.

65
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,800
So basically,

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,360
the pivot table is summarizing our data here nicely,

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,780
and the same goes for product to in 2016.

68
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,380
So this cell re presents the sales for product to in 2016 and so on and so forth.

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,540
So,

70
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,390
as you can see here,

71
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,510
the pivot table is a nice way to summarize your data.

72
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,020
Now let's speak about our final area,

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,400
which is the filter.

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,420
So the filter's area is an optional area where you can put a field and usually you would

75
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,380
want to put fuels that you would want to filter with.

76
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,620
So,

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,290
for example,

78
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,760
the sales person or the region.

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,720
So here I'm gonna put the region,

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,450
for example,

81
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,050
I'm gonna put the sales person,

82
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,170
and this way you're able to filter the data on your pivot table with certain cart iria.

83
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,340
So,

84
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,990
for example,

85
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,460
I can filter only for the sales that happened in the Americas.

86
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,880
And you can see here the values have changed to show only the sales that happened for the

87
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,840
Americas and for the sales person,

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,370
I can also filter by a certain sales person.

89
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,540
As you can see here,

90
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,460
it shows me on Lee the sales amount for that particular sales person and also for the

91
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,910
Americans.

92
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,270
Because we've got an America's filter applied already as well.

93
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,650
Using a pivot table,

94
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,720
you're also able to swap your feels.

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,120
So,

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,480
actually,

97
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm gonna swap here the product,

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,200
name the location for the product name,

99
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,820
put it in the columns and then take the year and put it in the roads.

100
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,080
So it's actually a nice way to get your data in different forms here,

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,530
and you can also hear Remove the filter as you can see here,

102
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,810
by selecting all to this way you've removed you filter.

103
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,190
So,

104
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,510
as you can see are the pivot table is a nice way to put your data in any shape that you

105
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,860
want.
