00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180
Hey,

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,450
guys,

3
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,070
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,110
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,870
we're going to see how we can create a percentage running total using pivot table.

6
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,100
So as we've seen on the PDS video,

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,510
we managed to create a running total.

8
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,970
But that was a value.

9
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,790
Now we can create a percentage running total where actually our sales were accumulate as

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,670
percentages,

11
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,960
and the percentage will be the sales so far in the year divided by the total sales for that

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,990
particular year.

13
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,760
So let's have an example here.

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,190
We're gonna actually insert another instance of the sales amount here into the submission

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,480
of value section and there were going to click on it,

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,820
go to value field settings and then go to show values as.

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,680
And then instead of no calculation,

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,040
we're going to select percentage running total in and the base field is gonna be the sales

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,050
month because we want our sales percentage to accumulate across the months until it reaches

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,280
100% at the end of the year,

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,730
which is gonna be in December.

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,250
So you will see that the percentage running total in December is going to be 100% and then

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,040
we will give it a custom Names is going to be percentage running total dash months and then

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,730
we're gonna click.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,210
OK,

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,470
here.

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,800
So let's examine here.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,420
What happened?

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,140
Let's see here the totals or the sub totals for 2016.

30
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,380
So,

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,260
as you can see here,

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:26,070
the sales in January 2016 was 330,181 and this represents a 20160.63% of the sales in the

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,820
hole 2016.

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,650
This is the percentage of running tools so far now.

35
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,150
In February,

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,580
sales were 29,549 and then percentage running total is 9.4%.

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,730
So this 9.4% represents basically sales for January plus sales for February,

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,470
divided by total sales in 2000 and 16 in the whole 2060 on then.

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,230
As you can see here,

40
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:59,400
the percentage of running total is going to keep on accumulating until it reaches 100% in

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,760
December 2016.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09,410
Because basically the values are being accumulated month over month until December 2060 so

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:16,750
December 2016 represents ah 100% and you can also accumulate values across any other field

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,240
that you want by changing your base field.

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,840
And we've seen that on the previous video and this video.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,410
So that's it,

47
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:23,700
guys,

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,460
for the percentage running totals.

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,550
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
