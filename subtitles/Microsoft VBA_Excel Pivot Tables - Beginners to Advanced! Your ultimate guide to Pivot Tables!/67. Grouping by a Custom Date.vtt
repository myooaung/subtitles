00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
in this video,

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.260
we're going to see how to group our data around a custom date so we can group our data

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.960
based on a custom date.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.370
So here,

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.170
I've got my pivot table and I've got the order date here on the world section and the sum

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.590
of sales amount on the submission of value section.

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.850
And here is because here we've got data for 2016 and for 2070.

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.690
And let's say I want a group my data based on the 1st 6 months of 2017 so that I would make

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.630
that a group and then anything before that is another group and anything after that is

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.920
another group as well.

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.380
So to do that,

12
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.810
I can actually right click and then click on group here and I'll be starting on the first

13
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.000
of the 1st 2017 and ending on the 30th of June here,

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.980
2017 and then I'll select to group by months and then I'll click OK,

15
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.990
and let's see here what happens?

16
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.660
So I'm grouping by months.

17
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.270
Between two dates the first of January 2017 and the 30th of January 2017 on because I'm

18
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.130
grouping by months,

19
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.040
you can see her that Excel has group my data by months between the starting date and the

20
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.750
ending date.

21
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.130
So,

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.510
as you can see here and then I've got actually another cluster of data or a group of data,

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.860
which is anything before my starting date.

24
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.120
So anything before the 1st January 2070.

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.840
This is a group here,

26
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.270
and this is the submission of sales about for that period of time and then anything after

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.370
the 33 June 2017.

28
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.420
It says here greater than 33 June 2017.

29
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.140
Because here we've got the submission of the sales amount for that as well.

30
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.440
So,

31
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.960
as you can see,

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.850
I managed to group my data by months,

33
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.360
and I put a custom starting and ending date.

34
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.900
So that's resulted in having my grouping done by months because they selected months during

35
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.390
these two dates or between these two dates.

36
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.830
And then I've got another group where before thes two dates and then 1/3 group after these

37
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.560
two dates,

38
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.960
probably you wouldn't be using that a lot,

39
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.850
but it's just good to know that you could do it.

40
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.420
Okay,

41
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.540
So that's it,

42
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.890
guys.

43
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.580
For grouping by custom date.

44
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.630
Thank you very much.

45
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.150
You watching this video And I'll see on the next one.
