00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
Hey,

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:00,840
guys,

3
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,330
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,220
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,450
we're going to see how we can group by time.

6
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,480
Using pivot tables Says you can see here.

7
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,250
I've got a sales data set and a spurt of the daily said we get the transaction times which

8
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,870
time of the day the sails transaction happened.

9
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,790
And let's say that we want to create a pivot table in order to some our sales by our so

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,020
that we know which hour of the day we have the most sales on.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,960
So to do that,

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,470
I'm gonna insert a new pivot table.

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,850
Here's insert pivot table,

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,520
and I'm gonna insert it onto the pivot cheat here,

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,670
and I'm gonna click OK here to insert my pivot table.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,950
And now I'm gonna put the transaction time here on the road section,

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,160
and I'm gonna put my sales amount on the submission of Value Section.

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,930
As you can see air because I'm using Excel 3 65 XL actually has automatically grouped my

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,920
transaction time by hours and minutes.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,310
Usually,

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,920
this doesn't happen in earlier versions of Excel and to do the grouping.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,390
You right click here on the transaction Time column here and then click on group here.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,190
As you can see here,

24
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,320
Excel is currently grouping by hours and minutes and seconds.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,160
But I just need to group by hours because I wouldn't be grouping by minutes or seconds.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,190
That's too much granularity for me.

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,520
I just want a group by our and you could also tell Excel,

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,300
which starting our you need the grouping to start from and which ending our You need the

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,830
grouping to end at as well.

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,250
So if you click ok here.

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:25,960
As you can see here,

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,050
I managed to group by our So basically,

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,160
this is the submission of sales that happened on the first hour of the day,

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,660
which is 302,937.

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,360
Let's actually give some number formatting here to our data.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,390
So if I go to analyze and then select entire pivot table and then select the values on a

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,330
right click and click on form,

38
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,280
it sells here,

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,380
I can select the currency.

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,870
So say I'm going to select the US dollars and I'm gonna click.

41
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,320
OK,

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,710
here.

43
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,170
As you can see here we have a currency.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,090
So basically,

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,410
on the first hour of the day,

46
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,040
we have 302,937 2nd hour of the day,

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
256,853.

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,590
So,

49
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,370
as it is here,

50
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,620
we can know which our the day we had the most sales on.

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,140
So if he actually go to the data top here,

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,230
and then we could assert our data by the highest our.

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,890
So basically,

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,460
around 1 p.m. we had the most sales.

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,900
Now,

56
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,170
sometimes you would see the hours in a MPM format instead of a 24 hour format,

57
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,600
and this actually depends on the date and time settings on your computer.

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,080
So if you right click here on the clock at the bottom right corner of your screen,

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
I'm using Windows 10 and clean click on a just date and time to go to your date and time

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,610
settings.

61
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,650
You click on change date and time format and then,

62
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,170
actually it depends on the short time format here,

63
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,430
and it's a big glitchy,

64
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,480
actually doesn't work well all the time,

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,610
so usually this should yield an E M P M format,

66
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,060
but actually,

67
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,580
the format I have here is a 24 hour format here on the pivot table.

68
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,670
It's a bit glitchy,

69
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,240
and it doesn't always follow it correctly,

70
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,160
but the format of the hours on the pivot table should actually usually follow your date and

71
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,530
time format settings.

72
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,440
But it's a bit glitchy is it doesn't always work well,

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,450
so for the 24 hour format,

74
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,640
you should actually have this selection here,

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,500
although I'm having this election,

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,890
which should yield in a MPM format.

77
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,650
But anyways,

78
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,920
if you need to change the format between 24 hour and AM PM is actually through your date on

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,310
time settings on your operating system here on Windows.

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:31,740
Okay,

81
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,380
so that's it,

82
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:32,740
guys,

83
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,410
for grouping by time.

84
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,720
Thank you so much for watching this video I'll see on the next one.
