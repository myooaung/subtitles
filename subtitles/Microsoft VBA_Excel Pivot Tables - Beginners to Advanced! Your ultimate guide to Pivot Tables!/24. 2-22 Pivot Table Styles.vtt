00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
and this video,

2
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.710
we're going to speak about changing styles for your pivot tables,

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.960
so they change the pivot table style.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.480
You can select any cell in your pivot table and then go to design tab on the ribbon,

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.930
and then you can see here.

6
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.230
We've got a pivot table styles option here,

7
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.040
and you can select from different styles for your pivot,

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.220
table says.

9
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.800
You can see here we've got tons of styles that you can select from.

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.050
So select this style,

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.710
for example.

12
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.290
And as you can see,

13
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.690
your each style has an array off colors and styles that you can apply to your pivot table.

14
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.670
There are other options here as well under the design top.

15
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.280
So there is the pivot table style options area where you could earn choose to have the road

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.320
headers here,

17
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.900
having to fill color or not,

18
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.070
and the column headers to and you could choose toe have banded Rose or Bandit columns,

19
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.840
Michigan's years.

20
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.150
You can play with the pivot table styles and select the one that best suits your taste.

21
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.020
There is another option here that I want to demonstrate,

22
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.830
but first of all,

23
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.090
I'll just apply a different fund style to my row Headers year.

24
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.450
So apply a night Alec,

25
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.930
for example,

26
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.130
for the products.

27
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.050
As you can see here,

28
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.980
they have all become italics.

29
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.430
And then,

30
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.970
if you go again to design tab on the ribbon,

31
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.300
there's an option here.

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.570
If you right click on any of the styles,

33
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.250
there's an auction.

34
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.310
This is applying clear formatting and apply and maintain formatting,

35
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.610
and this will basically either clear or maintain the formatting that you have on you pivot

36
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.270
table when applying the style.

37
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450
So applying clear formatting well,

38
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.700
actually apply the style and clear the ICT Alec Fund that we had Cizikas here.

39
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.660
Now the product labels are not italics anymore.

40
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.050
The products air no italics.

41
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.970
And if you press control and see on a keyboard and then try the other option,

42
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.710
apply and maintained formatting,

43
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.680
you can see here that while the style has been applied,

44
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.050
the formatting as well has been maintained.

45
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.730
So as you consider,

46
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.740
the products are still italics here,

47
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.620
there is another option as well,

48
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.690
which is that you can set a certain style to be the default style in this workbook,

49
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.560
so that whenever you create a pivot table,

50
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.630
you'll be created with that particular style.

51
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.430
So if you right click on any style and then set as default Now when you insert a pivot

52
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.900
table.

53
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.130
So if he insert a pivot table and let's say we're gonna base it on our data here you click

54
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.130
.

55
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.720
OK,

56
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.290
you can see here that the style is now that style that we set as default,

57
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.910
which is the yellow style here.

58
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.320
Okay,

59
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.480
so you can set a default style in your workbook so that you can use it all the time when

60
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.730
creating a pivot table.

61
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.990
OK,

62
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.720
so that's it for pivot table styles.

63
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.900
Thanks very much watching.

64
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.020
We'll see on the next one.
