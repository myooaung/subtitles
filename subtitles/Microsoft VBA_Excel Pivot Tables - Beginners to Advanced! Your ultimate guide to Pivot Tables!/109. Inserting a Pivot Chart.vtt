00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Now we're going to speak about pivot chores.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.170
So pivot charts enable us to see our data visually,

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.470
locate trends and sold problems.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.820
So Excel has an option to insert a pivot chart,

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.140
which is basically on extension of your pivot table.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.890
So as you're making changes to your pivot table,

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.460
your pivot chart also changes.

8
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.280
So to insert a pivot chart,

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.220
we just need to click anywhere inside our pivot table and then either go to a pivot table

10
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.730
in Ali,

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.960
stabbed here and then click on Pivot Short.

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.490
So that's one way to do it.

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.750
Another way is to go to the insert tab here,

14
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.250
and then we can insert the type of chart that we want.

15
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.790
We could also go to the recommended chart and see what charts are recommended for us and

16
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.700
check the different types of charts here.

17
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.450
And we could also hear Go to pivot chart as well.

18
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.430
Okay,

19
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.810
so these air multiple ways to insert a pivot chart,

20
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.250
so I'll go to recommend the charts here and then here.

21
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.190
I'm just going to select the Clustered column.

22
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.670
This is the first recommendation.

23
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.990
It's just a normal column chart and press okay here and Now I've inserted a pivot chart.

24
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.450
Now,

25
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.000
on this pivot table,

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.550
you can see here that we've got the reasons on the role able section here.

27
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.280
The reasons and then we've got the year as well on the column label section.

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.000
And if you check here the names of the different areas year when you click on the pivot

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.470
table,

30
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.650
the names are rows,

31
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.400
columns and submission of values and filters.

32
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.140
But when you click on the pivot chart itself,

33
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.660
the names change a bit here,

34
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.470
so filters remain as it is in submission of values.

35
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.910
But here the Role Able section is now the access categories,

36
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.020
and the column label section is now the legend or the Siri's.

37
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.910
Okay,

38
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.260
so you can see here that the names changed a bit here on the role local section and the

39
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.250
column label section,

40
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.620
and you can see here that the field on the role labels is actually on the X axis so you can

41
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.960
see the regions are on the X axis and the fields on the field.

42
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.610
On the column labels you can see here.

43
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550
It's actually on the Y axis,

44
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.450
and the values as well off course are plotted on the Y axis on Because this is a pivot

45
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.880
chart,

46
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.960
you can definitely switch over here the fields on the X axis and the Y axis So you could

47
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.660
get the year here and you could get the region here.

48
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.780
And you have a different chart now,

49
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.310
where you have the years on the X axis and you have the reasons here on the Y axis,

50
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.360
you can see here.

51
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.510
We've got a legend of the elements here on the Y axis.

52
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.210
Here,

53
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.860
we've got a legend that shows us the different regions.

54
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.470
And before,

55
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.920
of course,

56
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.870
this legend showed us the different years when we had the years on the Y axis and the

57
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.310
reasons on the X axis you can see her as well.

58
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.500
We've got some buttons,

59
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.950
and these buttons allow us to filter the chart so we can filter the chart for only the data

60
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.050
for 2016 for example,

61
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.450
and or weaken totally for 2016 in 2017.

62
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.770
As you can see here,

63
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.560
we could also certain filter for certain regions only the Americas,

64
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.170
for example.

65
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.960
On we see only the Americas and these filters are connected to the pivot table.

66
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.620
So as you can see here,

67
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.370
the filter Israel flight on the pivot chart have been applied on the pivot table,

68
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.330
and also that goes vice versa.

69
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.350
So we can select to have over years here on the pivot table,

70
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.750
and that will be reflected on our pivot short as well.

71
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.900
We could select more than the Americas.

72
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.850
So Americans in Australia and we will have that reflected on our pivot short as well.

73
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.000
We could also insert a slicer So even if we insert a slicer so if we answer the slicer,

74
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.500
the slicer will also affect our pivot charts.

75
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.600
I can slice,

76
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.220
for example,

77
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.480
with the region's Aiken.

78
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.750
So look the regions here to be the field under my slicer.

79
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.000
And I can just select a single region here and you can see her.

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.550
My slicer effects both my pivot table and my pivot short as well.

81
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.190
So slicers,

82
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.160
pivot tables and pivot charts are connected to each other as long as they have the scene

83
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.530
data sorts off course.

84
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.610
And as long as it is,

85
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.990
you make sure that the slicer is connected to the pivot table as well.

86
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.550
Ok,

87
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.820
guys.

88
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.030
So in this video we managed to explain how to insert a pivot chart and also how to insert a

89
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.200
slicer and control your pivot charts and pivot tables with slicers.

90
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.650
Okay,

91
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.880
guys.

92
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.220
So that's it for this lesson.

93
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.000
Thank you very much.

94
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.050
Watching this video I'll see on the next one.
