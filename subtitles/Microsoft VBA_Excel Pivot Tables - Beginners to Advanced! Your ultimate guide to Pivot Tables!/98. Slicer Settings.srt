00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
in this video,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:08,330
we're going to speak about the different settings that weaken adjust on our Sisler's so

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,400
first of old to view this settings for slicers.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,110
You could just select any slicer here and then go to the slicer tab here on the ribbon,

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,310
and it could be also named options on older Excel versions and then click on slicer

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,140
settings as an alternative.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,780
You could also right click on the slicer here and then click on slicer settings.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,520
And here you've got some settings that you can adjust for your slicer.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,150
So the first setting here is the slicer name,

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,950
so we can change the name of the slicer as an object.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,610
So here the name of the slicer,

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,110
its product name,

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,510
I could change it to just product and then click.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,250
OK,

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,460
and then I can see the name of the slicer here on the upper left corner of the screen.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,750
When you select the slicer,

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,180
you will see the name of the slicer here in the name box.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,570
So,

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,350
as you can see here,

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,250
we managed to change the name of the slicer from product name to product.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,060
Now the name of the slicer is actually different from the slicer title,

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,990
so the title here is product name.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,280
We could also change that.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,400
Now let's right.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,220
Click on the slicer and then go to slicer settings.

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,440
And then here is the header of the slicer.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,140
So you could first of all,

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,540
choose to either display the head or hide it.

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,750
So if I uncheck this and click OK,

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:37,010
the header gets hidden or you could also display the header and change its names a year.

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,950
I can change the name of the header of the slicer toe product.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,040
So if I click OK here,

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,350
you can see here that now the head of the Sizer,

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,410
it says product instead of product name.

35
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,620
Another option that you can change on your slices is the sorting on your slicer items.

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,080
So I'm going to right click on my reason slicer here and then go to slicer settings.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,270
And as you can see here,

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,310
I've got some sorting and filtering options.

39
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,620
So I consort the slicer items to these regions here eight Z or Z to a on.

40
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,080
It could also use custom,

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,150
this one Sertic.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,700
So we've explained custom lists on a previous video,

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,490
but it's basically a way of doing a customize sorting for your slicer items.

44
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,270
So,

45
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,840
for example,

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,120
if I need to do a custom,

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,910
I sorting for my reasons here so that I would have America's and in Europe and then

48
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,560
Australia.

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,440
So that's a customer asserting That's not an eight easy and not a Z to A.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,300
I will need to use this option,

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,050
but I will also need to create a custom list.

52
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,920
So to do that too great a custom list.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,500
I'll click OK here for now,

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,760
and then I'll go to file and then goto options and then go to advanced.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,820
And then if I scroll down here under general,

56
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,650
I will have it.

57
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,880
It custom this.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,320
So if I click on that,

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,910
I can create a custom list here for sorting so I can create a list that is America's and

60
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,000
then Europe and then Australia.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,150
And then I'll click on add and then I'll click on OK,

62
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,450
here and click OK again,

63
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,050
and now I can apply my custom list.

64
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,910
So if I right click here on the slicer,

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,170
go to slicer settings and make sure that this option is sticked here,

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,120
use custom lists.

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Consorting,

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,630
click OK,

69
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,030
and I need to make sure as well to refresh my pivot tables or right click and then refresh

70
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,030
.

71
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,090
You can see here that might custom list Sorting has been applied.

72
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,350
So now I have my reasons sorted as America's Europe and then Australia,

73
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:50,080
which is not an agency and not a Z to a let's speak about more options that we have on our

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,120
slicer settings.

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,300
So if I right click here on my customer slicer and then go to slicer settings,

76
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,930
you can see here that I've got some options on the right hindsight here.

77
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,890
So the first option is to hide items with no data.

78
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,300
So if I have any of my customers here that doesn't have data on my source data set,

79
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,840
then this customer would be hidden.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,810
If I check this check box on,

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,850
then there is visually indicate items with no data.

82
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,650
So if I have on item with no data,

83
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,280
one of my customers that doesn't have data,

84
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,050
it would be visually indicated so that it would actually have a bit of a lighter shade of

85
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,050
yellow here on the slicer.

86
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,170
And then you could also show items with no data last so that this customer here,

87
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:42,460
if it doesn't have data on my source data set will be shown last at the bottom and show

88
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,410
items deleted from the data source.

89
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,970
So if it is deleted from the data source,

90
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,450
it would still show it on the list here if this check box is checked.

91
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,230
So that's actually have an example.

92
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,160
So click okay,

93
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,300
here and now I'll actually go to my source data set and I'll delete one of my customers

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,870
entirely.

95
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,100
So,

96
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,850
for example,

97
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,350
I'll delete to life here.

98
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:12,670
I'll just delete the data for this customer from my source data set.

99
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,180
And then oh,

100
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,850
I'm filter here and then go to pivot and then I'll refresh my pivot table.

101
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,980
And as you can see here,

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,840
I've deleted to life and is taken seriously moved to the bottom.

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,380
And it's been indicated visually that this item doesn't have data on the dais.

104
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,200
It it has a bit of a lighter yellow or more transparent yellow color here,

105
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,510
as you can see now,

106
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,070
if we right,

107
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,650
click here on the slicer settings and then check this height items with no data check box

108
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,410
and click OK,

109
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:44,740
here.

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,630
You can see here that true life now does not exist on my slicer because there's no data for

111
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:50,950
it.

112
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,990
However,

113
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,140
if you go to our pivot table and click on this filter button here,

114
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,840
you can see that it's still on my list here,

115
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,790
off the data or of the customers that I can filter for true life is still there.

116
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,650
So to remove it from that list,

117
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,600
a swell I can right click here and then go to pivot table options and then go to data and

118
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,350
then here,

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,760
under retained items deleted from the data source number of items to retain per field.

120
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:27,040
I can select non and click OK here and then I will need to right click and refresh my pivot

121
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,570
table and then check here and music is here.

122
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,150
It has gone,

123
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,030
and this option that we changed on the pivot table options it.

124
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,140
I will also affects the slicers.

125
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,950
So if you change it before you delete the item on your data and then refresh you pivot

126
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,310
table,

127
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,150
it will also be removed from your slicers.

128
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,580
So that's eight guys today for the slicer settings.

129
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,550
Thanks so much watching this video,

130
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,950
and I'll see on the next one
