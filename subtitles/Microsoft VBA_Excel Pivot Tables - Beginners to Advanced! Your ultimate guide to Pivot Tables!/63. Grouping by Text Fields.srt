00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
Hey,

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:00,760
guys,

3
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,520
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,510
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,090
we're going to see how weaken Group by texts fields and let me show you an example here.

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,460
So we've got a private table here,

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,430
and I'm gonna put our regions here on the road section and you can see here we've got our

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,440
regions Africa,

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,080
Americas,

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,150
Australia and Europe.

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,000
And let's say I want to divide these regions into Central and East and West,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,750
for example.

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,410
So for me,

14
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,850
because I live in Canada,

15
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,510
so my East is gonna be Africa and Europe.

16
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,700
So I'm gonna click on Africa and then hold the control button and click on Europe.

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,240
And then I'm going to right click here,

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,230
go to group.

19
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,010
And as you can see here now,

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,740
Africa and Europe have been put into Group one.

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,310
I can actually rename the group into east,

22
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,660
and then you can see here America's is put into a group called America's.

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,630
I can rename that into Central,

24
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:59,530
and then I'm gonna rename Australia into West since Australia is on my west as a live in

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,080
Canada.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,270
So as you can see here,

27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,080
I've been able to divide my reasons year into three categories.

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,810
East Central and West,

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,400
and a Zika is here.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,830
There's another field that has been created on the row section here called Region to,

31
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:22,500
and we can use that field actually to use our new Divisions Year East Center on West so I

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,010
can first start by renaming that other field called Region to.

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,970
So I'm going to click on it,

34
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,330
go to field settings here,

35
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,980
and I can just rename it to my reasons,

36
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,610
for example,

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,190
and I'm going to click OK,

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,550
here.

39
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,590
So now I have the My Regions field and I can move it actually to the column section if I

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,110
want to,

41
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,280
and I can drag now.

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,080
My sales amount here into the value section and,

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,830
as you can see her,

44
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,370
have been able to slice and dice my data with my new reasons.

45
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,180
As you can see,

46
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,660
her Africa and Europe half Onley values in east because they are in the East region and

47
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,600
America's has only values in Central because it's on the central region on Australia has

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,230
only values in the West because it's on the West reason.

49
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,060
So that's it,

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,590
guys for grouping by text fields,

51
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,500
so you're able to create your additional custom groups here in pivot tables.

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,340
One more thing,

53
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,760
actually,

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,750
is that the new field that we've created,

55
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,460
which is Mother My reasons field is not part off.

56
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,940
My original data is just in the pivot cash.

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,660
So we don't have a column here called my region or a column for our new regions or new

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,310
divisions.

59
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,750
It's only stored in memory.

60
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,250
So it's like a virtual column,

61
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,040
basically.

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,190
So thanks,

63
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,410
guys,

64
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,250
for watching I'll see on the next one.
