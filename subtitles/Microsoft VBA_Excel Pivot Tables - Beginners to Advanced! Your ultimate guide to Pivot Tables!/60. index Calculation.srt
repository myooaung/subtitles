1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
Hey,

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,260
guys,

3
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,010
welcome back.

4
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,300
So in this video,

5
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,580
we're going to explain the index calculation in pivot tables.

6
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,050
So the index calculation shows the relative weight of each cell when compared to its row

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,320
Total column total and grand total.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,140
So it's taken example here.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,630
Let's say that we have some money that we can invest in extra marketing for one of our

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,050
products in a particular region,

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,470
and you want to decide which product in which region should be invest in its marketing?

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:40,110
Should we invest in its marketing so that we get the most bang for buck for what we invest

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,620
in marketing?

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,350
The index calculation can help make the right decision.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,690
So,

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,540
as you can see here,

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,420
we have a pivot table that shows us the sales for each of our products in the different

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,090
regions.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,690
Now,

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,880
an initial intuition would suggest that we check which product has the high sales in which

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,410
region.

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,910
So someone could just highlight all the sales,

23
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,530
were over the products and create a heat map here,

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,520
going to conditional formatting color scales and create a heat map and the highest values,

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,460
the greenest and the highest in sales.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,950
This product to in Europe.

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,350
So that's what we should invest in.

28
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,910
We should invest in extra marketing for product to in your Well,

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,520
let's see what the index calculation has to say.

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,420
I'm going to copy my pivot table here and paste it below,

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,180
and I'm gonna change the calculation on my pivot table.

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,760
I'm going to click on the submission of sales here,

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,780
go to value fees,

34
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,500
settings,

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,770
go to show values as and for the calculation.

36
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,890
I'm going to change it to index.

37
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,320
And I'm gonna change the name here to index and I'm gonna click,

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,960
OK,

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,140
And let's check our values year.

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,990
Our values should be around one,

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,370
and they shouldn't have a currency format.

42
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,380
They should have a number for months.

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,050
I'm just going to change the format here to a number with two decimal places.

44
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,340
So,

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,360
as you can see here,

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,660
the greenest value,

47
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,450
the highest value,

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,920
is actually for product three in the Americas.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,950
So that's what the index calculation is suggesting.

50
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,550
It is suggesting that we invest in product three in the Americas that we do extra marketing

51
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,920
for product three in the Americas so sickens here.

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,530
The index for product three is 2.12 and the index calculation would deal.

53
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,900
The number that is around the one it could be less than a one could be more than one or

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,680
could be a one,

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,100
depending on the value and the higher the value.

56
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,910
Basically,

57
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,710
the more weight this value has in the array of values that we have in the pivot tables on

58
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,090
the higher the value,

59
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,680
the more weight this value has in our pivot table.

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,320
Now let's actually see what the formula for the index is.

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,600
So the formula for the index is actually the value in the cell multiplied by the grand

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,170
total,

63
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,580
divided by the row total multiplied by the column.

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:02,780
Tal.

65
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,230
So,

66
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,020
for example,

67
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,670
here for product three in the Americas,

68
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,970
it's 2.12.

69
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,840
That's because the calculation here is value in the cell.

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:20,580
So product in America's This is the value in the cell 1,165,659 and then multiplied up by

71
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,750
the grand total.

72
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,030
What's the Grendel?

73
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,440
It's this value here,

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,500
6,589,000 and 66.

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,280
So this is the grand tool,

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,980
and what's the row total for product three in the Americas.

77
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,490
The total for the whole row is 1,474,967.

78
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,550
That's the road oval,

79
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,690
and what's the column totaled?

80
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,520
Column total here is two million,

81
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,380
452,000 and 43.

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,830
So that's the column total here for the comb containing product three in the Americas.

83
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,810
As you can see here,

84
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,790
the index is 2.12.

85
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,390
So this is the calculation for the index.

86
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,490
The calculation for the index usually yields a number that is either greater than one or

87
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,410
less than one.

88
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,090
And the higher the number,

89
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:18,190
the more weight this value has in the pivot table with respect to the other values or

90
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,390
compared to the other values.

91
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,340
And as we saw in the formula,

92
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,620
setting the value in the cell aside,

93
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,250
the index would depend on the grand total row total and column total for that particular

94
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,850
value.

95
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,490
Also,

96
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,640
if you think about it,

97
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,720
the sales for product three in the Americas So this value is actually 48% out off the

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,540
column total,

99
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,560
So it's 48% out of the sails for product.

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,640
Three in all,

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,480
the other regions.

102
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,460
So about half of the sales that we do for product three worldwide is done in the Americas

103
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,190
or happens in the Americas.

104
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,950
So it's a considerable amount.

105
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,660
Also,

106
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:08,610
this sales for product three in the Americas represents about 79% off this sales for all

107
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,770
the products in the Americas,

108
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:18,920
and the sales for product three in the Americas represents about 18% off all of our sales

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,940
worldwide,

110
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,190
says also in considerable amount.

111
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,730
So as we demonstrated here,

112
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,480
the index calculation can help us in decision making.

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,180
So that's it,

114
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,490
guys,

115
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,160
for the index calculation,

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,440
I hope you found this video useful.

117
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,780
Thank you for watching,

118
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,350
and I'll see on the next one.
