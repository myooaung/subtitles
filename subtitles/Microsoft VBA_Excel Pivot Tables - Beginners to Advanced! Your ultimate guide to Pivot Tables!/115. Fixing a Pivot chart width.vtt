00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Okay,

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.740
So let me show you a neat trick here when it comes to the positioning and the width of

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.470
pivot shorts.

4
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.000
So,

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.450
as you can see here on this pivot chart,

6
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.560
if I try to insert a new column here in the scene area that the pivot chart is in.

7
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.000
So if I inserted you call him.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600
Because here the pivot short expanded,

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.330
and it also moved a little bit.

10
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.700
I'll do that again here,

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.030
and it is.

12
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.560
It is here.

13
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.340
It expanded,

14
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.650
and it moved a little bit.

15
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.750
So if you need to prevent that,

16
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.320
if you need to prevent you pivot chart from moving and expanding or so if you need to

17
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.490
prevent that if you need you to prevent you pivot chart from moving or expanding when you

18
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.840
insert a new column or when you have just the width of your column here you can click on

19
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.260
the pivot chart itself,

20
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.190
and then you can just press control and one on your keyboard here to go to the options,

21
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.580
and then you can go here to the properties.

22
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.600
So under the size and properties,

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.660
you can go to properties and then you can see where there is an option to move in size with

24
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.030
cells,

25
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.050
which is what it currently is on.

26
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.660
And then there is an option here to move but do not size with cells.

27
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.650
So this way,

28
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.970
when we insert a new column,

29
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.580
it's gonna move a little bit.

30
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.030
But it's not gonna resize.

31
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.450
It's not gonna get expanded or shrunk when we insert a new column.

32
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.620
So this is that option.

33
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.380
And then there is the other option here,

34
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.190
which is Do not move or size with cells.

35
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.920
So this way he will not move or get resized when we insert in you column or when we adjust

36
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560
the with off the colors.

37
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.830
So this is a little neat trick here if you need to prevent your pivot chart for a moving or

38
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.160
being expanded when you insert a new column or just the with of an existing column
