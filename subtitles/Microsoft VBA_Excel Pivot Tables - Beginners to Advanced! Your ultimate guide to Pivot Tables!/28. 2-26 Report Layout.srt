1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
and this video,

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,930
we're going to speak about the different report layouts for a pivot table.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,300
So excel pivot tables have different layouts that you can choose from,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,800
and in this video we're going to speak about the different layouts.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,980
So in order to change the layouts for you,

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,650
pivot table,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,990
you need to select a cell inside your pivot table and then go to the design tab on the

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,810
ribbon and then under the layout group here,

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,860
you've got the report layout option,

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,860
and currently we are in the compact form,

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,330
the compact form lee out.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,980
So this is the default lee out that you get when you create a pivot table.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,360
So this is the compact form.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,590
And as you can see here,

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,110
we've got two fields in the rose section,

16
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,880
the product name and the sales person.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,230
And,

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,040
as you can see here,

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,260
both feels are in the same column as you can see here.

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,750
So got each product,

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,610
and then we've got each sales person.

22
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,640
They are old on the same column and at the top here with just got a generic label.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,450
It doesn't say product name or sales person.

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,900
It just says grow labels Now let's try the other layup that we have here,

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,060
which is the outline form and,

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,200
as you can see here when we select the outlying form,

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,420
because here that each field on the Rose section now has been moved to its own column here

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,420
.

29
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,510
So you got the product name in the first column and then the sales person in the second

30
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,890
column.

31
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,490
You can see here as well that the labels or the headings for each product here.

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,300
So for product one product to and product three,

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,770
you can see here that it's in.

34
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,150
It's own separate TRO above any sales person.

35
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,750
So,

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,550
as you can see here,

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,290
this is the first sales person.

38
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:48,190
But you can see here that the product being above it in the Rose section each product is in

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,730
its own row.

40
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,130
Because here that we have our sub totals at the top,

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,890
however,

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,280
we can always have them at the bottom,

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,090
just like we showed on a previous video and injections year.

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,630
Now we have an extra row inserted for subtitles,

45
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,360
and they are at the bottom off the group.

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,920
When using this outline form were able to also repeat the item labels so we can actually

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,240
make product one appear in each row here.

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,070
And to do that we can go to the airport layout and then we have an option that says,

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,530
repeat all item labels and you will see here that now the row headings are gonna be

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,830
inserted in each row,

51
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,130
so this is actually useful.

52
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,840
If you're trying to do a look up And if you're trying to get your data in a tabular form or

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,650
if you're trying to print your data in tabular form,

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,860
this would be useful.

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,820
I'll press control and zeal my keyboard to undo that and remove the repeating off item

56
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,370
labels.

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,690
And now the third report layout that we have here is the tabular form.

58
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,260
So if we select that,

59
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,770
you can see here that now the labels of the first row field are not on their separate TRO

60
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,420
anymore.

61
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,640
Aziz,

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,780
you can see here now it's product one,

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,690
and then we have the sales person,

64
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,060
the first sales person starting on the same row.

65
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,370
Where is on the outline form?

66
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,780
You can see here that this first sales person starts on the following Rome not the same bro

67
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:16,780
.

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,020
So this is the tabular form for you.

69
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,050
You're also able to repeat old item labels on that form.

70
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,570
And,

71
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,870
as you can see here that Sepp totals on the tabular form appear at the bottom.

72
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,960
But they cannot appear at the top anymore because we don't have space for them.

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,990
Because now the item labels for the salesperson start on the same row as the item labels

74
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,920
for products.

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,860
So as you can see her if I go to sub totals and I tried to show the subtitles at the top,

76
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,050
I can't do that on the tabular form.

77
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,040
I can either just remove the sub totals or have them appear at the bottom.

78
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,080
I want to point out as well that if we go to the compact form were not able to repeat item

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,980
labels because basically,

80
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,530
there is no space for the item.

81
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,120
Lee was to be repeated because all the item labels here are owned the same column.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,450
So the product name and the sales person they're both on the same calm.

83
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,820
There's no space to repeat the item labels.

84
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,790
They're already there.

85
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,100
Okay,

86
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,330
so these were the three different layouts for pivot tables that you can choose from by

87
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,090
default.

88
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,110
You do get the compact form at the beginning,

89
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,300
and then you can choose which ever form that you want.

90
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,930
But when you create a pivot table,

91
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,030
it's always gonna be created in the compact form.

92
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,320
So thanks guys watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
