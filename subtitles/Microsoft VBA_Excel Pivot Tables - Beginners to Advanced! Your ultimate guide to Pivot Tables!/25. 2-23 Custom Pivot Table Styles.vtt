00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.270
and this video,

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.210
we're going to speak about creating custom pivot table styles.

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.310
So in Excel you can create a customized pivot table style.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.290
Or you can even duplicate a built in style from the styles that we've seen on the previous

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.410
video and make some adjustments of your own and make it your customized style.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.370
So to do this,

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.710
you can select any cell inside your pivot table and then go to the design tab here on the

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.150
ribbon.

9
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.300
And then you can either create a new pivot table style from scratch.

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.500
But I think that that will be a long process for you so you can click here and create a new

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.860
pivot,

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.670
stable style.

13
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.910
Another option is that you can duplicate an existing style,

14
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.690
which is what most people would do so you'd right click and then duplicate here.

15
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.310
And then this way you have another style,

16
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.670
and then you can name it custom style green,

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.400
for example.

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.380
This is a green style overall,

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.880
and then you might just do a few adjustments so you can do adjustments to any of the

20
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.510
elements here.

21
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.530
Feel free to explore them so you click on the element and then click on format and then you

22
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.870
can do Adjust Mr the Color.

23
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.470
So say I'm just gonna change the shade of green for the hetero to another shade click.

24
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.920
OK,

25
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.150
just a minor change and there is an option here,

26
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.220
a check box to set this as the full pivot table style for this document.

27
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.760
That is,

28
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.860
whenever you insert a pivot table will be inserted with this style.

29
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.530
But I'm not going to use that and you can press okay here and this way you will have your

30
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.850
own custom style.

31
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.100
Here,

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.000
this is we've got our system style.

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
You click on it while selecting your pivot table,

34
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.360
you pivot table will be styled using that style.

35
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.830
Now,

36
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.120
a question that might pop up in the students had when seeing this video is how can I make a

37
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.420
custom style available for any workbook while unfortunately,

38
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.320
there is no built in way in excel to do that.

39
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.940
However,

40
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.950
there are work arounds for it.

41
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.030
So axity there to workarounds because there is a work around for 2013 in 2010 and there is

42
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.010
another work around a different one for 2016.

43
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.590
So actually,

44
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.430
the worker runs for 2010 and 2013 will not work in 2016.

45
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.270
So first of all,

46
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.740
the work around for 2000 and 10 and 13 would be to actually select your pivot table.

47
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.730
Go to the analyze tab on the ribbon,

48
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.580
select the whole pivot table here,

49
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.720
entire pivot table and then control,

50
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.820
See to copy.

51
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.170
And then go to your,

52
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.760
for example,

53
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.810
new sheet or new workbook that you need to copy the pivot table style too,

54
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.550
and paste your pivot table.

55
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.130
Obviously,

56
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.520
this is not gonna work here because this is Excel 2016.

57
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.770
But this is how you do it in Excel 2010 or 2000 and 13.

58
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.260
So actually select my favorite table and deleted here,

59
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.470
and this is not gonna work.

60
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.970
So I'll go back to my original workbook here and in order to move your style from one

61
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.150
workbook to another in Excel 2016 what you need to do is to copy your sheet from your

62
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.520
current workbook to the other workbook in Excel 2016 and you need to copy using a certain

63
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.050
technique.

64
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.830
So actually you need to have your old workbook hanging over the new workbook this way.

65
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.780
So I've got my old workbook here,

66
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.440
or the original work for custom pivot table styles over the new workbook,

67
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440
which is called New Sheet.

68
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.460
And then you can press the control button press and hold a control button on your keyboard

69
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.220
and then make a copy of your worksheet to the new one like this.

70
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.200
And now the new works.

71
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.320
It has been copied,

72
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.790
and now your style has been imported.

73
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.630
So if you go to the design tab on the ribbon here,

74
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.550
you'll find your new style here.

75
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.460
Even if you delete the pivot table,

76
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.620
even if you select it and then delete it and that insert another pivot table,

77
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.050
insert a pivot table to a new worksheet.

78
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.380
Here you go to the design top on the ribbon.

79
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.370
You will have your stylus well still available.

80
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.940
Okay,

81
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.790
so that's how you can move your style from one workbook to another in Excel 2016.

82
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.710
Unfortunately,

83
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.060
there's no built in way to do it so far,

84
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.310
so thanks for watching.

85
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.410
I'll see on the next one
