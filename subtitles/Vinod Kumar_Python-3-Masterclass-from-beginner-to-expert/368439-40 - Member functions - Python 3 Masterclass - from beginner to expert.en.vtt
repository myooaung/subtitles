X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
since the class person is growing.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.610
Now let's try on these examples using some pie transcripts.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:13.060
So first I will create a new file call E X 22 Talk Freeway on Let's create the person,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.470
plus intact this,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.590
I'll say class person colon.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.300
And now I can take your death double underscored in it double in the store and take

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.790
yourself as the first perimeter.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.830
And then you can supply additional parameters if you want.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.080
We can also define the special perimeters here,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.870
like Star Arts are double star kw arcs and use the same thing.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.760
For example,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.630
I can use your double store kw aren't and then I can assign toe self taught double

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.310
underscore name equals toe kw art don't get and then say here name.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.260
So if name is an attribute off this keyword argument,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.710
pass it onto this In case if it was not defined,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.250
then it is automatically going to be none.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.250
So I can copy this and paste it and make the change your for this sentence City a copy

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.170
Paste this and then I'm rich in the city Toe email Treat parameters for this So now the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.150
user may supply zero are more named the perimeters.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.050
So not the RV Japan emitters,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.390
but the name the parameters.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.520
For example,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.410
let's write a function called me where I want to create a person object.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.270
I can tell you're P one equals toe person,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.790
and then I can say name equals toe.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.250
You know,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.800
email equals two,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.560
for example.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.730
We know that we know that.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.260
Go on.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.980
If I don't supply city,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.110
then that's going to be none.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.000
However,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690
I can also supply any other parameters,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.280
but I'm not using them inside this,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.590
so there will be a vest off parameters.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.060
For example,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.250
if a type your country calls to India,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.840
the country is there in the cave your art,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.800
but it is never stored in self,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.130
so we will not be doing that.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.680
But let's keep this as it is,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.460
and I want to print the leaders off people.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.550
Let's hear another function here death and then say print underscore details.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.360
If I don't receive any perimeter,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.630
it is okay while defining,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.280
but it will not be possible for us toe print the details for the time being.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.290
Let's just say he approved route.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.950
Underscore details hard If I take your P one dot trend Underscored details.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.190
Andi If I tried to call the main function now by typing gift under name equals toe Dunder

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.880
me,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.340
let's call the main method.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.370
If I now run this a script.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.530
The script execution as usual begins at this line on the main function is called here in

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.290
the main function.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.960
We're calling the class US A function,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.440
so basically we're constructing an object name and email go as part of the key word

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.120
argument.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.530
Now,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.930
Self was automatically supplied by tongue,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.720
which is the reference to the newly constructed object on in the newly constructed object.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.910
We are creating three private like member variables using the double underscore prefix

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.140
redeeming the values from the capably arched perimeter.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.070
And in case it is not fun,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.980
it's going to be assigned with none and come sort on the reference off.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.430
The newly constructed object is assigned to P one.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.460
How they printed what it's p one.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.500
It would simply safety.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.560
One is an object off.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.260
This time it will say e externally to dark person.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.990
But when I call this people don't print audience.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.760
What fight under the Spuyten takes this particular friends and passes that as a first

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.010
argument over here,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.990
but I haven't defined any variables,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.520
so it is going to be another.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.550
So let's give it a try and go back to command.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.030
Prompt.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.630
Not that I'm already in my work folder.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.740
I simply have to say quite on tree.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.040
He extremely do that.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.420
Anyway,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.000
when a press enter,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.330
you can see that it starts giving another twin details.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.970
Take zero positional arguments,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.520
but one waas given and that is that P Wonder printed is it says that you have supplied one

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.160
argument.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.940
No,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.800
what I have done is that I have not suffered an argument.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.580
But I called this function using an object.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.060
So what,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.120
Right under this fighting is going to look into the data type of P one,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.070
which is person,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.210
and it now knows that person class has print details.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.430
Bite on is gonna call the print details on your behalf,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.160
and it supplies this P one as the first argument now,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.390
since I'm not calling this print details,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.640
but Vital is calling by supplying people at the first argument,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.310
we are getting this error.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.100
Soto on why this island to cohere received this p one as some variable so in order to

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.650
receive this,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.130
be one.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.820
Let's define a new variable here.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.050
Let's call it as ref,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.350
just as an example,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.180
but a general practices used the world self.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.930
Although it is not a cure,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.300
it is a special type of variable name for fightin.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.000
That's where this editor says,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.290
highlighting self as if it's a keeper.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.310
But it's not a keeper.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.340
So I'm giving here,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.760
ref,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.540
and now I am no problem.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.670
You can see that been around this script,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.080
it simply says Printed is called,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.390
but we know that breath is nothing but P one.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.530
And inside this particular function,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.940
because this is a member from Children class person,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.430
you have access to the private like variables.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.500
I can print that.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.110
For example,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.670
I can say her Instead of printing this dummy message,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.120
I can see your name equals two American say breath start,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.250
double underscored mean on the same thing I can do for City.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.190
I'll type your left our city.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.940
What other really will be given on then one more is you.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.270
May,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.050
which is left,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.380
are double underscore evening Now if you write some other variable here and if that very

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.450
well doesn't exist you may get an adult saying that such an attribute doesn't exist.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.800
So right now this is OK,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.590
so let's go here and then try once more.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.280
Let me clear this cream and then access this once again you'll see that it is name Nichols

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.840
to be no city good student email accounts.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.780
Do we know that we know that?

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.240
Go.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.850
Let's go back to our core.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.640
We have a day off printing the leaders,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.030
but we don't have a way of changing this name.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.990
For example,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.870
if a type you're the one dot double underscore name equals toe,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.490
come on and then copy paste the same thing,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.310
you will see that it's goingto get the exact same details just to differentiate between the

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.350
two or ports.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.040
Let's give a blank print line so we go back and then try this.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.210
Now you will see that both occasions it's still giving the same thing.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.090
Now I'm not able to change the name of the person in this fashion,

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.690
but let's say I really want to change the name of the person,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.350
and I don't have a way of doing this in languages like Java and C plus plus,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:49.710
we go and write a function here for each of these venerate three functions to change the

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.110
values.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.930
For example,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.260
I'm gonna write a function here called Death.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.460
I'll probably call it as set underscored name where I received cell for the perimeter

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.840
because of the member function on then name as a parameter will posit on toe self dark,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.030
doubling the score need like this so that whenever we want to pass on some value,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.810
we can call this function on if you want.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.660
You can also supply default value,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.500
but the whole purpose of calling this function is that you want to set some names.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.660
So obviously there's no need off writing a default value here.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.270
But now I can come here and then say people in darts set underscored name off,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.590
Let's say,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.200
for example,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.550
Come on so I can go here and then try the same thing.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.950
You can see that the name has been changed.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.670
Basically,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.440
if you want to make the changes to city or email,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.810
you have to write those corresponding functions as well.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.360
So death set email,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.790
which received a self on email,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.830
and then I'd say you're self taught.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.690
Double underscore.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.450
He really goes to email on the same thing I might have to repeat for the city as what

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.660
Somebody copy Paste.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.030
Make the changes off all email here with City,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.690
so we have no set email.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.100
Sex City If you have a number off private variables for this object,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.950
you may have to write a number off centers like this.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.150
But the name of the function themselves can be anything.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.640
It's just a convention that we just write like this.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.970
So let's change the city on email as well.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.970
So we're gonna save people.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.460
Got set city off.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:22.770
Let's say,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.550
for example,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.800
Chennai on that the people darts.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:35.290
That email is Kumar at example dot com Now that we have changed the values off p one even

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.480
in the same object,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.030
but its values have been changed.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.860
So that's going.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.390
Try this.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.570
Let's clear this screen and try once more.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.090
You'll see that the first time we have the note.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.570
None.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.260
And we know that we know that go.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.470
But it has been changed to come March and I and commodity example dot com
