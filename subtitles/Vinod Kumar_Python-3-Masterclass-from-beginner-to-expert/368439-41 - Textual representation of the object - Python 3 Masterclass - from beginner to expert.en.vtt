00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
in this video.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.180
Let's have a quick look at how a person object can be printed directly without having toe

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.480
call.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.100
The print details function are,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.990
in other words,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.570
how we can represent a person object in a text format.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.040
To do that,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.780
let's goto a command front.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.260
In fact,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.920
let's go into a potential.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.650
And then let's say we want to use the person plus here,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.900
but we know that it's part of E X 22 so I can see you're from E X 22.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.040
I can say import Coursen,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.970
and now we got the person.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.600
And if I take your theory are off person,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.980
you'll see that it has got all these members.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.200
And these are the four members that I added.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.570
Before that,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.150
it has inherited on these members from a classic or object.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.130
More about inheritance will be alone in a lecture called inheritance,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.090
but importantly,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.700
you can see that there is one special function.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.850
Here are an attribute called double underscore str double underscore.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.920
This can be used for textual representation,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.690
for example,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.200
I say you're p one equals toe person named equals toe.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.920
We note city equals toe that kangaroo on a demon equals two.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.130
We know that in Order Co Since these are keyboard arguments,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.870
you can pass them in Any order.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.650
Doesn't matter.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.920
But if I simply that the one you see that it is p one is an instance off e x 22 person on

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.740
it says that the others it's giving it a specific format.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.500
Now it is actually coming from this.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.410
Str done the function for example and safety one dot double underscore str double

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.210
underscore notice the double underscore attributes are functions They're not meant for me

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.150
to call it used internally but I just want to prove a point that b one is MSP one dot

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.350
dunder str You can see exactly same thing.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.480
So if I can overwrite dysfunction and redundant string,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.620
that makes sense.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.760
Then whenever I said p one r print,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.230
be one,

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.060
it might actually give me a valid information.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.380
So four days I'm gonna go back to my court and overwrite a function called str just like

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.900
this one.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.760
Some will right?

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.710
Right below this,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.570
I'll say your death double on the score str double into school self is required because p

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.140
one is past as an argument when you're trying to print P one on.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.250
All I have to do is to return a string here.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.880
I can use the formula Street like,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.500
for example,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.110
like and say name equals toe could live bracket email equals to another college racket on.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.150
Then City equals toe another curly bracket dot format.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.800
It needs three parameters on their self taught double.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.770
Underscore me self door trouble underscored email.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.270
Self dot double underscore city.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.290
So I'm actually returning a formatted string using the self member variables.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.940
But if I go back to the financial on,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.940
try toe reprint that it will still show me this because the person class waas loaded when

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.570
we did this import here.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.470
So even if you do an import again,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.980
it says that the plus has already been imported.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.590
It will not be importing again.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.810
So let's exit the shell on,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.850
then get back again.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.680
And now if I say here from the extremely to import person it has imported the new Russian

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.960
and now if I assign P one with somebody loose and then if attacked the one,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.730
you'll see that it shows like this.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.450
But if I say printed p one,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.610
you should see that name equals.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.850
Do we know the medicals to?

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.890
You know that we know that call city Costa Bangla has been printed.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.160
So this is how you can represent an object of a class in a text format by overrating str

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.370
dunder function in that particular class.
