00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
In the previous lecture on member functions,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.560
we learned that private like variables can be modified by using functions like set names

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.730
that cities a female.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.330
The primary reason why you want to do that is because if you let the user assigned directly

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.210
than user may as an wrong type of values,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.170
whereas because this being a function before I can assign the value,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.680
I can actually verify whether the name is a str or is it an integer and so on and so forth

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.280
so we can do some basic relegation before we can assign?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.680
And,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.020
of course,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.990
if you have the functions defined here,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.540
you are supposed to call something like this.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.050
How we were fighting also provides something called Center and Get Our Properties,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.500
using which you can use them as if they're variables.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.370
But the definition is behind the scene,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.230
like a function in this video.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.150
Let's see how to create such properties.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.520
So I'm gonna remove these function Paul's Onda.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.630
We also delete the function definitions,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.180
but we want to see what is the name of the person city or email off the person.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.580
Let's also get it off these two on then say here Print P one dot name is and then I'm gonna

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.640
type your people,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.450
talk me,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.730
and also copy paste the same thing for the email city.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.460
So changes to email changes Toe city.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.420
Of course,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.330
if I go and run the court,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.940
we're gonna get an error because name email city are not valid attributes off people.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.400
The internal attributes are dunder named Unversity It on the email.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.430
We have removed the functions also.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.660
So let's give it a try and see what's the other bigger.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.860
Get notice that I'm in my work directory and I'm going to say by country be extra Tito that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.620
people on it's gonna come back with another saying that person object has no attribute

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.450
called name.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.610
Of course,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.800
if I'm gonna come in this hour,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.360
then there will be another for this effect.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.910
Come and that will be another for this.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.320
Now,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.000
in orderto access the underscore underscore name Citi email In this format,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.580
we're gonna write some function called name email City.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.050
So that's a death name.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.770
We have to pause the self as the perimeter and I'm gonna say your return Self doubt Dunder

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.180
name.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.870
Now,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.750
since this is a one liner.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.670
You can always bring this in the same line as this.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.600
No problem.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
But notice that if you know,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.620
actually run the court people in dirt name is a function.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.580
So instead of calling the function,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.650
it will simply say that it's a functions if ago,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.000
Here,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.860
run this,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.940
you'll see that people don't name if you look at this carefully.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.150
It is a bond method of persons.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.920
It says that people don't name is a function on your not called it,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.500
of course.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.120
So in order to get the name,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.530
we actually have to call it.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.650
We don't want to do that.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.990
We want to still use it like a variable itself.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.950
All you have to do is to say your until it property.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.670
Now,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.180
at the ID,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.850
property is called as a decorator and invite and three decorators can be used for having

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.540
some meta data about functions.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.250
In this case,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.370
we simply say,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.750
even though this is a function user is allowed to use it like a variable.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.320
So that's what we're gonna do here and the same thing.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.190
I'm gonna copy this on base.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.950
You're a couple of times one for email and one for city.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.970
So I'm gonna change this to human on this one to city.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.890
Now you'll see that when I actually run this a script were actually accessing people,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.840
not name,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.430
which is actually a function.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.800
But we have defined it as a property,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.430
so we are allowed to access it as if it's available.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.570
So let's go give it a try.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.240
On this time,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.000
you can see that we are able to access the internal private like variables as public

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.780
variables.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.770
People not name people,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.580
not email human,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.190
not city.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.090
But this doesn't mean that we can change the values.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.660
For example,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.220
if a type your from be one dot city equals two,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.060
for example,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.330
from bangle or does a kangaroo.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.490
And if I tried toe run the same,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.400
you're gonna get another error,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.530
and the other says attributed our concept attribute it is that while you are able to access

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.890
the value,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.800
there's no problem.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.930
But when you're tryingto assigned the value,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.850
there is an issue.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.540
So for this,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.650
we had to create another function which can take this right hand side value and assign that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.850
to the internal property like this.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.100
So the way you can do is for each of the property.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.410
You write one more function this time it's a function to take para meter.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.440
So we have to say you are supplying and name because whatever the right hand side off this

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.250
assignment,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.900
it is considered at the perimeter.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.540
So we're gonna get that cure,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.910
and then we will take with self dot dunder name equals to name and the same thing we're

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.600
gonna do for other do.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.040
But we also have to say that this is a center for this particular property.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.050
The way you do it.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.900
They say here at named Art Center,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.070
named being the property Vitti,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.030
find over here.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.980
Likewise,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.430
I'm gonna right here one more as a activated email door center.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.390
But that's a function called E Made which this yourself and another perimeter.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.240
But what it's gonna do it It's going to say,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.030
self taught,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.630
double into scored email equals to email.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.670
So we received that email as a right turn state of the assignment,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.010
and then we ascended toe this member variable Like what?

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.130
We're gonna do the same thing for city with after it citi dot I said,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.420
Oh,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.210
on a function city where self is the walking object on the left.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.420
Trent.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.600
Sir,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.100
you say,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.520
be one dot City.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.010
You may say that is gonna be the self here,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.560
people.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.760
And then city is the perimeter.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.120
All of you to do is to say,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.050
self dart,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.560
double underscore city equals toe City.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.080
Now that we have got all these three,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.060
we should be able to change on the values off this p one that people not name it calls toe

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.250
way not Come on on,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.200
then be wondered.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.460
Email equals toe,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.240
for example.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.340
Say we know at gmail dot com Now that we've changed it,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.150
we can actually print the values using the print details against if even dot print

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.710
underscore Petit takes.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.410
Let's give it a try here,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.060
this green and then try this again and you will see that we changed the values using the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.440
assignment operator using these properties.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.750
Now
