00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
in this video,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.710
let's discuss about a special programming principal card precaution where a function calls

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.390
itself.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.120
Let's take an example first.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.640
It's 14 dot be considered a scenario.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.820
Factorial off end is nothing but the end times factorial off and minus one.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Obviously,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.300
you can see that the expression consists off the original function itself,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.710
but with the modified value.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620
So if you want to know calculate,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.250
what is this particular expression going to look like?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.300
His end in tow n minus one in tow.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.960
Factorial off in minus two on the same thing Now continues upto and terminating condition,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.330
so you have to have some contaminates it great area.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.460
The exit predator in this case would be,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.160
but end the richest one.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.250
You don't want to really go further because factory love one is supposed to be one.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.910
So with this concept now I can take the function called factorial.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.220
It's called best Factorial.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.660
Here.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.380
Off end is nothing but return the same thing in times factorial off end minus one.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.360
But of course,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.000
if I just do this,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.230
then it's never going to stop because it's continuously going to call this function with a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.110
different value and again and again and again and again.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.130
So you always started the exit prettiness saying,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.420
If yen is less than or because toe one,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.730
we simply said return one.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.320
So obviously you can see that if you are going toe,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.990
go with this value so initially feared started with,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.310
say,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.830
five.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.680
This is five in tow,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.390
four in tow,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.550
factory love treat and factorial off to the factorial of one.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.000
When this becomes one,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.920
we're actually meeting this particular criteria.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.040
We're going to return one.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.220
So because we're returning one the Rick Ocean storms and their expression is valued it and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.120
the result is going to be received.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.040
So I'm well,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.410
check this out by typing death May and then call this particular factorial by asking the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.740
value from the user.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.400
Let's they number equals.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.950
Tow it input ender a number.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.620
And once the user in the number,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.800
I'm gonna assign toe factorial off that numb.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.740
And then after that print,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.280
say factorial off person,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.320
he eats person,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.970
be on supply the value numb.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.480
And then let's call the main as well.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.580
If Dunder name equals toe under me,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.850
then we're gonna call the main function,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.150
save this go to the command front.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:48.000
I don t e export in the p y ender number five it's supposed to be 1 20 we got 1 20 as the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.550
output.
