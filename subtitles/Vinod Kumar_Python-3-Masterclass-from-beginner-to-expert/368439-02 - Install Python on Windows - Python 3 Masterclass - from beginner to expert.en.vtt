00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.350
Let's have a look at how to install python on Microsoft Windows.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.350
First,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.550
let's open a browser and with it by thunder on.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.710

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.970

You may go to this particular league,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.880
but for this training we're gonna use despite on 3.7 point three click on this button know

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.410
that the download is done.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.750
Let's go and open the same.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.780
And that brings improviser,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.650
which is your install now or customized installation.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.890
We can go out with the before installation set up.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.450
This includes a simple editor on Durant.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.080
A man woman called I Do the Package installer for Fightin and Documentation.

such as Dark B Y files with the Idol.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:08.570

Russian in some cases like mine.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.960
So it says that by Don is not recognized as an internal or external command.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.580
This is mainly because the pipeline was not at toe your system part.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.050
So protect the part.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.650
You can see that there is a bunch of folders here,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.910
but quite done is not one off them.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.840

You may have toe actually type in manually update on local programs and fight on.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.250
So there's the location where by done 3.7 has been installed.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.080
And as you can see,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.770
that there is an executable here called Fighter.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.640
