00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
a lot of times you want toe execute a statement in a repetitive more.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.550
For example,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.230
you want,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.690
except a number and printer multiplication table,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.080
where you may want to calculate the product off the input number from the user eight times

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.140
one times two times three etcetera,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.750
etcetera,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.300
probably for 10 times,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.790
are 15 times 20 times.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.090
That's it.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.430
So let's give it a try as how this can be done so really clear.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.460
A new fine here yet 06 Start people.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.580
And then let's say we want to accept a number and print the multiplication table for the

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.000
same.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.290
To do this,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.230
let's first accept and number it,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.890
Quotes told.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.350
Didn't input under a number.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.570
And I presume that the user endorsed seven.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.660
Now what we want to do is we wanna print seven times one equals 277 times two equals 2 14 7

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.350
times three calls to 21 swan so forth until probably seven times 10 or seven times 20.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.430
It's up to you.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.830
So if you want to do some job repeatedly,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.950
we do have a couple of options.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.860
The first option here is called the White Group,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.710
so the names a dist.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.890
While condition is true,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.160
keep repeating.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.190
So let's hear.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.000
For example,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.100
I want to declare a variable which is assigned with one as the number.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.600
So I equals to one.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.150
Now I can check.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.110
Is it less than or equal?

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.750
Stood 10.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.090
So I can tell you're while I is less than articles to 10.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.390
I use a colon to indicate that I'm beginning a block off one or more statements.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.930
Now,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.240
as you can see that the value off eyes 11 less than Article Street 10 is definitely true.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.390
It now executives this block so I can type here plant and then I can use anyone off.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.950
Those meccas toe include the values.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.700
For example,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.450
I can say godly Brakhage X lived like it equals two curly bracket.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.190
Then I said dot format and then they number is the first patent.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.540
This is to be printed with our substituted.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.440
The second bracket to be substituted with the value of I'm a taller one,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.380
is the result,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.930
which is nothing but a number of times I So we're gonna get something like seven x one

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.150
equals 27 Now we have to know change the value of I so that next time it's going to say

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.260
seven times two equals toe 14.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.810
So this can be done by using the shorthand operator I plus equals to one which increments

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.350
the value of I said.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.560
This is same as I equals toe I plus one,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.630
but much more simplistic away.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.250
So it's a plus equals to one now,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.610
After this is done,

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.240
I don't have anything else to do.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.960
So what actually bite an interpreter does is it's gonna go back and reevaluate this

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.670
condition and checks here that I,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.640
which is currently 22 is less than or equal to 10.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.890
So it means seven times two equals 2 14 It's printed,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.490
and then I becomes three three,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.970
less than or equal to 10 years again.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.430
True.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.680
So it's gonna print something that I becomes 44 less than or equal to 10.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.940
This continues upto nine,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.520
and then,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.690
when I becomes pen 10 less than a recorded earlier is still true.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.740
It prints the last one,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.910
and then it becomes 11.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.470
Now,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.810
when it becomes 11 again,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.250
it'll go and check 11 less than or equal to 10 which is false.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.680
Now.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.350
That condition has Bean turned into force.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.600
So this block is now skipped.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.560
And what else?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.080
It is there.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.610
So it's gonna come out on,

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.150
then print whatever that we give over here,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.000
for example,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.810
I can say print by statement,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.620
save this and then I'm gonna go and run the theme.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.940
So this time,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.250
as a white country,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.550
you 06 31 it is ender number.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.190
I'm gonna breast seven and you'll see that I get the multiplication table for seven safe.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.460
I want toe increase the multiplication toe upto 20.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.820
All I have to do is tow chain.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.140
This number to 20 are.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.430
You can also ask the user What is the limit up to which they either want.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.650
So I can say limit equals toe eat input and the limit.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.680
And now I can change this toe limit instead of 10.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.750
Where the user deserves how big the multiplication table.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.910
He or she wants them to save this,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.520
go back,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.150
execute the same thing that they endure.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.710
Remember,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.180
say,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.450
for fine LTD's 15 on you can see 45 multiplication table upto 15 is sprinter.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.060
Of course,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.240
I should give some deal emitter days.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.460
I can put a colon on space or on the same thing once more.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.640
It's a 45 and then I'll say 20.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.080
We get the multiplication table for 45 up to 20.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.210
Let's take another example.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.290
So this time I want to find out the factorial offered given number,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.650
which is the product off all numbers between one and itself.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.770
So I'm gonna go create a new file eg $07 B y.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:27.190
That's a number equals toe into input under a number Barbie you calculate the factory in

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.120
now,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.210
in case it the number happens to be negative,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.530
we might want oh,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.880
specify that there is no factory for the same.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.800
Let's declare a variable for our loop,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.090
which is equals to one on.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.040
We also are going to declare a variable called F,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.160
which is going to contend the factorial off the number entered by the user.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.720
So let's begin a loop by using while I less than r equals toe numb.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.550
And then I say here,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.550
yeah,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.460
equals toe f times.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.950
I'd as you know,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.870
that initial value of F is one initial value of eyes one.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.150
Both of them are multiplied with each other.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.780
The reserve that one is stored in f And now I'm gonna go incriminate this I by one.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.930
So I said,

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.890
I Plocica's toe want when eyes increment,

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.850
it's gonna go back here and checks.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.130
I left them out because to not,

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.560
let's assume that the user has endured for so the eyes to do less than medical before.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.370
It's true now F,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.050
which is one multiplied by two So one times two is to do is stored over here.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.830
When I becomes three again,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.980
the condition is true.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.360
So this time it's already toe do in tow.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.090
36 now six installed.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.800
Over here I becomes 44 less than record before It's true.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.500
So this is six and then this is for 24 So we store 24 over here.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.480
When this becomes five files Don Rickles toe Forest Falls,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:01.310
we come out of the group and then I can say your trade factorial all wasn't Age d is

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.810
percentage D and then we'll figure percentage.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.350
The first is basically numb on This is the calculator desert which is ever so I can see

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.330
you're numb and then f So let's save this on.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.830
Go back to the command front.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.550
Execute this the 7th 1 and then enter in the numbers,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.660
Let's say four American status factory LaForest 24 that enter five.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.320
It's gonna be 1 20 I can go on and on,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.170
and we get a very large number and kill if I give a bigger number as well.
