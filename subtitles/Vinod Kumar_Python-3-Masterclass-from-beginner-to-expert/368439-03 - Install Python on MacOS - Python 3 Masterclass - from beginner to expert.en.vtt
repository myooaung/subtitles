00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
in this lecture.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.090
Let's have a look at how to install Fight on on our computer.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.750
First,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.130
let's open a browser and visit bite under on and under the down roots menu.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.250
You can see that there is a button here called White on 3.7 point three.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.220
For older Russians,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.550
you can visit this one,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.150
but in this case I want to download the latest one click on this button.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:38.610
Select my desktop you can save once the dollar has been completed.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.950
It's close Groom,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.580
and we'll see that there is despite on 3.7 point three Mac or six $10.9 package.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.390
So I just double click that this brings up a result.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.310
Andi.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.750
It's a straightforward,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.820
step by step.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.580
Installation procedure certainly can continue.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.150
Read the license agreement.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.650
Click on Continue.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.420
A brief notable what Fortunes Off Vital and water shipped along with a python is explained

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.050
Over here.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.310
Click on.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.710
Continue the license agreement.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.310
Click on,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.300
Continue again,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.820
agreed a license in case.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.290
If you would like to change the vitamins D for location,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.880
you can click on this to change.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.950
I would like to keep it to the same and then click install,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.470
ask for the administrator of religious and it has finished installation.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.770
And this the location where they have a fight on people from seven.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.160
And it says,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.260
Congratulations bite on 3.7 point 34 Mac,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.600
always 10.9 or later,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.960
was successfully installed.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.550
So let's click on close.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.600
I don't need this package.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.500
Find anymore.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.100
I can delete this.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.460
I know to check if Brighton has been successfully installed or not.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.050
That's open and terminal on chick.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.250
Well done,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.980
Dr Washington on Mac,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.740
you can see that it chose 2.7 point 10.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.180
And that's primarily because Mac worst comes to the fight.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.400
On by itself,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.490
the new Russian off Brighton has been installed within areas off fight on three.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.180
And if I select that and checked bite on three doctors wash in now it says bite on 3.7

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.760
point three.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.520
So on Mac Cory s,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.250
you have to be extra careful that every time you want to executive by transcript,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790
you type the command bite on three on district filing
