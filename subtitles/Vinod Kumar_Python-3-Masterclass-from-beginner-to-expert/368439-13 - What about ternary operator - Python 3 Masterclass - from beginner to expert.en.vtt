00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
If you're coming from C C plus plus Java or C shop,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.090
you're familiar with something called ordinary operator in Python.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.870
We don't have this eternally operator or something equal and off switch case.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.450
Also,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.510
however,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.410
we do have an Internet for eternity.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.030
Operator.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.830
So let's take an example to understand the same,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.210
I'm gonna create a new file called Year 05 30 by where I'm gonna accept the name and each

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.060
off a person.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.990
And then if the person is less than 18 years old that I want to say that the person is a

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.520
minor,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970
our person is an adult,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.920
so I can see here name equals toe input.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:52.950
Enter a name and then I'll type your age equal store in tough input under the age now that

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.450
we have accepted name and each let's create a variable to say person type,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.310
whether he or she is a minor or in other,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.450
let's assume that we're gonna die minor and then I say,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.180
give each is less than 18.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.540
Yes,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.920
I can say other.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.420
So this is how you use a eternally operators equal int where I'm actually assigning minor

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.970
only if this condition is true and If the condition is false,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.810
then this is not gonna be assigned.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.510
But this particular text which is uttered,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.890
will be assigned over here and now I can,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.360
of course,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.990
print We're typing.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.410
Percentage s is a person beach as percent age.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.490
And then I can say your need for sun underscore pipe.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.170
So the first person stage s will be replaced with me,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.570
and second percentage s will be replaced with person type.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.050
Let's save this and go to the command front.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:01.000
Execute the scene by typing by country you 0531 on it's gonna ask them name the tape,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.880
for example.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.720
Romish,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.120
I'll say 45.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.220
And he conceded,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.000
Ramesh is a adult.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.520
And then,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.000
of course,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.630
I'm gonna ride the same name with For example,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.240
12.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.830
It is.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440
Ramesh is a minor
