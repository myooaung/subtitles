00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
apart from numbers on strings,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:12.440
There is another importantly that I call bull IANs are bull for example again say time off

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.440
.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.020
True if I say it is that the class is full and I can also died dear your boon to see what

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.150
kind of functions are activity we have and you can see that they're more like indigenous.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.570
However,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.430
I cannot interchange integers as well as bullion.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.350
A bullion are always gonna contain true our phones.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.690
So they are going to be resulting from comparison operators.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.750
For example,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.010
I can say anyone equals 202 equals toe 200.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.130
I can always see,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.720
hear,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.750
say Tia equals toe anyone less than in two.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.650
So which happens to be a comparison operator.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.140
We also call this as a relation operator.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.420
So if I say no,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.600
what is TF?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.560
You can see it s true because 100 is less than 200.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.510
Verify in to change the operator on.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.050
Then check the same thing.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.510
It said the response bullion czar used exhaustively in conditional branching or it'll

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.080
ations such as loops where we may have to check the condition and then do some ultimate

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
steps are a repetitive tasks One very important aspect.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.850
You may have to keep in mind if you're especially if you're coming from other programming

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.490
languages.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.180
Is that the values true and false?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.890
Start with Captain Litter.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.030
So this is a valid True.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.390
This is considered now variable,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.860
which we have not created,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.080
and it comes back and says name at a There is no name called true defined.
