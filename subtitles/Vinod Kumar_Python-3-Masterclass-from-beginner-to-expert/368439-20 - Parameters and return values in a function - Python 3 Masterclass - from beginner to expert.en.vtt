00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
in Brighton,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.880
both perimeters and the return values for optional.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.540
It's taken example,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.900
forced by creating a new file years $13 B wait and then a function called greed.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.680
So by doing death,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.240
greet and then I can say your name and city as two parameters.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.940
Let's say the intention here is to accept a name from the user along with the city,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.060
and then greet him,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.120
saying that Hello,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.850
So on so hovers weather in your city.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.540
So I'm gonna print hello Percentage s.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.360
He's with a percentage s,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.190
which is like,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.660
Hello.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.640
We know how is whether in Bangla and I have to supply two values for the 2% ages It is

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.250
nothing but name and city.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.070
Now,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.010
as you can see,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.970
that the function needs to parameters here.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.110
But it's not returning value.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.920
So let's define and Maine where I can call these the exam on except the name entity from

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:15.330
the user and with a name equals toe input in your me and then I can say city input they are

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.300
you from.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.600
And that's supposed to be the city.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.690
So I'll say your read name.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.130
Come on,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.760
City.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.460
Now I'm calling the function the function will now receive the value input by the user the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.230
name and city as the same variables here,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.930
but notice that these variables to find here are different than the two variables.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.010
They're defined here,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.550
but coincidently,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.570
they have the same names.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.290
In this case,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.630
it prints the value and comes out after function with some D for the return value called

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.150
None.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.210
You fit on.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.790
You assigned this greed toe available,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.540
Corlett said.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.920
Message equals two and then say,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.530
What is that message?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.680
So I can say different message ease.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.130
And then I say message.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.350
You'll see that the message is none because we didn't return any value from here.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.290
One last thing that we have to do is tow,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.250
calm the main.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.500
If done,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.580
the name equals two under me.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.400
Then we would like to call the main function Notice that this time I didn't have toe press

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.160
enter because there's only one line of executions.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.840
I can do that in the same line as well.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.190
I saved this.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.520
Go to the command round run fight on three years,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.190
$30 b white on.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.380
Then it's going to say in the name I'll enter my name we're from from Bangle was indoor.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.540
It says your hollow.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.040
We know I was whether in Bangla message is none and that's because there was no return

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.690
value from there now just because we don't have a return value,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.610
it doesn't mean that we can are assign because conditionally,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.690
I may return something.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.480
And if the condition fades,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.150
I'm in art it on any value at all.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.970
So that's how the assignment can be and none as well.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.810
However,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.490
in this case it's used less.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.840
But let's say way also don't want to pass on the values,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.030
name and city,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.050
so I can directly say here,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.300
greet off letter,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.240
for example,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.270
we note on not possibility for city.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.190
Now what happens is when we call this video will be a cento name and city will not get any

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.650
value.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.000
Now this according to fight on these X syntax.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.780
So if I save this run the court that's right.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.640
My name Angulo Ender.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.060
You can see it went upto this part where it said hello.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.620
You know how is better in Bangla and then messages none.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.280
And then because it is being interpreted when it comes over here until hey,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.660
you're passing less values.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.150
For example,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.170
if you look at the message,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.550
it has agreed missing one required positional argument city.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.990
But this can be ordered by assigning a default value to city.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.580
For example.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.260
I can assign a message or saying that your city saying that in game if you don't supply a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.480
value for that,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.220
then city will be your city.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.750
So,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.110
off course,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.100
when I around this it's gonna say hello.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.030
We know how is whether in your city So save this going down the same thing once again.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.490
This time I'll enter.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.440
Let's say tomorrow.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.850
Bungalow and press enter.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.980
This is the message.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.690
First time.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.130
Hello,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.650
Kumar.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.100
How is whether in Bangla there's a 2nd 1?

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.310
Wait,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.380
I didn't supply the city It it is hollow.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.420
We know how is whether in your city you can also assigned default values toe all the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.780
parameters if you want.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.480
For example,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.180
I can say your friend so I can simply say your street without even supplying any value.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.560
So in this case,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.440
of course,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.160
we are accepting the values,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.050
printing the message,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.180
which is nothing here and then I'm not passing city here.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.420
I'm not passing name as well so you will see that it's going to say,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.690
Hello,

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.210
friend.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.530
How is whether in your city?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.430
So let's give a try and selects a James Dallas on then you can see it in Hello,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.200
James have is whether,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.420
in Dallas that the first message the second limited Hello,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.400
we know because we know that the name supplied.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.100
How is whether in your city certain I didn't cost any parameters?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.210
It's a hello friend.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.670
How is whether in your city?

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.800
So the default parameters can be given to variables,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.690
which allows the user to call the functions without having to pass values for all the

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.470
perimeters?

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.970
One thing you have to keep in mind is that if you assign a default Violeta Parameter,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.630
then the subsequent parameters also must have a default value.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.220
For example,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.910
if I removed days on,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.840
then let's say,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.900
for example,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.940
do not even call any off them.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.550
Doesn't matter if I stay this and go back and try running this,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.160
you'll see that it says there is a better syntax error,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.440
non default arguments almost before argument.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.650
So this is a non different argument.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.510
But as this is the default argument,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.000
you cannot give it like this,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.630
but you could give the other William,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.110
Let me undo this by dressing.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.460
Commands it on Mac controls it on windows on.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.290
Bring it back.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.510
You can see that I can have a perimeter without any D for value.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.430
But the last one,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.790
I can have a perimeter.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.790
That's not a problem.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.000
But if you slap that like,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.920
I want to have a deeper for name,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.020
but not for city,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.100
that is not alone.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.040
So let's save this running one last time to ensure that everything is OK.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.630
So type your some name.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.270
We know Angulo and I get the message is appropriately.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.810
You can also have return values to carry a summary off.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.360
What is the operation done?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.850
By the particular function to the color,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.970
for example,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.430
I'm gonna have a function over here squared on.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.850
Then that takes a number as a perimeter returns the number of times number,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.410
which is a simple court,

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.990
of course.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.070
But when I called dysfunction,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.410
I'm carrying the summary off the particular operation.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.160
So in this case,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.700
it's supposed to complete the square,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.020
and it is doing the same thing so I can come down here with me,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.660
Commander,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.590
All this except a number from the use of this time and equals.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.780
Tow it input in tow a number.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:36.330
And then I can see your s ur people toe square off end and then I can bring square off

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.710
person D is person B person.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.610
The square off end is sq off that the calculated value I saved this.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.580
Run the program once again it's gonna ask Enter a number that's a 23 100 square off 23 is

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.940
529.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:01.520
A function can also written more than one value unlike many other programming languages.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.370
For example,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:08.810
if I can come here and say they're square underscore Cube and then take known as a

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:14.610
perimeter then I can say here return I can say no storm down.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.770
That's for the square.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.300
Come on,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:22.870
Numb star numb start No to call the same I can say here Yes,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.260
you're Come on,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:33.270
C b equals two square cube off any Since this is returning to values like this,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:39.510
this is the value one on value to We have toe assigned toe to wait tables simultaneously.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.770
And then when I get this,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.150
I can print the value so I can say print,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:49.350
Ask your course 2% d C B equals to personally put a percent,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.710
and then it's the S Q R C,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.350
U B as two variables.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:59.620
And when on this now you should see that it should give me the square as well.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.850
Ask you so this is something very special and different compared toa other languages,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.630
like C C plus plus Java,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.320
where return value can only carry one single value.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.320
Whereas in Brighton I can return as many values as I want toe collect them.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.300
You have to assign the equal number of variables that have been written.
