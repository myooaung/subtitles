00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
the plants.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.260
Str,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.450
which allows us to create stream object,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.870
is one of the most commonly are widely used data type in Fightin on str is simply a texture

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.780
that you're ender with the help of a court which can be a single or double courts.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.240
For example,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.560
I can see here need equals toe,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.380
we note in single courts are I can say name two equals toe double course we don't which are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.670
identical So you can check here now by typing idea off name and I d off name to They put

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.750
our seem because both of them are referencing toe the same object.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:55.750
The object we know God constructed in the first time here and was referenced by this name.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.650
But later,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.310
when I assigned using a double court fight don't realize is that the object were not

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.910
already exist and just simply gets the reference off that so there is only one str off

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.390
Corby.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.150
Not both name one unnamed toe are pointing toe referencing to the same thing.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.430
Sometimes a string may consist off double or single course as part of their text.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.370
For example,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.950
if I want to say name on name three equals toe on Fred.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.200
The solos are,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.980
And now you can see this is gonna be a problem because the beginning court gets terminated

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.850
over here.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.410
And this is an editor because you can't simply type whatever that you want here.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.390
So this is gonna cause a problem.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.030
It is that invalid syntax that this can be best are just by typing.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.470
Named three equals toe in double course.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.960
You say,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.630
Alfred,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.150
and then single courts is going to be part of that like this.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.700
So the double cords which got open over here gets terminated only at this point in time on

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.360
now fight.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.440
And we'll assume that this is an actual character you wanted inside the string and not a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.980
ending off any open course or not a beginning off a course that is going to be terminated

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.520
at the end.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.130
So this is not a problem.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.310
Now we can see Name three is no problem.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.960
I can say print name three,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.280
and its influence on traditions are something like this.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.040
However,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.880
you may not be able to combine both off them.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.860
For example,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.130
what if I want tohave a valuable called height which says,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.980
for example,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.510
five feet 10 inches.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.420
So if I type your five and then we use a single court to say this feat and the 10 interest

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.770
rate.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.790
So in a double course now,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.850
obviously my idea is that the courts which has opened here is terminated the end making

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.580
this five feet 10 inch as a value.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.590
But this is going to give a problem because it assumes that the courts that got open in the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.120
beginning God terminated right here and the last two double courts that we see here is not

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.550
alone.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.260
So if I pressed enter,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.680
this is going to cause a Guinness syntax error.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.850
It is end off line while scanning for a string literal.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.150
Now this is where we can use an escape characters,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.750
for example.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.270
The same thing I can use now with in a bag slash behind the double courts.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.150
So the combination of the slash and the double court is now considered as a single

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.880
character,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.530
and then it is going to be part off the actual text.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.140
So which means the opening court here is terminated at the end by the last one over here,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.450
and this is perfectly alright on against a print height and I should get this five feet 10

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.000
inches.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.950
Something like that.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.300
I can also allows you toe use.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.250
A three single courts are treatable ports to represent the string,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.110
for example,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.400
I can clearly variable called My address equals two three single courts,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.920
followed by whatever that just I want you,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.810
for example,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.750
I can say elegant a light.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.780
I can even enter here so that it comes to the next line.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.020
So the purpose of using this treatable courts are three single courts is toe use a multi

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.870
line text.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.120
So until I use this somewhere in my text,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.760
it's not going to terminate,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.670
so I can give it in multiple lines.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.780
So it's the first cross.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:45.550
Trust me and I can actually first enter that I can have some other details.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.100
Let's say,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.750
for example,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.590
like Bangla.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.510
Now I want to close that I can use a three single courts.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.650
Now you can only use three single courts when you started with three single course.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.290
If you started with three double courts,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.180
you have to dominate that Big Three double courts press enter Now you can see that we are

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.750
back in the command front.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.020
You might also notice that when I pressed enter here after this particular text.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.500
I did not get the three great land symbols,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.110
but instead I got three dots.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.790
This is to say that the command is incomplete on it is waiting for me to give this three

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.930
single courts as soon as they dictated by President Enter.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.980
And now it says the rocket,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.050
the command is complete.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.110
Whatever was inside this three court is now becomes the value off my address.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.600
Now,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.960
if you simply type my address and press enter without using the print function,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.540
you can see a internal set of characters also,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.100
which represented that newly,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.860
the entire text is given to me as a string your residency single Kordic text.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.670
But wherever I had pressed,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:56.020
enter slash end waas included slash and corresponds to new line character on windows.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.870
Human even see slash our along with a slash end indicating new line carriage return.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.730
Of course,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.220
if you want to see them in multiple lines,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.530
use the free function and you can take my address and I should get this as it is when it is

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.540
an str.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.340
You can make yourself a lot of functions forward by str for example,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.210
if it i d i r s tia and look at only those which are not Dunder are double underscore

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.070
attributes.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.300
So these are the functions and variables that are available mostly these are all functions

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.370
So the capitalize is a function which can words postulator off each word in tow uppercase

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.760
converting the rest of them into lower kiss.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.690
Likewise,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.500
there is a function here called center with centers.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.620
The text There is a function called ends wit with checks whether the text ends with a

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.250
particular pattern or not.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.310
For example,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.210
I can check.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.820
Name is we know I can check name dot ends with say,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.600
for example,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.740
b R or D,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.550
for that matter.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.520
It is true.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.260
What I can check doesn't end with the like,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.540
you know,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.130
Come on,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.830
it is false so I can check with them A particular name on a text ends with a particular

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.950
pattern or not.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.280
You can also check.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.060
Is it a numerical value?

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.810
For example,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.010
if I have your X equals toe in single court,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.000
say 100 So that is a str.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.060
It's not a number,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.700
but it contends only numerical values.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.920
I can check your is new Marie on its is your too,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.370
because it condense only numerical values.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.530
But if I say X equals toe 100 minus 20 for whatever the reason and if I say here is it a

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.670
numerical value?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.750
It is false because minors cannot be part of a number.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.710
Likewise,

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.260
we have functions like,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.250
for example,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.880
there's a lawyer that's an upper which actually written the new string.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.600
Converting them into lower case are uppercase Washington,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.530
for example.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.520
I can say name,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.340
which is currently,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:09.760
you know,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.760
I can say name dot a poor and you will see that it is a poor case.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.930
But the original value in the name still is the lower case.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.810
We know it's a it's creating a new string under turning the same thing.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.700
There are a couple of functions which are more useful than the others.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:27.990
Like,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.590
for example,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.730
that split and join.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.350
Let's have a look at the same.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.150
So consider a variable cord.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:41.360
Cities equals toe on giving few cities like bangle my suit.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.310
Remember Andi?

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.790
Let's say so Now we have a string here,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.950
one str but it has four cities.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:09:00.810
I can convert them in tow unusual strings representing cities by calling City Start split.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.900
But then I have to say,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.130
What is the deal emitter?

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.620
Or what is that character that separates multiple cities?

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.860
You can see the two cities are separated is in common,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.160
so I can give a common here saying that Hey,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.940
comma is the the limiter,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.120
So split them.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.500
Wherever you find a comma,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.200
make them into pieces.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.450
So the return value off this now is a list.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.620
As you can see you,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.670
it's a group off Ste.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.110
Ours.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.900
So where I have a one value,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.750
it says Bangla.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.460
Another value is Mysore.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.030
Undervalue is Mumbai.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.130
Another value is day.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:41.330
So this is called a list and we have a whole section discussing about list later.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.520
But for the time being,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.080
I'm just gonna copy days and then Azan your data.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.390
It calls to test.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.450
And if I said type off data,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.910
it says it's a list.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.650
It's not a next year anymore.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.450
But of course,

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.810
if I say type off data off zero,

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.060
which happens to be the first element here,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.360
which is an SD eso data off zero is an str and you consider the next year.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.860
Now you can answer type printing data off.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.030
Zero did off one two on three off course.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.820
If I go beyond three,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.170
it's gonna give an editor.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.210
Now that I have this data,

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.570
can I convert them back to something like this with the different Demeter?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.040
Now,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.750
that's where at join comes into picture.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:31.370
So join needs a deal emitter first and then specify what to join.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.150
So I meant take your deal,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.690
emitter.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.770
Some variable equals toe,

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.780
for example.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.140
It's a double dash,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.240
so I want to use this double dash at the de limiter.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.300
So what can I do?

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.890
I can say Demeter or joint,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.400
and then I can save data.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.350
Now Data happens to be a list off all the unusual cities.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.390
I'm joining them using this deal emitter.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.830
So if I press enter,

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:03.670
you can see each one off those cities were taken and then baste it or joined using this

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.580
dash dash as the delivery disorder the millimeter you wanted you could have given,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.480
for example,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.010
I can say here IHS slash And now I can say the limiter join.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.650
It's gonna give you something like that.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.760
If you want,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.840
you can put a dot and then say join
