00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
in this lecture.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's have a look at what's called a weapon.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.850
Grapples time for really valued friend and loop.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.360
You understand this better?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.340
Let's open a terminal Onda time Wait on three.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.190
And obviously you have bean greeted with the wash in off white on.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.520
And then there is a bunch off.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.030
My said that it says type help,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.100
copyrights credits all license toe,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.850
Find more information and we see a new prompt over here.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.810
So this prompt is not your operating system.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.290
Prompt.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.990
For example,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.850
in my kid is not a macro has calmed in your gated minute with the Windows Command prompt.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.460
But it is a bite on command Prompt American type in any bite on command,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.420
for example,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.290
we can start right,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:01:01.230
I think print on the wood and when I pressed enter this command is red evaluated the result

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.090
this sprinter on Then it will wait for the next two command,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.550
hence looping.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.750
So we call it as really evil trained on loop,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.850
you can dive in any expressions like,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.610
for example,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.140
100 into 12 or,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.010
for that matter,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.550
too to the power off full and so on himself worked throughout this course we will be using

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.230
this rappel so that we can learn certain comments very quickly because the command are

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.030
going to be executed on instantaneously.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.150
We will see there isn't.
