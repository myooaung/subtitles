00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
right on is a gender pope was interpreted.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.650
Programming language created by Good award Blossom On was released in the year 1991.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.350
Why don't encourage us court reusability on the right fewer lines to express the concept?

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
Why don't supports both procedural as well s object oriented programming?

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.110
Many of the language we just support functional programming on aspect or in the programming

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.110
,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.460
too.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.080
The language was named after the popular TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.500
which was telecast in BBC between 1969 and 74 and has nothing to do with the snake bite

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.750
down.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.300
Here are some of the civilian features off fighter.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.100
It's free.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.550
It's open source.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.660
It's a high level programming language by 10.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.850
Programs are interpreted and hence are often effort as by dance groups.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.180
It offers portability.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.980
It is extensible and has a wants to library off packages which are reusable.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.050
Bite on models bite on being a very simple and easy to learn language can be used for

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.690
teaching programming to kids and non programmers.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.680
However,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.880
the language off for so many powerful features it can be useful.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.660
Already off applications suggests Web applications,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.920
same difficult numeric applications,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.870
creating self two prototypes in data analytics on in artificial intelligence applications

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.260
