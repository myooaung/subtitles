00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.005
- [Frank] If you work with cloud native technologies,

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.008
you cannot escape hearing about serverless.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:11.002
The concept of paying for the operations you use

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.002
versus the infrastructure

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.002
at 24 hours a day seven days a week

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.008
appeals in many specific use cases

7
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.001
in software engineering today.

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.008
Many people talk about serverless.

9
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.008
However, not everyone has a clear picture

10
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.008
of what it truly is.

11
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.006
This course will not only explain what serverless is,

12
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.005
but also answer the benefits and negatives

13
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.008
of this development toolkit.

14
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.000
We will look at specific use cases

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.003
for AWS's implementation of serverless, called Lambda,

16
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.004
and how to leverage this with several languages

17
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.002
to not only help you make appropriate decisions

18
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.007
on how but also when to use this technology.

19
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:56.006
Hi, I'm Frank Moley.

20
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.008
I'm a cloud native developer, architect, and manager

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.002
working in both public and private clouds

22
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:03.007
throughout my career.

23
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.001
I have consumed and even helped build

24
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.001
serverless technologies.

25
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.004
I am passionate about technology

26
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.001
and sharing that technology with others.

27
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:17.001
So, let's get ready to learn about cloud native challenges

28
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.000
focusing on AWS Lambda as a serverless technology.
