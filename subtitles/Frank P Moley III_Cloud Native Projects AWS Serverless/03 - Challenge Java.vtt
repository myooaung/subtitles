00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.007
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.000
- [Instructor] So now it's time for you to do

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.008
a challenge exercise using Java.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.007
We're going to actually use the same program

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.007
that we used before

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.003
but we're going to use request response with this one,

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.002
so we still need to go ahead and create objects.

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.001
Again, the idea here is just to play with the technology

9
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.007
not to get too deep into all of the various triggers

10
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.002
that you can execute.

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.002
However, if you do want to use a trigger,

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.001
this would be a great time to use something

13
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.004
like SQS that can send a triggered event

14
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.000
to your application.

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.006
I highly encourage you to play with that

16
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.006
if you choose to.

17
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.001
So a refresher on our steps.

18
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.007
You're going to create a Java program

19
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.007
using Maven or Gradle.

20
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.006
That link that I provided earlier has both options.

21
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.009
It's going to be our simple coin flip program.

22
00:00:54.009 --> 00:01:00.005
You input the number of flips to execute in your request.

23
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.000
You will randomize your results

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.006
or use a random function to do heads and tails.

25
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.003
And then I want you to output the number of flips

26
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.005
that you executed as well as the results

27
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.000
in heads and tails, just like we did before.

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.004
So now you're on your own.

29
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.000
Have fun with this one.
