00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:05.006
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.000
- [Instructor] Now it's time for another challenge exercise

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.004
and this one is the last one for the course.

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:11.009
We're going to mix it up a little bit

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.007
and instead of doing our coin toss,

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.004
we'll do a different interview type question.

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.002
This time it's going to be FizzBuzz.

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.008
Now the steps to do this.

9
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.006
You're going to create a FizzBuzz program.

10
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.006
You're going to pass in as a request parameter

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.003
the highest number to test.

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.008
You will then start at zero and iterate over that list,

13
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.003
and every time you find a number that is divisible by three,

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.004
I want you to print "Fizz".

15
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:41.008
Every time you find a number that is divisible by five,

16
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.009
I want you to print "Buzz".

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.006
Otherwise, you're just going to print the number.

18
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.004
Now if it's divisible by three and five,

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.000
it's FizzBuzz.

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.007
At the end of your program,

21
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.003
I want you to return a response element,

22
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.005
and the response element is going to output

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.004
the number of fizzes, the number of buzzes,

24
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.004
and the number of FizzBuzzes

25
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.009
based on the number that was passed in the beginning.

26
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.003
Now if you really want to have some fun with this one,

27
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:13.002
you can actually connect it to an RDS type database

28
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.002
and actually have your lambda spit the data out

29
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:21.003
into RDS instead of into lugs or some other format.

30
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:22.003
It's just an idea.

31
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.000
You could do the same thing with S3, create a file,

32
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.006
push it to S3.

33
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.005
Again, it's just finding different ways

34
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.003
to make this course a little bit more real world

35
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.008
for what you'll do.

36
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:36.000
I actually have many examples of the S3 one,

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.002
so that may be an easy way to go,

38
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.009
and a great opportunity to play with S3,

39
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.005
and you're not going to spend any money,

40
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:47.000
because S3 is relatively inexpensive even in large scale.
