00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] There's some initial setup on your machine

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:06.004
that is needed in order to be successful in this course.

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.001
First and foremost, let's talk about the language support

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.007
that we're going to use throughout this course.

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.005
All of these are OS-dependent installations.

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.004
And in order to install them on your machine,

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.005
whether it's Linux or Windows,

8
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.009
you're going to want to consult the documentation

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.006
of that language for your operating system.

10
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.002
We're going to use Java, the JDK.

11
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.007
I'm specifically going to use 14,

12
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:33.003
any of them after 11 should work for this course.

13
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.002
And you're also going to need Maven

14
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.000
to handle some dependency management,

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.003
because that's how I'm going to set up the project.

16
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.002
We're also going to use Golang.

17
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.003
I'm going to be using 1.14,

18
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.005
but you can use any modern version of Go

19
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.001
that is compatible with AWS Lambda.

20
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.004
And finally, we're going to use Python.

21
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.006
I'm going to use the 3.8 Interpreter.

22
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.009
Use any of the dot versions of Python 3

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.008
that you wish to use with AWS Lambda.

24
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.006
Again, ensure that there is support within AWS,

25
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.007
but they're all going to be specific to your operating system,

26
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.009
so pay attention to that.

27
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.009
Now, an IDE is something that many developers use

28
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.006
on any given day.

29
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.009
And while I'm going to use very specific IDEs,

30
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.001
the IDE itself is not important,

31
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.005
and I don't want you to get mired

32
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.001
in the IDE selection itself.

33
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.007
You really should use an IDE that is comfortable for you.

34
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.005
And that really brings us to the point of knowing your IDE.

35
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.003
Whether it's within this course

36
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.008
or anything within development,

37
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.001
understanding your IDE is critical

38
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.001
to making you most performant

39
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.002
in your day-to-day activities.

40
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.004
So, if you choose to use any IDE

41
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.001
other than the one I'm using,

42
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.006
that's perfectly fine,

43
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.003
and that's what you should do,

44
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.002
especially if it's an IDE that you know.

45
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, I'm going to recommend that you use

46
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.009
language-specific IDEs or plugins,

47
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.009
so when we're doing Java work,

48
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.002
choose an IDE that is specifically for Java

49
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.002
or has a plugin for that,

50
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.005
the same way with Go or Python.

51
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.009
Now, I'm going to reiterate this,

52
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.003
because oftentimes, this gets confusing to people.

53
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:12.007
I'm going to be using JetBrain's products.

54
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:16.006
What is important is that you are familiar with your IDE,

55
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:19.008
not that you're using the same one that I'm using.

56
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.006
Familiarity with the IDE is the most important aspect

57
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.003
of choosing an IDE,

58
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:27.005
for not only success in this course,

59
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.008
but your day-to-day activities.

60
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.009
Now, we will be using the command line,

61
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.005
and you need to understand the command line

62
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.002
for your operating system.

63
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.006
Now, understanding command line is very important

64
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:42.004
to being successful as a developer, in my opinion.

65
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:46.008
I use Mac OS 10, and as such I often use the Z shell

66
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.006
within Mac OS 10 to do operations.

67
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.003
Now, you may not have Z shell,

68
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.003
you may be using Bash in Linux.

69
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:54.006
That's perfectly fine,

70
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.009
as long as you know your command line.

71
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.006
And the same will transpire for Windows.

72
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:02.005
It's command line has options to either use Bash

73
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:04.005
if you're on Windows 10 Pro,

74
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.008
or other command line technology

75
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.008
that will allow you to accomplish the same things.

76
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:11.005
Now, if you're in a Windows environment,

77
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:15.002
you may have to look some stuff up on the Amazon website.

78
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:18.006
But what is important is that you know your command line

79
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.008
for your operating system.

80
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:22.008
Now, again, if you are on Windows,

81
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:25.008
you may need a little bit more in-depth knowledge

82
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:27.008
when targeting Linux backends,

83
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.009
and oftentimes, when you package your Lambda for AWS,

84
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.004
this becomes critical.

85
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.006
The good thing is AWS has provided

86
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.003
a lot of the documentation,

87
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.003
and much of it can be found very easily

88
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:42.000
with how to use Windows

89
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.009
and install to a Linux backend through AWS.

90
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.008
And you're going to need to know your toolkits,

91
00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:50.006
specifically the AWS CLI,

92
00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:52.005
that is a Python program

93
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:55.005
that runs on your operating system.

94
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:57.002
Now, AWS itself.

95
00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.004
We're going to be using Amazon Web Services

96
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:03.004
and Lambda functionality in order to use this course.

97
00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:06.001
First and foremost, you're going to need an account.

98
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.006
The good thing is, you can get an account for free,

99
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:10.007
and all of the examples that we're going to do

100
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:13.006
within this course should be able to leverage

101
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:15.006
a free account.

102
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:18.009
Now, you will need to know the basics of AWS.

103
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.007
You don't need a lot of in-depth knowledge,

104
00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:22.009
but you need to know how to get around in the console

105
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.005
and understand some of the various parts

106
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.002
that we're going to target.

107
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:29.004
More importantly than knowing AWS,

108
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:32.001
is be able to read their documentation.

109
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:35.007
AWS has compiled an amazing set of documentation,

110
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:38.006
and I'm going to encourage you to leverage often,

111
00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:40.000
if you get a little bit confused

112
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.002
about the direction that we're going

113
00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:44.000
with AWS Lambda.
