00:00:01.167  -->  00:00:02.000
<v Jonas>In this lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.000  -->  00:00:04.702
we will continue to build our project,
3

3

00:00:04.702  -->  00:00:07.202
and developing the game logic.
4

4

00:00:09.267  -->  00:00:11.933
So, in this lecture, you will find out
5

5

00:00:11.933  -->  00:00:15.256
what the ternary operator is, and you will learn
6

6

00:00:15.256  -->  00:00:18.923
how to add, remove, and toggle HTML classes.
7

7

00:00:21.125  -->  00:00:24.460
All right, so, we are still in the event listener,
8

8

00:00:24.460  -->  00:00:27.545
which controls what happens when a user clicks
9

9

00:00:27.545  -->  00:00:30.894
on the roll button here, right?
10

10

00:00:30.894  -->  00:00:34.764
And so, we already calculate our random dice number,
11

11

00:00:34.764  -->  00:00:38.258
and we also already displayed the corresponding dice number
12

12

00:00:38.258  -->  00:00:40.556
in the middle of our user interface.
13

13

00:00:40.556  -->  00:00:44.211
So now we need to continue developing our game logic here
14

14

00:00:44.211  -->  00:00:48.260
according to the number that your user rolls.
15

15

00:00:48.260  -->  00:00:51.545
So if the user rolls a number different from one,
16

16

00:00:51.545  -->  00:00:55.110
then the score gets added to his round score,
17

17

00:00:55.110  -->  00:00:57.150
and he can continue to play.
18

18

00:00:57.150  -->  00:00:59.496
And, otherwise, if he rolls a one,
19

19

00:00:59.496  -->  00:01:01.626
then it's the next player's turn.
20

20

00:01:01.626  -->  00:01:05.831
So, let's do that, using an if statement, right?
21

21

00:01:05.831  -->  00:01:07.081
So, if the dice
22

22

00:01:08.786  -->  00:01:12.036
is greater than one, then add to score,
23

23

00:01:15.044  -->  00:01:16.211
so, Add score,
24

24

00:01:18.060  -->  00:01:18.977
and if not,
25

25

00:01:21.322  -->  00:01:23.489
then it's the next player.
26

26

00:01:25.168  -->  00:01:27.029
And I really like to do it this way,
27

27

00:01:27.029  -->  00:01:29.473
so, write our if statement first,
28

28

00:01:29.473  -->  00:01:33.329
and then add a comment telling what I'm going to do.
29

29

00:01:33.329  -->  00:01:35.397
So here, I said that the dice number
30

30

00:01:35.397  -->  00:01:39.086
should be greater than one, but I could also have said
31

31

00:01:39.086  -->  00:01:41.785
simply that the dice would be different from one.
32

32

00:01:41.785  -->  00:01:44.261
And since we already know this one here,
33

33

00:01:44.261  -->  00:01:47.300
I'm going to show you the difference operator,
34

34

00:01:47.300  -->  00:01:50.170
which is simply this exclamation point,
35

35

00:01:50.170  -->  00:01:52.380
and then, equal, equal.
36

36

00:01:52.380  -->  00:01:55.279
And this is the one that doesn't do type coercion.
37

37

00:01:55.279  -->  00:01:58.368
So, remember, the equality operator,
38

38

00:01:58.368  -->  00:02:00.843
we have the triple equal,
39

39

00:02:00.843  -->  00:02:03.177
and this one doesn't do type coercion,
40

40

00:02:03.177  -->  00:02:05.485
while the double equal does type coercion.
41

41

00:02:05.485  -->  00:02:08.706
And it's the same for the different operator.
42

42

00:02:08.706  -->  00:02:12.143
So we have this one, which performs type coercion,
43

43

00:02:12.143  -->  00:02:14.804
while this one with the extra equal,
44

44

00:02:14.804  -->  00:02:17.623
which does not perform type coercion.
45

45

00:02:17.623  -->  00:02:20.400
So we always want to use this one.
46

46

00:02:20.400  -->  00:02:22.690
All right, so, let's add the dice result
47

47

00:02:22.690  -->  00:02:24.899
to our round score.
48

48

00:02:24.899  -->  00:02:26.732
So we have roundScore,
49

49

00:02:28.429  -->  00:02:29.822
and now, I'm gonna use the operator
50

50

00:02:29.822  -->  00:02:32.199
that I showed you in the introductory lectures,
51

51

00:02:32.199  -->  00:02:34.949
which is the plus equal operator.
52

52

00:02:36.088  -->  00:02:39.005
And now, I can simply add the dice.
53

53

00:02:40.764  -->  00:02:41.741
Right?
54

54

00:02:41.741  -->  00:02:45.239
So, once again, this would be the same as writing
55

55

00:02:45.239  -->  00:02:46.572
roundScore equal
56

56

00:02:47.875  -->  00:02:51.625
the current round score number plus the dice.
57

57

00:02:52.611  -->  00:02:54.981
But this here is much simpler and cleaner,
58

58

00:02:54.981  -->  00:02:57.481
so that's how we do it, right?
59

59

00:02:58.440  -->  00:03:01.110
And, again, we can use the roundScore variable
60

60

00:03:01.110  -->  00:03:02.965
right here in this function,
61

61

00:03:02.965  -->  00:03:05.933
because it was defined here in the global scope,
62

62

00:03:05.933  -->  00:03:07.899
and therefore, due to the scope chain,
63

63

00:03:07.899  -->  00:03:11.823
we have access to that variable in here.
64

64

00:03:11.823  -->  00:03:14.778
So we updated our internal variable value,
65

65

00:03:14.778  -->  00:03:18.995
but we also want to display it in the user interface, right?
66

66

00:03:18.995  -->  00:03:21.657
And we actually already did that down here,
67

67

00:03:21.657  -->  00:03:25.824
which I deleted, but we can get it back from here, right?
68

68

00:03:27.362  -->  00:03:29.827
Because you already know how to do this.
69

69

00:03:29.827  -->  00:03:32.082
So, remember this trick here
70

70

00:03:32.082  -->  00:03:34.463
that works with the active player.
71

71

00:03:34.463  -->  00:03:36.947
So if the active is player is the number zero,
72

72

00:03:36.947  -->  00:03:39.667
then the current-0 element
73

73

00:03:39.667  -->  00:03:42.299
will get the textContent, and if it's player one,
74

74

00:03:42.299  -->  00:03:45.723
then the current-1 element gets the content.
75

75

00:03:45.723  -->  00:03:48.947
And the content that we want is, of course,
76

76

00:03:48.947  -->  00:03:51.445
the round score, right?
77

77

00:03:51.445  -->  00:03:55.130
So, each time after the player rolls the dice,
78

78

00:03:55.130  -->  00:03:57.851
we want to first update the round score,
79

79

00:03:57.851  -->  00:04:01.241
and then display the round score in our user interface,
80

80

00:04:01.241  -->  00:04:05.941
and that happens in this element with this class.
81

81

00:04:05.941  -->  00:04:09.439
Okay, so let's quickly see this in action.
82

82

00:04:09.439  -->  00:04:13.080
So I'm refreshing, and I'll roll the dice.
83

83

00:04:13.080  -->  00:04:14.598
So this is adding here, because I have
84

84

00:04:14.598  -->  00:04:18.003
the active player as one, right?
85

85

00:04:18.003  -->  00:04:20.554
So, let's quickly change that, because the default
86

86

00:04:20.554  -->  00:04:22.632
will always be that the first player begins,
87

87

00:04:22.632  -->  00:04:24.504
so, player zero.
88

88

00:04:24.504  -->  00:04:27.203
So, refreshing this, now, roll the dice.
89

89

00:04:27.203  -->  00:04:29.453
So, five plus four is nine,
90

90

00:04:30.912  -->  00:04:32.162
plus two is 11,
91

91

00:04:33.657  -->  00:04:36.733
plus six is 17, and so, yeah, this is working.
92

92

00:04:36.733  -->  00:04:39.650
So let's see if we can catch a one.
93

93

00:04:40.730  -->  00:04:41.563
So, 34,
94

94

00:04:42.579  -->  00:04:43.412
36,
95

95

00:04:45.481  -->  00:04:48.375
all right, so, here's the one.
96

96

00:04:48.375  -->  00:04:52.398
So this time, we didn't add the one here.
97

97

00:04:52.398  -->  00:04:53.858
Now, what we want to happen
98

98

00:04:53.858  -->  00:04:57.335
is that now is the turn of player two, right?
99

99

00:04:57.335  -->  00:04:59.335
So let's implement that.
100

100

00:05:00.966  -->  00:05:02.545
And we are going to do that here.
101

101

00:05:02.545  -->  00:05:05.901
So if the player does something that is equal to ones,
102

102

00:05:05.901  -->  00:05:07.650
then we want the next player.
103

103

00:05:07.650  -->  00:05:10.492
So the first thing that makes sense to do now
104

104

00:05:10.492  -->  00:05:13.180
is to change this variable here, right?
105

105

00:05:13.180  -->  00:05:16.976
So, activePlayer will change from zero to one.
106

106

00:05:16.976  -->  00:05:17.995
And how do we do that?
107

107

00:05:17.995  -->  00:05:21.362
So, if it's zero, then we want one,
108

108

00:05:21.362  -->  00:05:23.673
and if it's one, we want zero.
109

109

00:05:23.673  -->  00:05:27.463
So it makes sense to use an if statement here, right?
110

110

00:05:27.463  -->  00:05:29.602
Actually, we can use something else,
111

111

00:05:29.602  -->  00:05:33.399
which is still an if, but it's an easier way to write it.
112

112

00:05:33.399  -->  00:05:36.113
And that's called the ternary operator,
113

113

00:05:36.113  -->  00:05:38.675
and it simply works like this.
114

114

00:05:38.675  -->  00:05:42.632
So, the activePlayer is what we want to test,
115

115

00:05:42.632  -->  00:05:45.804
so we still have our test condition here.
116

116

00:05:45.804  -->  00:05:47.137
So if it's zero,
117

117

00:05:48.475  -->  00:05:49.308
then
118

118

00:05:51.560  -->  00:05:53.810
activePlayer should be one.
119

119

00:05:56.367  -->  00:05:57.200
Else,
120

120

00:05:59.140  -->  00:06:00.140
activePlayer
121

121

00:06:01.691  -->  00:06:02.941
should be zero.
122

122

00:06:04.006  -->  00:06:04.863
Okay?
123

123

00:06:04.863  -->  00:06:06.282
So this is the exact same thing
124

124

00:06:06.282  -->  00:06:07.365
as writing if
125

125

00:06:09.417  -->  00:06:11.500
activePlayer equals zero,
126

126

00:06:13.001  -->  00:06:14.834
then activePlayer one,
127

127

00:06:18.250  -->  00:06:19.083
else,
128

128

00:06:20.572  -->  00:06:22.072
activePlayer zero.
129

129

00:06:23.219  -->  00:06:24.052
Okay?
130

130

00:06:24.052  -->  00:06:27.207
But this is much cleaner and much simpler, right?
131

131

00:06:27.207  -->  00:06:31.374
So for a very simple if statement such as this one,
132

132

00:06:32.449  -->  00:06:36.141
I like to use the ternary operator instead.
133

133

00:06:36.141  -->  00:06:39.578
Okay, so let's see what happens then,
134

134

00:06:39.578  -->  00:06:40.828
with the score.
135

135

00:06:44.538  -->  00:06:46.909
So we need to catch a one here.
136

136

00:06:46.909  -->  00:06:48.700
All right, so, now we have a one.
137

137

00:06:48.700  -->  00:06:50.506
And now, we should continue on this side, right?
138

138

00:06:50.506  -->  00:06:53.130
Because now it's player two.
139

139

00:06:53.130  -->  00:06:55.574
Okay, and so now we have a score here.
140

140

00:06:55.574  -->  00:06:59.437
But, the thing is that, we didn't restart at zero, right?
141

141

00:06:59.437  -->  00:07:01.243
We still continued with this 17.
142

142

00:07:01.243  -->  00:07:03.243
So 17 plus six makes 23.
143

143

00:07:04.514  -->  00:07:06.899
But we, of course, want to start this player
144

144

00:07:06.899  -->  00:07:09.643
(chuckles) at zero as well, right?
145

145

00:07:09.643  -->  00:07:12.130
So there's something else that we need to do here,
146

146

00:07:12.130  -->  00:07:15.880
which is to set the round score back to zero.
147

147

00:07:21.238  -->  00:07:24.420
Okay, so, when one player rolls a one,
148

148

00:07:24.420  -->  00:07:27.232
then the other player becomes the active player,
149

149

00:07:27.232  -->  00:07:30.983
and the round score is reset to zero.
150

150

00:07:30.983  -->  00:07:33.483
And now it should work, right?
151

151

00:07:37.219  -->  00:07:41.111
So, and now, it should go to the other player.
152

152

00:07:41.111  -->  00:07:44.101
All right, so, three, and one again,
153

153

00:07:44.101  -->  00:07:46.937
so now it's this player's turn again.
154

154

00:07:46.937  -->  00:07:50.270
And the right, we start from zero again,
155

155

00:07:51.660  -->  00:07:54.722
and the game keeps working.
156

156

00:07:54.722  -->  00:07:56.533
Now, there's still a couple of things
157

157

00:07:56.533  -->  00:07:58.605
that we need to do here, right?
158

158

00:07:58.605  -->  00:08:00.507
Because, as we know from the rules,
159

159

00:08:00.507  -->  00:08:02.254
as soon as a player rolls a one,
160

160

00:08:02.254  -->  00:08:06.337
he loses this score, so it should be set to zero.
161

161

00:08:07.248  -->  00:08:10.506
So it should not be set only to zero here,
162

162

00:08:10.506  -->  00:08:12.787
but also in the user interface.
163

163

00:08:12.787  -->  00:08:16.287
So you need to do a couple of things here.
164

164

00:08:17.315  -->  00:08:19.148
So let's select these.
165

165

00:08:20.943  -->  00:08:23.276
So, current-1 and current-0.
166

166

00:08:25.428  -->  00:08:26.813
And, once again, we're going to use
167

167

00:08:26.813  -->  00:08:29.593
the getElementId method for that.
168

168

00:08:29.593  -->  00:08:31.926
So, document.getElementById,
169

169

00:08:34.989  -->  00:08:35.989
and now it's
170

170

00:08:37.067  -->  00:08:38.900
current-0.textContent.
171

171

00:08:44.718  -->  00:08:47.301
We want that to be set to zero,
172

172

00:08:48.442  -->  00:08:52.085
and the same thing, of course, for the number one.
173

173

00:08:52.085  -->  00:08:55.526
Okay, and, another thing that we should also do
174

174

00:08:55.526  -->  00:08:58.331
is to make it visible in the user interface
175

175

00:08:58.331  -->  00:09:00.414
who is the active player.
176

176

00:09:01.268  -->  00:09:06.227
So what I mean is this bold text here, and this red dot.
177

177

00:09:06.227  -->  00:09:08.734
And also, this gray background.
178

178

00:09:08.734  -->  00:09:11.685
So let me first show you in the HTML
179

179

00:09:11.685  -->  00:09:14.185
how that is actually achieved.
180

180

00:09:15.093  -->  00:09:17.688
So, in here, we have this active class
181

181

00:09:17.688  -->  00:09:20.874
on the player-0-panel that we do not have
182

182

00:09:20.874  -->  00:09:23.295
in the player-1-panel, right?
183

183

00:09:23.295  -->  00:09:26.546
So it's this class here that makes all the difference.
184

184

00:09:26.546  -->  00:09:30.713
Let me remove it from here to show you the difference.
185

185

00:09:32.119  -->  00:09:34.482
All right, and now, this is not active,
186

186

00:09:34.482  -->  00:09:37.076
so right now, player one looks exactly the same
187

187

00:09:37.076  -->  00:09:39.117
like player two, right?
188

188

00:09:39.117  -->  00:09:42.273
So, what we have to do is to,
189

189

00:09:42.273  -->  00:09:43.739
as soon as the player changes,
190

190

00:09:43.739  -->  00:09:45.705
we have to remove the active class
191

191

00:09:45.705  -->  00:09:47.687
from the player-0-panel
192

192

00:09:47.687  -->  00:09:50.437
and add it to the player-1-panel.
193

193

00:09:51.363  -->  00:09:54.095
And this is one of the really cool things
194

194

00:09:54.095  -->  00:09:57.465
that we can do in JavaScript to style our applications,
195

195

00:09:57.465  -->  00:10:00.356
is removing and adding classes like this,
196

196

00:10:00.356  -->  00:10:02.393
like we're going to do now.
197

197

00:10:02.393  -->  00:10:04.881
So we need to, as you already know by now,
198

198

00:10:04.881  -->  00:10:07.534
start by selecting the element that we want.
199

199

00:10:07.534  -->  00:10:09.784
So, document.querySelector,
200

200

00:10:11.980  -->  00:10:14.063
because it's now a class.
201

201

00:10:16.465  -->  00:10:19.632
So this one was called player-0-panel.
202

202

00:10:21.649  -->  00:10:24.232
And then we need the classList,
203

203

00:10:25.225  -->  00:10:27.132
and in here, we have a couple of methods
204

204

00:10:27.132  -->  00:10:30.209
to add, remove, and toggle classes.
205

205

00:10:30.209  -->  00:10:33.789
So let me first show you the remove one.
206

206

00:10:33.789  -->  00:10:35.175
Remove.
207

207

00:10:35.175  -->  00:10:36.656
And now, all we have to do
208

208

00:10:36.656  -->  00:10:39.088
is to pass in the name of the class
209

209

00:10:39.088  -->  00:10:41.749
that we want to remove, and it's as simple as that.
210

210

00:10:41.749  -->  00:10:45.499
So now, the active class will very simply get removed,
211

211

00:10:45.499  -->  00:10:48.347
and just, before reloading the page,
212

212

00:10:48.347  -->  00:10:49.514
let's then add
213

213

00:10:51.316  -->  00:10:53.688
a class to the other panel.
214

214

00:10:53.688  -->  00:10:55.021
A querySelector,
215

215

00:10:56.390  -->  00:10:57.973
and player-1-panel.
216

216

00:11:01.214  -->  00:11:04.674
And, once again, we, to use classList,
217

217

00:11:04.674  -->  00:11:07.298
and then, we can simply say add.
218

218

00:11:07.298  -->  00:11:10.717
And, once again, we need to specify the class
219

219

00:11:10.717  -->  00:11:12.145
that we want to add.
220

220

00:11:12.145  -->  00:11:13.978
So let's now see this.
221

221

00:11:16.867  -->  00:11:18.420
All right.
222

222

00:11:18.420  -->  00:11:21.140
So I'm waiting for the one.
223

223

00:11:21.140  -->  00:11:22.876
All right, so, here it is.
224

224

00:11:22.876  -->  00:11:26.188
So the active class was removed from here and added to here,
225

225

00:11:26.188  -->  00:11:29.925
and like this, we can now visibly see here
226

226

00:11:29.925  -->  00:11:32.681
that player two is now active.
227

227

00:11:32.681  -->  00:11:35.603
And the other change that we did before is also reflected,
228

228

00:11:35.603  -->  00:11:38.353
because this is now back to zero.
229

229

00:11:39.414  -->  00:11:41.042
Okay?
230

230

00:11:41.042  -->  00:11:44.119
But now you saw that I rolled a one before.
231

231

00:11:44.119  -->  00:11:46.180
I actually clicked a bit too fast here,
232

232

00:11:46.180  -->  00:11:48.598
but the player didn't change.
233

233

00:11:48.598  -->  00:11:50.902
And of course it didn't, because we didn't tell
234

234

00:11:50.902  -->  00:11:53.902
the code to do so, so let's go back.
235

235

00:11:54.870  -->  00:11:57.114
And one way that we could do this
236

236

00:11:57.114  -->  00:12:00.829
would be to say, all right, if the active player is zero,
237

237

00:12:00.829  -->  00:12:04.339
then do it like this, so, remove the class from zero,
238

238

00:12:04.339  -->  00:12:07.072
and add it to player one.
239

239

00:12:07.072  -->  00:12:09.040
But, there is a better way,
240

240

00:12:09.040  -->  00:12:12.124
because we not only have remove and add,
241

241

00:12:12.124  -->  00:12:14.587
but we also have something called toggle.
242

242

00:12:14.587  -->  00:12:18.009
And what toggle does is to add the class,
243

243

00:12:18.009  -->  00:12:21.228
if it's not there, and if it's there, to remove.
244

244

00:12:21.228  -->  00:12:25.551
So, in this case, if player zero has the class active,
245

245

00:12:25.551  -->  00:12:26.808
then it will remove it.
246

246

00:12:26.808  -->  00:12:30.585
And if it does not, then it will add it.
247

247

00:12:30.585  -->  00:12:33.294
All right, so, I will leave
248

248

00:12:33.294  -->  00:12:35.711
these here as your reference,
249

249

00:12:36.846  -->  00:12:38.513
okay, but I will now
250

250

00:12:40.082  -->  00:12:41.582
do it differently.
251

251

00:12:43.373  -->  00:12:44.206
Okay?
252

252

00:12:45.238  -->  00:12:49.608
So I don't want to remove, I want to toggle.
253

253

00:12:49.608  -->  00:12:51.691
And here, the same thing.
254

254

00:12:52.589  -->  00:12:54.839
And now it's going to work.
255

255

00:12:58.841  -->  00:12:59.886
All right.
256

256

00:12:59.886  -->  00:13:02.278
So it changed to player two,
257

257

00:13:02.278  -->  00:13:05.111
and is changed back to player one.
258

258

00:13:07.337  -->  00:13:08.170
All right.
259

259

00:13:10.800  -->  00:13:12.478
Okay, very nice.
260

260

00:13:12.478  -->  00:13:14.933
And now, one last thing that I want to do
261

261

00:13:14.933  -->  00:13:17.400
is to also, when a player rolls a one,
262

262

00:13:17.400  -->  00:13:19.598
to hide the dice again,
263

263

00:13:19.598  -->  00:13:21.441
so that when the next player's turn is,
264

264

00:13:21.441  -->  00:13:24.613
we don't have any dice here visible.
265

265

00:13:24.613  -->  00:13:27.807
And that's pretty easy, we already did that, right?
266

266

00:13:27.807  -->  00:13:30.208
But without looking at the code,
267

267

00:13:30.208  -->  00:13:33.625
we know that it's document.querySelector,
268

268

00:13:34.731  -->  00:13:37.422
and it's the dice class, actually,
269

269

00:13:37.422  -->  00:13:41.390
and then, we need style, and then, we just need
270

270

00:13:41.390  -->  00:13:44.498
the CSS property that we want to change.
271

271

00:13:44.498  -->  00:13:47.428
And this one is the display property,
272

272

00:13:47.428  -->  00:13:51.610
which we are setting to none, once again.
273

273

00:13:51.610  -->  00:13:52.443
All right.
274

274

00:13:54.639  -->  00:13:56.764
So let's reload this.
275

275

00:13:56.764  -->  00:13:58.059
All right.
276

276

00:13:58.059  -->  00:13:59.922
So, I rolled a one, but it disappeared,
277

277

00:13:59.922  -->  00:14:01.539
and now it's the next player,
278

278

00:14:01.539  -->  00:14:05.706
and he has, like, an empty spot here to roll his dice.
279

279

00:14:06.799  -->  00:14:09.292
Now, up until this point, we have no way
280

280

00:14:09.292  -->  00:14:12.537
to hold our points so that they get added up
281

281

00:14:12.537  -->  00:14:15.204
here in the global score, right?
282

282

00:14:15.204  -->  00:14:19.371
So that's what we're going to do right in the next lecture.
