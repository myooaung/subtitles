<v Narrator>So we've been throwing around words</v>
2

2

00:00:02.850  -->  00:00:05.760
like AJAX and API throughout this section,
3

3

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:08.180
but before we move on, let's just take a second
4

4

00:00:08.180  -->  00:00:11.510
to understand what these terms actually mean.
5

5

00:00:11.510  -->  00:00:15.560
So AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML.
6

6

00:00:15.560  -->  00:00:18.000
And basically, it allows us to asynchronously
7

7

00:00:18.000  -->  00:00:20.600
communicate with remote servers.
8

8

00:00:20.600  -->  00:00:23.030
So let's say we have our JavaScript app running
9

9

00:00:23.030  -->  00:00:25.480
in the browser, which is called the client.
10

10

00:00:25.480  -->  00:00:28.440
And we want the app to get some data from our server.
11

11

00:00:28.440  -->  00:00:31.750
But of course, without having to reload the entire page.
12

12

00:00:31.750  -->  00:00:35.810
Well, with AJAX we can do a simple get HTTP request,
13

13

00:00:35.810  -->  00:00:38.970
to our server, which will then send back a response
14

14

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:41.350
containing the data that we requested.
15

15

00:00:41.350  -->  00:00:43.999
And this all happens asynchronously in the background
16

16

00:00:43.999  -->  00:00:46.380
just the way we learned before.
17

17

00:00:46.380  -->  00:00:49.160
Also, of course, this not only works for getting data
18

18

00:00:49.160  -->  00:00:52.610
from the server, but also to send data to the server
19

19

00:00:52.610  -->  00:00:55.940
by doing a post request rather than a get request.
20

20

00:00:55.940  -->  00:00:58.400
Now, in practice, there are many ways in which
21

21

00:00:58.400  -->  00:01:00.450
we can do AJAX in Javascript.
22

22

00:01:00.450  -->  00:01:02.451
And we're gonna look at the fetch web API
23

23

00:01:02.451  -->  00:01:04.710
in the next lecture, which will allow us
24

24

00:01:04.710  -->  00:01:07.870
to make some AJAX calls in a very easy way.
25

25

00:01:07.870  -->  00:01:10.640
Alright, and since we were talking about servers,
26

26

00:01:10.640  -->  00:01:13.200
we also have to talk about APIs.
27

27

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:17.050
So, API stands for Application Programming Interface
28

28

00:01:17.050  -->  00:01:19.975
and on a very high level, it's basically a piece of software
29

29

00:01:19.975  -->  00:01:22.553
that can be used by another piece of software
30

30

00:01:22.553  -->  00:01:24.930
in order to basically allow applications
31

31

00:01:24.930  -->  00:01:26.580
to talk to each other.
32

32

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:30.070
And that's not just valid for web development in Javascript,
33

33

00:01:30.070  -->  00:01:32.340
but for programming in general, okay?
34

34

00:01:32.340  -->  00:01:34.800
But now, in reference to web development and AJAX
35

35

00:01:34.800  -->  00:01:38.755
and servers, well, the API is not the server itself,
36

36

00:01:38.755  -->  00:01:41.120
but it's like a part of the server.
37

37

00:01:41.120  -->  00:01:43.810
Like an application that receives requests
38

38

00:01:43.810  -->  00:01:46.030
and sends back responses.
39

39

00:01:46.030  -->  00:01:48.800
So let's distinguish between two types of APIs
40

40

00:01:48.800  -->  00:01:50.440
that you can use in Javascript.
41

41

00:01:50.440  -->  00:01:54.930
Which are your own APIs or external, third-party APIs.
42

42

00:01:54.930  -->  00:01:56.310
So let's imagine for a second,
43

43

00:01:56.310  -->  00:01:58.210
that you're building a traveling app.
44

44

00:01:58.210  -->  00:02:00.570
And you have the database with different destinations
45

45

00:02:00.570  -->  00:02:02.790
and tours that you're offering.
46

46

00:02:02.790  -->  00:02:05.780
So on your server, you could build your own API
47

47

00:02:05.780  -->  00:02:08.270
that can receive requests from your front end app
48

48

00:02:08.270  -->  00:02:11.280
in Javascript and send back the results.
49

49

00:02:11.280  -->  00:02:15.330
So that would be your own API hosted on your own server.
50

50

00:02:15.330  -->  00:02:18.160
But now, you also need some current weather information
51

51

00:02:18.160  -->  00:02:21.340
for each destination, which you don't have in your database.
52

52

00:02:21.340  -->  00:02:23.630
And so you can use a third party API
53

53

00:02:23.630  -->  00:02:25.960
to get that weather data, okay?
54

54

00:02:25.960  -->  00:02:27.390
That makes sense, right?
55

55

00:02:27.390  -->  00:02:28.880
And there are actually all kinds of
56

56

00:02:28.880  -->  00:02:30.700
third party APIs out there.
57

57

00:02:30.700  -->  00:02:32.960
Like to include Google Maps into your app,
58

58

00:02:32.960  -->  00:02:36.640
or to embed YouTube videos to get data about movies,
59

59

00:02:36.640  -->  00:02:40.460
or even to send emails or text messages from the Venmo app.
60

60

00:02:40.460  -->  00:02:43.614
There are really endless possibilities and that's why APIs
61

61

00:02:43.614  -->  00:02:47.319
are getting so popular in web development, okay?
62

62

00:02:47.319  -->  00:02:51.580
So, these are the very fundamentals about AJAX and APIs,
63

63

00:02:51.580  -->  00:02:54.870
but it's all you need to know in order to get started.
64

64

00:02:54.870  -->  00:02:57.893
So let's move on now, and use some AJAX in practice.
