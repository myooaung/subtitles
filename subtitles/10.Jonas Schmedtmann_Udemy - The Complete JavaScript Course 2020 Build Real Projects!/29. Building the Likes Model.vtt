00:00:01.100  -->  00:00:03.400
<v Instructor>Hey there, and welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.400  -->  00:00:05.378
Let's now build the last part of the app
3

3

00:00:05.378  -->  00:00:08.240
which is the likes, and we're going to start again
4

4

00:00:08.240  -->  00:00:09.943
with building the model.
5

5

00:00:10.950  -->  00:00:13.570
So let me start by showing you the functionality
6

6

00:00:13.570  -->  00:00:15.860
that we're actually trying to implement here.
7

7

00:00:15.860  -->  00:00:18.710
So I'm opening the final version here.
8

8

00:00:20.710  -->  00:00:22.060
Then let me search for pizza,
9

9

00:00:22.060  -->  00:00:23.893
open up the first result here.
10

10

00:00:25.200  -->  00:00:26.730
And it's not loading because it's the one
11

11

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:28.600
that's actually already loaded.
12

12

00:00:28.600  -->  00:00:30.120
So the next one.
13

13

00:00:30.120  -->  00:00:31.740
And so down here we have this heart,
14

14

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:33.210
and now we want to be able to actually
15

15

00:00:33.210  -->  00:00:34.750
click the heart.
16

16

00:00:34.750  -->  00:00:36.520
It then becomes selected,
17

17

00:00:36.520  -->  00:00:39.030
and it's added here to the list.
18

18

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:39.910
Okay.
19

19

00:00:39.910  -->  00:00:42.864
And if we move down to the next one,
20

20

00:00:42.864  -->  00:00:44.730
then we can like this one as well.
21

21

00:00:44.730  -->  00:00:46.320
And now we have both on the list.
22

22

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:48.260
And we come back to the first one,
23

23

00:00:48.260  -->  00:00:49.980
then the like should still be there,
24

24

00:00:49.980  -->  00:00:51.240
and indeed it is.
25

25

00:00:51.240  -->  00:00:53.304
And then we can add some more,
26

26

00:00:53.304  -->  00:00:55.758
and then the list then keeps growing and growing,
27

27

00:00:55.758  -->  00:00:59.040
adding all of our elements.
28

28

00:00:59.040  -->  00:00:59.873
Okay.
29

29

00:00:59.873  -->  00:01:01.100
If we then go back to this one,
30

30

00:01:01.100  -->  00:01:02.770
we can unlike, of course,
31

31

00:01:02.770  -->  00:01:04.670
and then it moves us out here off the list
32

32

00:01:04.670  -->  00:01:06.270
and it's no longer there, of course.
33

33

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:08.390
So that's what we're trying to implement here,
34

34

00:01:08.390  -->  00:01:10.240
and let's start again with the model.
35

35

00:01:11.870  -->  00:01:14.860
So I'm going to call this one here Likes.js.
36

36

00:01:14.860  -->  00:01:16.660
And now this point will actually be a bit similar
37

37

00:01:16.660  -->  00:01:18.800
to the list class.
38

38

00:01:18.800  -->  00:01:19.633
Okay.
39

39

00:01:19.633  -->  00:01:21.760
So we will have a list again, and in this list,
40

40

00:01:21.760  -->  00:01:24.190
instead of saving the ingredients as before,
41

41

00:01:24.190  -->  00:01:26.083
we are going to save the likes.
42

42

00:01:27.020  -->  00:01:28.350
So export default
43

43

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:32.660
class and Likes
44

44

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:37.288
or constructor, and again, we don't pass anything into it,
45

45

00:01:37.288  -->  00:01:40.710
but we initialize it with a empty array,
46

46

00:01:40.710  -->  00:01:42.833
which is going to be stored in this.likes.
47

47

00:01:44.720  -->  00:01:48.000
Okay, and so again, this is a bit similar to the list class,
48

48

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:50.940
and so we could do the sub-classing here.
49

49

00:01:50.940  -->  00:01:53.540
So just like I showed you in the ES6 section,
50

50

00:01:53.540  -->  00:01:56.090
where we can add subclasses to classes.
51

51

00:01:56.090  -->  00:01:58.620
But in this case I think it doesn't really make sense,
52

52

00:01:58.620  -->  00:02:02.420
because first they're actually not that similar,
53

53

00:02:02.420  -->  00:02:05.390
and also, they are semantically quite different.
54

54

00:02:05.390  -->  00:02:07.970
So a shopping list and a list of likes
55

55

00:02:07.970  -->  00:02:09.360
is quite a different thing.
56

56

00:02:09.360  -->  00:02:11.850
So it's not like, for example, a pizza recipe,
57

57

00:02:11.850  -->  00:02:14.070
which is still a subclass of recipe,
58

58

00:02:14.070  -->  00:02:16.030
so they are like related things.
59

59

00:02:16.030  -->  00:02:17.777
But a list of likes and a list of ingredients,
60

60

00:02:17.777  -->  00:02:20.710
well, they're kind of a different thing.
61

61

00:02:20.710  -->  00:02:21.580
Okay.
62

62

00:02:21.580  -->  00:02:26.170
Now, nonetheless, let's add the addLike method here.
63

63

00:02:26.170  -->  00:02:29.010
And so again, this is a bit similar to the list
64

64

00:02:29.010  -->  00:02:30.370
that we coded out before.
65

65

00:02:30.370  -->  00:02:33.750
Now at this time, we are going to pass in the ID,
66

66

00:02:33.750  -->  00:02:36.808
the title of the recipe, the author,
67

67

00:02:36.808  -->  00:02:38.565
and the image.
68

68

00:02:38.565  -->  00:02:39.398
Okay.
69

69

00:02:39.398  -->  00:02:41.122
And so that is the data that we need
70

70

00:02:41.122  -->  00:02:43.872
in order to display it like this.
71

71

00:02:45.371  -->  00:02:47.182
So, but we want it here in the list.
72

72

00:02:47.182  -->  00:02:48.899
We need the author, the image,
73

73

00:02:48.899  -->  00:02:50.270
the title of the recipe, of course,
74

74

00:02:50.270  -->  00:02:53.093
and then the ID so that we can then open it up
75

75

00:02:53.093  -->  00:02:54.060
like this.
76

76

00:02:54.060  -->  00:02:55.920
So we need always to have this ID
77

77

00:02:55.920  -->  00:02:58.480
so that we can call this URL, okay?
78

78

00:02:58.480  -->  00:03:00.520
And so that's the data that we need to save here
79

79

00:03:00.520  -->  00:03:01.850
in each individual like,
80

80

00:03:01.850  -->  00:03:04.840
so ID, title, author, and image.
81

81

00:03:04.840  -->  00:03:07.493
So let's create a like object,
82

82

00:03:09.210  -->  00:03:10.830
and an object that will contain
83

83

00:03:10.830  -->  00:03:12.560
simply all of these elements.
84

84

00:03:12.560  -->  00:03:17.560
So ID, title, author, and the image.
85

85

00:03:17.950  -->  00:03:20.610
And then we will then push it to the likes array.
86

86

00:03:20.610  -->  00:03:24.273
So this.likes.push.
87

87

00:03:28.305  -->  00:03:29.640
Okay, and then just like before,
88

88

00:03:29.640  -->  00:03:33.460
we are also going to return the newly created like.
89

89

00:03:33.460  -->  00:03:37.900
Okay, and now we have to delete like also,
90

90

00:03:37.900  -->  00:03:39.960
which needs as an input the ID,
91

91

00:03:39.960  -->  00:03:42.560
and so this one's actually quite the same as before.
92

92

00:03:42.560  -->  00:03:44.340
So let's actually go ahead and save us some time here,
93

93

00:03:44.340  -->  00:03:45.433
go to the list,
94

94

00:03:46.650  -->  00:03:48.483
copy all of this here,
95

95

00:03:51.140  -->  00:03:53.083
and get rid of this here.
96

96

00:03:55.410  -->  00:03:56.760
And so all we have to change really here
97

97

00:03:56.760  -->  00:03:59.890
is change it from items to likes.
98

98

00:03:59.890  -->  00:04:01.970
Okay, and then it's going to work in the exact same way.
99

99

00:04:01.970  -->  00:04:04.830
So we pass in an ID, then we find the index
100

100

00:04:04.830  -->  00:04:07.360
off that ID, and then remove the element
101

101

00:04:07.360  -->  00:04:08.880
corresponding to that ID
102

102

00:04:08.880  -->  00:04:12.040
from the likes array using the splice method.
103

103

00:04:12.040  -->  00:04:14.560
Okay, so that's exactly the same as before.
104

104

00:04:14.560  -->  00:04:16.740
Now we also need another method here,
105

105

00:04:16.740  -->  00:04:18.850
which is the isLiked.
106

106

00:04:18.850  -->  00:04:20.790
Okay, and again, we're passing in an ID,
107

107

00:04:20.790  -->  00:04:22.550
and this method here is basically to test
108

108

00:04:22.550  -->  00:04:24.780
if we have a like in our array here,
109

109

00:04:24.780  -->  00:04:26.696
which has the ID that we pass in.
110

110

00:04:26.696  -->  00:04:28.160
And this one is going to be important
111

111

00:04:28.160  -->  00:04:30.200
for this functionality here.
112

112

00:04:30.200  -->  00:04:32.640
So where we want to display this button here
113

113

00:04:32.640  -->  00:04:34.070
as either liked or not liked,
114

114

00:04:34.070  -->  00:04:36.770
so we have to know when we load a recipe
115

115

00:04:36.770  -->  00:04:38.680
if it's a liked recipe or if it's not
116

116

00:04:38.680  -->  00:04:40.910
in order to then accordingly style this button.
117

117

00:04:40.910  -->  00:04:42.828
But you're going to see why a bit better
118

118

00:04:42.828  -->  00:04:46.100
when we start coding the controller in the view.
119

119

00:04:46.100  -->  00:04:47.640
So how can we do this?
120

120

00:04:47.640  -->  00:04:51.070
Well, we just need to try to find the index of the ID,
121

121

00:04:51.070  -->  00:04:53.770
so in a very similar way to up here, again,
122

122

00:04:53.770  -->  00:04:56.300
and then see if it is different to minus one.
123

123

00:04:56.300  -->  00:04:57.920
Because if the index is minus one,
124

124

00:04:57.920  -->  00:05:00.100
it means that it is not there.
125

125

00:05:00.100  -->  00:05:02.610
So what we're going to return is
126

126

00:05:02.610  -->  00:05:04.727
this.likes
127

127

00:05:04.727  -->  00:05:05.560
.findIndex,
128

128

00:05:11.910  -->  00:05:13.530
and then find the index, of course,
129

129

00:05:13.530  -->  00:05:17.710
where the passed ID is equal to the current ID
130

130

00:05:17.710  -->  00:05:19.110
in the current loop.
131

131

00:05:19.110  -->  00:05:19.980
Okay.
132

132

00:05:19.980  -->  00:05:22.950
And we will then test if this is different
133

133

00:05:22.950  -->  00:05:24.300
than minus one.
134

134

00:05:24.300  -->  00:05:26.974
Okay, and that's because if we cannot find any item
135

135

00:05:26.974  -->  00:05:28.950
with the ID that we passed in,
136

136

00:05:28.950  -->  00:05:31.510
then this will be minus one, okay,
137

137

00:05:31.510  -->  00:05:32.720
and if this is minus one,
138

138

00:05:32.720  -->  00:05:34.320
well then this entire expression here
139

139

00:05:34.320  -->  00:05:37.010
will turn out to be false, which is what we want,
140

140

00:05:37.010  -->  00:05:39.170
because it means that the recipe with the ID
141

141

00:05:39.170  -->  00:05:41.470
that was passed in is not liked.
142

142

00:05:41.470  -->  00:05:44.610
Now on the other hand, if this turns out a number
143

143

00:05:44.610  -->  00:05:46.700
that is not minus one, well then this here
144

144

00:05:46.700  -->  00:05:49.567
will of course be true, and we will then return true
145

145

00:05:49.567  -->  00:05:52.580
because the recipe with the ID that we passed in
146

146

00:05:52.580  -->  00:05:53.890
is, of course, liked.
147

147

00:05:53.890  -->  00:05:56.348
So it is basically here in this array.
148

148

00:05:56.348  -->  00:05:57.938
All right.
149

149

00:05:57.938  -->  00:06:00.180
So that's the isLiked method,
150

150

00:06:00.180  -->  00:06:03.350
and now we also need a very simple method called
151

151

00:06:03.350  -->  00:06:04.993
get the number of likes.
152

152

00:06:08.080  -->  00:06:12.023
Okay, so this one just returns this.likes.length.
153

153

00:06:13.920  -->  00:06:16.810
And okay, so this should be enough for the model for now.
154

154

00:06:16.810  -->  00:06:18.128
We will add some more stuff a bit later,
155

155

00:06:18.128  -->  00:06:21.170
but for now it works fine just like this.
156

156

00:06:21.170  -->  00:06:23.930
And I think we don't really have to test this here
157

157

00:06:23.930  -->  00:06:26.570
now in the console, because it's so similar to
158

158

00:06:26.570  -->  00:06:28.520
the list model which is already working,
159

159

00:06:28.520  -->  00:06:30.130
and so the likes should be working as well.
160

160

00:06:30.130  -->  00:06:32.398
And if not, well, we're going to find the error then
161

161

00:06:32.398  -->  00:06:34.230
in a second in the next video
162

162

00:06:34.230  -->  00:06:36.700
when we will start coding out the controller
163

163

00:06:36.700  -->  00:06:37.693
for this.likes.
