1

00:00:01,410  -->  00:00:03,212
<v Instructor>Let's now finally render the recipe</v>
2

2

00:00:03,212  -->  00:00:05,363
in the user interface.
3

3

00:00:06,230  -->  00:00:10,260
And so that starts by creating a new Views file here.
4

4

00:00:10,260  -->  00:00:15,260
So RecipeView.js
5

5

00:00:15,260  -->  00:00:18,483
and then also right away import it here.
6

6

00:00:19,760  -->  00:00:22,570
Okay, now simply duplicating this line here
7

7

00:00:22,570  -->  00:00:25,523
and replacing Search with Recipe.
8

8

00:00:26,440  -->  00:00:29,070
Okay, so again, we're going to import everything
9

9

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:31,906
into Recipe and then use these different functions
10

10

00:00:31,906  -->  00:00:36,540
as like methods on this recipeView object.
11

11

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:39,290
Okay, so the most important function that we want
12

12

00:00:39,290  -->  00:00:43,830
in recipeView here is to, of course, render the recipe.
13

13

00:00:43,830  -->  00:00:48,693
So export and render recipe.
14

14

00:00:50,690  -->  00:00:54,900
Where we put in, and I forgot of course the equal sign.
15

15

00:00:54,900  -->  00:00:56,693
So we put in the recipe.
16

16

00:00:59,984  -->  00:01:03,760
And then we render the markup that we want to create here.
17

17

00:01:03,760  -->  00:01:07,743
So, just like before, we create a variable called markup.
18

18

00:01:11,300  -->  00:01:13,963
And give ourselves a nice template string.
19

19

00:01:15,440  -->  00:01:16,790
This here should be markup.
20

20

00:01:18,850  -->  00:01:22,620
And now let's actually get our H.T.M.L. code here.
21

21

00:01:22,620  -->  00:01:25,790
So we have an element called recipe already in our dumb.
22

22

00:01:25,790  -->  00:01:29,370
And what we're gonna insert in here is basically all
23

23

00:01:29,370  -->  00:01:31,030
of this H.T.M.L. code here.
24

24

00:01:31,030  -->  00:01:32,320
So all of this.
25

25

00:01:32,320  -->  00:01:33,623
So let's grab it.
26

26

00:01:35,233  -->  00:01:36,453
And that was too much.
27

27

00:01:40,420  -->  00:01:42,923
So that is our H.T.M.L.
28

28

00:01:44,339  -->  00:01:48,420
So let's get ahead and paste it here.
29

29

00:01:48,420  -->  00:01:50,470
Whoa, what's going on here?
30

30

00:01:50,470  -->  00:01:52,253
That doesn't look correct at all.
31

31

00:01:59,010  -->  00:02:02,410
Okay, so that is a lot of code and it looks quite confusing.
32

32

00:02:02,410  -->  00:02:06,680
So let's figure out what exactly we have to replace here.
33

33

00:02:06,680  -->  00:02:08,900
So first off, we have the image here.
34

34

00:02:08,900  -->  00:02:10,190
And so that's the first thing
35

35

00:02:10,190  -->  00:02:11,693
that we're gonna wanna replace.
36

36

00:02:13,270  -->  00:02:17,200
And so remember, we paste in recipe and the recipe is,
37

37

00:02:17,200  -->  00:02:19,210
obviously, the recipe object.
38

38

00:02:19,210  -->  00:02:22,120
And so in there we have the property called I.M.G.
39

39

00:02:22,120  -->  00:02:25,770
And so that's where the U.R.L. alt image is stored.
40

40

00:02:25,770  -->  00:02:30,770
So image then as an alt text, let's just use the title.
41

41

00:02:30,870  -->  00:02:35,167
So recipe.title, okay.
42

42

00:02:35,167  -->  00:02:38,720
And now I'm actually gonna go and copy this one here
43

43

00:02:38,720  -->  00:02:40,270
because it's really always the same.
44

44

00:02:40,270  -->  00:02:43,703
Then in here we also have the title, okay.
45

45

00:02:44,992  -->  00:02:47,600
Then down here, let's create some space here.
46

46

00:02:47,600  -->  00:02:49,290
We have the recipe details.
47

47

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:52,040
So we start with the time and so in here
48

48

00:02:52,040  -->  00:02:53,360
we want the recipe time.
49

49

00:02:53,360  -->  00:02:57,470
So instead of 45, it's the custom time.
50

50

00:02:57,470  -->  00:02:59,680
Then here it is the servings.
51

51

00:02:59,680  -->  00:03:03,283
So four servings and now it is recipe.servings.
52

52

00:03:04,423  -->  00:03:06,602
Let's take a look if that's correct.
53

53

00:03:06,602  -->  00:03:10,993
So we have time and servings.
54

54

00:03:12,000  -->  00:03:12,833
Right.
55

55

00:03:13,870  -->  00:03:18,180
Down here we don't really have anything important for now.
56

56

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:20,310
And then next up, we have the ingredients.
57

57

00:03:20,310  -->  00:03:22,850
And it's this huge list of stuff.
58

58

00:03:22,850  -->  00:03:24,600
And for now, let's get rid of this.
59

59

00:03:25,600  -->  00:03:29,073
Not all of it, but at least of them but one.
60

60

00:03:32,470  -->  00:03:35,060
Okay, and so I'm going to come back
61

61

00:03:35,060  -->  00:03:37,000
to the ingredients a bit later here.
62

62

00:03:37,000  -->  00:03:40,810
For now, I just want to finish with the directions.
63

63

00:03:40,810  -->  00:03:43,223
Where we have the publisher here.
64

64

00:03:45,380  -->  00:03:49,800
So the Pioneer Woman turns into recipe.author
65

65

00:03:49,800  -->  00:03:52,580
and then finally down here we have the U.R.L.
66

66

00:03:52,580  -->  00:03:56,203
That's where the directions of this recipe actually are.
67

67

00:03:57,860  -->  00:03:59,646
So our A.P.I. doesn't return us to directions
68

68

00:03:59,646  -->  00:04:01,530
of how to cook the recipe.
69

69

00:04:01,530  -->  00:04:03,880
It just gives us the link where the user
70

70

00:04:03,880  -->  00:04:06,560
can go ahead and find it.
71

71

00:04:06,560  -->  00:04:08,254
Okay, so that is the markup here now,
72

72

00:04:08,254  -->  00:04:10,470
except the ingredients.
73

73

00:04:10,470  -->  00:04:13,410
And before we move on, let's actually render it here
74

74

00:04:13,410  -->  00:04:16,080
with insert adjacent H.T.M.L.
75

75

00:04:16,080  -->  00:04:20,610
And so let's go ahead to our, where is it?
76

76

00:04:20,610  -->  00:04:25,610
Yeah, our base file, and create a field here
77

77

00:04:25,800  -->  00:04:29,870
for recipe and then go ahead and select that element.
78

78

00:04:29,870  -->  00:04:31,170
So document.querySelector.
79

79

00:04:33,610  -->  00:04:35,230
And remember that is actually called
80

80

00:04:35,230  -->  00:04:37,633
recipe also in the dumb.
81

81

00:04:39,160  -->  00:04:40,810
So give it a save, close it,
82

82

00:04:40,810  -->  00:04:43,710
and so we actually didn't import it yet.
83

83

00:04:43,710  -->  00:04:47,213
Okay so that's simply copy it from this one here.
84

84

00:04:51,350  -->  00:04:54,270
So that we can now use it in here.
85

85

00:04:54,270  -->  00:04:59,270
So, elements.recipe.insertAdjacentHTML
86

86

00:05:03,620  -->  00:05:05,820
And this one we want right at the beginning.
87

87

00:05:07,040  -->  00:05:10,053
So after begin and of course, markup.
88

88

00:05:11,500  -->  00:05:15,895
Alright, and now, about our ingredients here.
89

89

00:05:15,895  -->  00:05:17,970
So of course we don't know beforehand
90

90

00:05:17,970  -->  00:05:20,400
how many ingredients there are going to be.
91

91

00:05:20,400  -->  00:05:23,203
And so we have to do it here obviously with a loop.
92

92

00:05:24,480  -->  00:05:28,344
Okay, so what we're going to do here is to basically
93

93

00:05:28,344  -->  00:05:31,593
take our ingredients and then loop over them.
94

94

00:05:33,550  -->  00:05:35,780
And so remember that inside a template string,
95

95

00:05:35,780  -->  00:05:37,860
we cannot only just put it in the variables,
96

96

00:05:37,860  -->  00:05:40,295
but we can do all kinds of stuff.
97

97

00:05:40,295  -->  00:05:45,295
So recipe.ingredients.map and so this will loop over them
98

98

00:05:47,005  -->  00:05:50,360
and create a new array that we can then use.
99

99

00:05:50,360  -->  00:05:52,110
And so in there we then have access
100

100

00:05:52,110  -->  00:05:54,260
to each of the elements obviously.
101

101

00:05:54,260  -->  00:05:55,682
And so what we're going to do for each of the elements
102

102

00:05:55,682  -->  00:05:58,800
is to actually call a new function
103

103

00:05:58,800  -->  00:06:00,380
that I'm going to create in a second.
104

104

00:06:00,380  -->  00:06:02,430
Which is renderIngredient.
105

105

00:06:02,430  -->  00:06:05,070
Or actually, let's call it createIngredient.
106

106

00:06:06,989  -->  00:06:10,440
Because it will not really render anything to the screen
107

107

00:06:10,440  -->  00:06:13,023
so we will not create real dumb elements here.
108

108

00:06:14,190  -->  00:06:19,190
Okay, so createIngredient, let's put it up here.
109

109

00:06:21,910  -->  00:06:23,533
It does need to be exported.
110

110

00:06:25,705  -->  00:06:29,050
And so this is just what I put into the function.
111

111

00:06:29,050  -->  00:06:33,083
Ingredient, now it's correct.
112

112

00:06:34,930  -->  00:06:35,870
And actually, we don't even need this
113

113

00:06:35,870  -->  00:06:39,740
because such as before, we're actually just going to
114

114

00:06:40,728  -->  00:06:43,993
return a string from this one.
115

115

00:06:45,220  -->  00:06:48,203
Okay, so where is the code for this?
116

116

00:06:50,091  -->  00:06:51,543
And here we go.
117

117

00:06:54,490  -->  00:06:56,623
Whoa, what's happened here?
118

118

00:07:00,305  -->  00:07:02,663
Let's go ahead and put this right.
119

119

00:07:13,280  -->  00:07:14,540
And alright, now all we have to do
120

120

00:07:14,540  -->  00:07:16,780
is replace this stuff here.
121

121

00:07:16,780  -->  00:07:18,810
So first off we have the count
122

122

00:07:21,270  -->  00:07:25,313
which is ingredient.count, remember?
123

123

00:07:27,370  -->  00:07:29,563
Then we have the unit which here is gram.
124

124

00:07:32,860  -->  00:07:35,963
And then finally here is the ingredient itself.
125

125

00:07:37,250  -->  00:07:39,420
And right now, I'm actually remembering something
126

126

00:07:39,420  -->  00:07:41,226
which is that in recipe there's still something
127

127

00:07:41,226  -->  00:07:42,920
that we have to do.
128

128

00:07:42,920  -->  00:07:44,850
Okay, but let's leave that one for later.
129

129

00:07:44,850  -->  00:07:47,670
I hope I don't forget that I have to change something there.
130

130

00:07:47,670  -->  00:07:50,346
So this here will return this string to us
131

131

00:07:50,346  -->  00:07:53,840
that will then be put in to this new array.
132

132

00:07:53,840  -->  00:07:55,850
But we don't want an array here, right?
133

133

00:07:55,850  -->  00:07:57,140
We just want a string.
134

134

00:07:57,140  -->  00:07:59,293
Okay, so the result of this here.
135

135

00:08:00,361  -->  00:08:02,323
We will simply join it.
136

136

00:08:03,950  -->  00:08:06,973
So join it and that's it, okay.
137

137

00:08:06,973  -->  00:08:09,509
So again, this here returns an array
138

138

00:08:09,509  -->  00:08:12,165
in which each of the elements is the markup
139

139

00:08:12,165  -->  00:08:14,680
for one of the ingredients.
140

140

00:08:14,680  -->  00:08:16,520
Okay, but we don't want an array, of course,
141

141

00:08:16,520  -->  00:08:17,880
inside our H.T.M.L.
142

142

00:08:17,880  -->  00:08:19,950
We just want regular text.
143

143

00:08:19,950  -->  00:08:21,730
We can simply join all of the elements together
144

144

00:08:21,730  -->  00:08:23,581
as a huge string containing the markup
145

145

00:08:23,581  -->  00:08:26,093
for all of these ingredients.
146

146

00:08:26,950  -->  00:08:29,490
And of course, once again, we could of done this all inside
147

147

00:08:29,490  -->  00:08:31,410
of this callback function here instead
148

148

00:08:31,410  -->  00:08:33,470
of separating it into a new function.
149

149

00:08:33,470  -->  00:08:36,240
But I think it's much cleaner having it like this.
150

150

00:08:36,240  -->  00:08:39,320
And with that done, that's actually tested out.
151

151

00:08:39,320  -->  00:08:41,080
So we have a search controller.
152

152

00:08:41,080  -->  00:08:42,620
We had the recipe controller.
153

153

00:08:42,620  -->  00:08:44,610
And now instead of logging it into the console,
154

154

00:08:44,610  -->  00:08:47,000
we want to render it, obviously.
155

155

00:08:47,000  -->  00:08:49,220
So first off, we clear the loader.
156

156

00:08:49,220  -->  00:08:50,563
So just like before,
157

157

00:08:52,252  -->  00:08:54,600
and actually we don't have any loader yet.
158

158

00:08:54,600  -->  00:08:57,480
So we first have to put it there in a second.
159

159

00:08:57,480  -->  00:09:02,480
But let's just start by putting the recipeView.renderRecipe.
160

160

00:09:06,420  -->  00:09:08,680
And now we of course have to pass in the recipe.
161

161

00:09:08,680  -->  00:09:10,010
And so where is the recipe?
162

162

00:09:10,010  -->  00:09:14,720
Well it is at state.recipe obviously.
163

163

00:09:14,720  -->  00:09:16,350
Okay, so this clears the loader,
164

164

00:09:16,350  -->  00:09:18,740
but we still have to render the loader.
165

165

00:09:18,740  -->  00:09:20,910
And we do that right at the beginning here
166

166

00:09:20,910  -->  00:09:23,023
at Prepare U.I. for the changes.
167

167

00:09:23,860  -->  00:09:27,249
Right, so, we need to render the loader
168

168

00:09:27,249  -->  00:09:29,250
and now we need to pass in the parent.
169

169

00:09:29,250  -->  00:09:31,170
Remember, so you always need to pass in the parent
170

170

00:09:31,170  -->  00:09:32,862
so that the loader knows where
171

171

00:09:32,862  -->  00:09:36,420
to actually display itself basically, okay.
172

172

00:09:36,420  -->  00:09:39,950
And so this one here is now at elements.recipe.
173

173

00:09:39,950  -->  00:09:44,950
Remember, so the element that we just created before.
174

174

00:09:44,950  -->  00:09:47,180
So we rendered the loader, then we create the recipe,
175

175

00:09:47,180  -->  00:09:49,980
get the data, calculate all this stuff,
176

176

00:09:49,980  -->  00:09:52,610
then finally clear the loader once the data is back
177

177

00:09:52,610  -->  00:09:54,420
and then render it.
178

178

00:09:54,420  -->  00:09:56,650
And so, let's test it out now.
179

179

00:09:56,650  -->  00:09:59,740
And you see that it's already doing some stuff here.
180

180

00:09:59,740  -->  00:10:02,310
And that's because this one here is still active.
181

181

00:10:02,310  -->  00:10:04,663
And whoa, indeed, here it is.
182

182

00:10:06,460  -->  00:10:09,400
So, we have our Homemade Pizza here.
183

183

00:10:09,400  -->  00:10:12,380
So, the time, the servings, all of the ingredients.
184

184

00:10:12,380  -->  00:10:13,733
It's all there.
185

185

00:10:14,920  -->  00:10:17,351
And also here the author.
186

186

00:10:17,351  -->  00:10:18,993
Let's test it out here.
187

187

00:10:20,660  -->  00:10:21,740
Write pizza.
188

188

00:10:21,740  -->  00:10:23,970
Let's try it with this one here, for example.
189

189

00:10:23,970  -->  00:10:25,570
Ahh, and now I see something.
190

190

00:10:25,570  -->  00:10:28,620
We have to clear this old recipe
191

191

00:10:28,620  -->  00:10:31,070
before we can load a new one, okay.
192

192

00:10:31,070  -->  00:10:32,580
So let's wait for this one.
193

193

00:10:32,580  -->  00:10:36,275
And then take care of that clearing.
194

194

00:10:36,275  -->  00:10:40,253
So next up we need to clear this up, okay.
195

195

00:10:40,253  -->  00:10:45,253
So recipeView and then simply export.
196

196

00:10:58,490  -->  00:11:02,807
So elements.recipe.insertHTML
197

197

00:11:04,840  -->  00:11:08,220
Set to nothing, okay.
198

198

00:11:08,220  -->  00:11:13,220
And so now each time that we want to load a new recipe,
199

199

00:11:14,680  -->  00:11:16,850
we first need to clear it.
200

200

00:11:16,850  -->  00:11:19,027
So recipeView.clearRecipe
201

201

00:11:21,446  -->  00:11:23,117
Okay, so we clear the recipe then we render the loader
202

202

00:11:24,680  -->  00:11:26,503
and then all the rest happens.
203

203

00:11:28,550  -->  00:11:30,570
So let's search for pizza again.
204

204

00:11:30,570  -->  00:11:31,880
And now we have these two spinning here,
205

205

00:11:31,880  -->  00:11:33,383
but that's no problem at all.
206

206

00:11:35,420  -->  00:11:37,512
And so we have our Best Pizza Dough Ever.
207

207

00:11:37,512  -->  00:11:41,130
Let's take a look at this one here, for example.
208

208

00:11:41,130  -->  00:11:45,830
But I can already see that everything's working just fine.
209

209

00:11:45,830  -->  00:11:47,763
Alright, well, this looks delicious.
210

210

00:11:49,100  -->  00:11:52,960
Okay, so this is already working just fine.
211

211

00:11:52,960  -->  00:11:54,410
Now remember that I said that I needed
212

212

00:11:54,410  -->  00:11:57,160
to change something here in the recipe model?
213

213

00:11:57,160  -->  00:11:59,792
That's because here we have some of the units,
214

214

00:11:59,792  -->  00:12:03,730
but there can be other units like grams or kilograms.
215

215

00:12:03,730  -->  00:12:07,970
So in that case, we cannot really recognize it as units
216

216

00:12:07,970  -->  00:12:10,410
because, well in here for example,
217

217

00:12:10,410  -->  00:12:13,353
where we find the index for the unit,
218

218

00:12:13,353  -->  00:12:15,890
we test if it's included in the unitShort.
219

219

00:12:15,890  -->  00:12:19,897
And unitShort does not include like grams or kilograms.
220

220

00:12:19,897  -->  00:12:23,101
And so let's add these to this array
221

221

00:12:23,101  -->  00:12:25,740
and what I'm gonna do is to actually create
222

222

00:12:25,740  -->  00:12:27,853
a new array simply called units.
223

223

00:12:28,840  -->  00:12:31,490
And now I'm using E.S.6.D. structuring.
224

224

00:12:31,490  -->  00:12:33,146
So remember I can use these three dots
225

225

00:12:33,146  -->  00:12:36,488
to de-structure unitShort and what this will do
226

226

00:12:36,488  -->  00:12:39,310
is that basically it will separate it
227

227

00:12:39,310  -->  00:12:40,980
into its own components.
228

228

00:12:40,980  -->  00:12:42,860
So basically what this means is
229

229

00:12:42,860  -->  00:12:45,074
that instead of having an array inside of an array,
230

230

00:12:45,074  -->  00:12:47,310
we will have all of these elements.
231

231

00:12:47,310  -->  00:12:50,110
So it will take this elements out and put them here.
232

232

00:12:50,110  -->  00:12:54,853
Okay, and then we can add like kilogram or just gram.
233

233

00:12:57,184  -->  00:13:00,857
Now all we have to do is change it from unitShort
234

234

00:13:00,857  -->  00:13:03,440
just to units, okay.
235

235

00:13:03,440  -->  00:13:04,310
And so now we can recognize
236

236

00:13:04,310  -->  00:13:06,700
kilograms and grams here as well.
237

237

00:13:06,700  -->  00:13:10,680
Alright, now it already loaded
238

238

00:13:10,680  -->  00:13:12,380
because of the save that we did.
239

239

00:13:12,380  -->  00:13:13,961
So whenever we save something, then it reloads,
240

240

00:13:13,961  -->  00:13:16,120
and it already has the hash here
241

241

00:13:16,120  -->  00:13:18,411
and then it just loads the last recipe.
242

242

00:13:18,411  -->  00:13:22,141
Which is actually perfect, so that's exactly what we want.
243

243

00:13:22,141  -->  00:13:24,843
Now let's just look at this example here, for example.
244

244

00:13:25,770  -->  00:13:27,793
And you will see in the ingredients,
245

245

00:13:28,900  -->  00:13:29,767
let's wait for it.
246

246

00:13:29,767  -->  00:13:34,767
So you will see like this 4.5, 1.75, 0.25
247

247

00:13:34,944  -->  00:13:37,670
and that's well, that's not really ideal.
248

248

00:13:37,670  -->  00:13:42,150
So we want it back to like 1/4 or 4 and a 1/2
249

249

00:13:42,150  -->  00:13:44,120
like we had it initially, okay.
250

250

00:13:44,120  -->  00:13:47,630
And so we have to implement a function for doing that.
251

251

00:13:47,630  -->  00:13:48,535
So take a small break,
252

252

00:13:48,535  -->  00:13:50,560
and see you in a second in the next video
253

253

00:13:50,560  -->  00:13:52,260
where we're gonna do exactly that.
