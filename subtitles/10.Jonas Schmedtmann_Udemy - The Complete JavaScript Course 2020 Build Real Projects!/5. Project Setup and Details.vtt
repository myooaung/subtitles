00:00:00.776  -->  00:00:03.112
<v Instructor>Let's finally set up our project</v>
2

2

00:00:03.112  -->  00:00:06.384
and take a look at the game that we will code.
3

3

00:00:06.384  -->  00:00:09.183
As well as the rules of that game that we will need
4

4

00:00:09.183  -->  00:00:12.350
to implement in order to make it work.
5

5

00:00:13.360  -->  00:00:17.783
So I have the starter code here on my desktop, once again.
6

6

00:00:17.783  -->  00:00:21.720
So this code here, that is available for download.
7

7

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:24.751
So I'm going to go to my text editor now
8

8

00:00:24.751  -->  00:00:27.191
and open up that project.
9

9

00:00:27.191  -->  00:00:31.200
And by now you already know how it works, right?
10

10

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:35.183
So I go to my desktop and then hit open.
11

11

00:00:35.183  -->  00:00:38.920
And this text editor, so brackets creates a new working
12

12

00:00:38.920  -->  00:00:40.170
project for me.
13

13

00:00:41.023  -->  00:00:44.655
OK so this time, the stater project includes a little bit
14

14

00:00:44.655  -->  00:00:48.823
more than just a bare bones HTML structure.
15

15

00:00:48.823  -->  00:00:52.344
So this time, we have a real user interface
16

16

00:00:52.344  -->  00:00:56.024
that I coded for this game here in HTML
17

17

00:00:56.024  -->  00:00:59.441
as well as the CSS code for this project.
18

18

00:01:00.872  -->  00:01:03.423
And you can of course take a deep look at it
19

19

00:01:03.423  -->  00:01:06.639
if you want to know exactly how I coded it up.
20

20

00:01:06.639  -->  00:01:10.688
But on this project I want to focus fully on javascript
21

21

00:01:10.688  -->  00:01:15.264
and not how the HTML and CSS works in the background.
22

22

00:01:15.264  -->  00:01:19.335
OK so let's now take a look at the interface that I coded
23

23

00:01:19.335  -->  00:01:23.439
for this and now as you see I have the text editor here
24

24

00:01:23.439  -->  00:01:27.199
in full screen because now I need all the screen size
25

25

00:01:27.199  -->  00:01:28.729
that I can get.
26

26

00:01:28.729  -->  00:01:30.962
And I have the interface here on this side.
27

27

00:01:30.962  -->  00:01:33.168
So this is a beautiful interface that I created
28

28

00:01:33.168  -->  00:01:35.904
for our small little game, which is this one.
29

29

00:01:35.904  -->  00:01:39.032
So we have two players on left side and right side.
30

30

00:01:39.032  -->  00:01:43.583
And the goal of the game is to get to 100 points first.
31

31

00:01:43.583  -->  00:01:46.832
So I want to actually first take a look at the rules with
32

32

00:01:46.832  -->  00:01:50.231
you before I show it to you in action.
33

33

00:01:50.231  -->  00:01:54.528
So let's go back and open our javascript file.
34

34

00:01:54.528  -->  00:01:56.007
Which is this one.
35

35

00:01:56.007  -->  00:01:58.568
And once again, I already connected it for you.
36

36

00:01:58.568  -->  00:02:00.800
So down here we have the script, where we include
37

37

00:02:00.800  -->  00:02:02.133
the app.js file.
38

38

00:02:03.407  -->  00:02:06.490
Ok so this is the file which is empty
39

39

00:02:07.376  -->  00:02:10.904
except this comment here which includes the game rules.
40

40

00:02:10.904  -->  00:02:14.680
So as I mentioned there are two players and the game
41

41

00:02:14.680  -->  00:02:16.176
is played in rounds.
42

42

00:02:16.176  -->  00:02:19.951
And in each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as
43

43

00:02:19.951  -->  00:02:24.118
he wishes and each result gets added to his round score.
44

44

00:02:25.728  -->  00:02:29.496
But if the player rolls a 1, then all his round score
45

45

00:02:29.496  -->  00:02:34.008
gets lost and after that then it's the next player's turn.
46

46

00:02:34.008  -->  00:02:38.175
But in order to avoid that, the player can choose to hold.
47

47

00:02:39.055  -->  00:02:41.631
Which means that his round score gets added
48

48

00:02:41.631  -->  00:02:43.511
to his global score.
49

49

00:02:43.511  -->  00:02:47.368
And after that, it's again the next player's turn.
50

50

00:02:47.368  -->  00:02:50.016
And the first player to then reach 100 points on the
51

51

00:02:50.016  -->  00:02:52.975
global score wins the game.
52

52

00:02:52.975  -->  00:02:56.800
So let's now see the game in action very quickly.
53

53

00:02:56.800  -->  00:03:00.095
So player 1 starts the game and I'm going to start
54

54

00:03:00.095  -->  00:03:02.103
rolling the dice.
55

55

00:03:02.103  -->  00:03:03.919
All right, so I rolled a 4.
56

56

00:03:03.919  -->  00:03:08.336
So down here on my round score, I now have a 4.
57

57

00:03:08.336  -->  00:03:12.176
And I'm going to choose to hold and then the 4 points
58

58

00:03:12.176  -->  00:03:15.512
get transferred to my global score, which we have up here
59

59

00:03:15.512  -->  00:03:17.455
in this big size.
60

60

00:03:17.455  -->  00:03:20.111
And now it's player 2's turn which we can see by this
61

61

00:03:20.111  -->  00:03:22.861
gray background and this red dot.
62

62

00:03:24.159  -->  00:03:27.800
And I'm going to roll a dice as well and now I have 5.
63

63

00:03:27.800  -->  00:03:31.512
And I'm going to choose to roll again and I rolled a 3.
64

64

00:03:31.512  -->  00:03:35.688
So 3 plus the 5 that I had before is now 8.
65

65

00:03:35.688  -->  00:03:38.247
And I'm going to choose hold as well.
66

66

00:03:38.247  -->  00:03:41.936
So now player 2 here is in the lead.
67

67

00:03:41.936  -->  00:03:44.999
All right, player 1 once again.
68

68

00:03:44.999  -->  00:03:47.759
Now I'm going to roll the dice all the way until I roll
69

69

00:03:47.759  -->  00:03:50.727
a 1 which as you know will make me lose all of the score.
70

70

00:03:50.727  -->  00:03:53.477
So just to show you what happens.
71

71

00:03:56.488  -->  00:04:00.200
All right so I apparently rolled a 1 and lost all of my
72

72

00:04:00.200  -->  00:04:04.743
round score and nothing got added here, right?
73

73

00:04:04.743  -->  00:04:09.391
So I will now play with this one here, choose hold.
74

74

00:04:09.391  -->  00:04:12.641
And let's play this game until the end.
75

75

00:04:20.607  -->  00:04:21.463
And we have a winner here.
76

76

00:04:21.463  -->  00:04:23.911
Player 1 won the game.
77

77

00:04:23.911  -->  00:04:25.664
All right so this is how this game works,
78

78

00:04:25.664  -->  00:04:26.960
super fun right?
79

79

00:04:26.960  -->  00:04:30.552
I think it's really cool for a first real project.
80

80

00:04:30.552  -->  00:04:33.024
So let's go straight to the next lecture and start
81

81

00:04:33.024  -->  00:04:34.107
coding this.
