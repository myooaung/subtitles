00:00:01.293  -->  00:00:04.793
<v ->So, let's finally start our big project.</v>
2

2

00:00:05.713  -->  00:00:07.483
In this lecture, we'll take a first look
3

3

00:00:07.483  -->  00:00:09.916
at the application that we're gonna build
4

4

00:00:09.916  -->  00:00:11.326
throughout the section
5

5

00:00:11.326  -->  00:00:13.243
and set up our project.
6

6

00:00:14.210  -->  00:00:16.272
So this is our budget app,
7

7

00:00:16.272  -->  00:00:18.942
and I called it "Budgety" here
8

8

00:00:18.942  -->  00:00:21.022
for lack of a better name.
9

9

00:00:21.022  -->  00:00:22.784
But it serves, right?
10

10

00:00:22.784  -->  00:00:25.781
So this app allows us to add incomes
11

11

00:00:25.781  -->  00:00:28.582
and expenses for a certain month,
12

12

00:00:28.582  -->  00:00:31.665
which is in this case September 2016.
13

13

00:00:32.620  -->  00:00:35.236
And the app then calculates how much money we have made,
14

14

00:00:35.236  -->  00:00:36.730
and how much we spent,
15

15

00:00:36.730  -->  00:00:40.954
and then it gives us a nice budget here in this field.
16

16

00:00:40.954  -->  00:00:45.686
So just to test it, let's add some incomes here.
17

17

00:00:45.686  -->  00:00:49.019
Let's say we have made a website project
18

18

00:00:50.063  -->  00:00:53.313
and that we made 2500 Euros or dollars,
19

19

00:00:54.605  -->  00:00:56.729
and then we hit this button
20

20

00:00:56.729  -->  00:01:00.953
and then our income appears here in this list.
21

21

00:01:00.953  -->  00:01:02.127
So the value,
22

22

00:01:02.127  -->  00:01:03.207
and then here,
23

23

00:01:03.207  -->  00:01:06.459
these total income updates and a budget, as well.
24

24

00:01:06.459  -->  00:01:08.164
So let's put another income
25

25

00:01:08.164  -->  00:01:10.962
and suppose we sold our car.
26

26

00:01:10.962  -->  00:01:12.713
We didn't need it anymore,
27

27

00:01:12.713  -->  00:01:15.130
so for 1500 Euros or dollars.
28

28

00:01:16.004  -->  00:01:18.048
So this gets added to the list,
29

29

00:01:18.048  -->  00:01:20.597
and then our income gets added together.
30

30

00:01:20.597  -->  00:01:24.764
So 2500 plus 1500 makes 4000 dollars (or Euros).
31

31

00:01:26.606  -->  00:01:28.819
And then of course, we can add expenses.
32

32

00:01:28.819  -->  00:01:31.227
So we need to change this to minus here
33

33

00:01:31.227  -->  00:01:34.477
and then let's say we have to pay rent.
34

34

00:01:35.889  -->  00:01:37.139
So 900 dollars,
35

35

00:01:39.320  -->  00:01:40.245
and here we go.
36

36

00:01:40.245  -->  00:01:42.205
So now it's in the expense list,
37

37

00:01:42.205  -->  00:01:43.725
and this budget here got updated.
38

38

00:01:43.725  -->  00:01:46.475
So 4000 minus 900 is 3100, right?
39

39

00:01:48.820  -->  00:01:51.003
So this is the budget.
40

40

00:01:51.003  -->  00:01:54.466
Now let's say we went grocery shopping...
41

41

00:01:54.466  -->  00:01:57.216
So groceries, and we spent 97.42.
42

42

00:02:00.622  -->  00:02:03.670
Okay, so commas also work in here, right?
43

43

00:02:03.670  -->  00:02:06.837
And now let's say we went on a holiday
44

44

00:02:07.824  -->  00:02:09.157
and spent $1700.
45

45

00:02:11.474  -->  00:02:13.581
And if we make some kind of mistake,
46

46

00:02:13.581  -->  00:02:16.552
or just want to remove an item here from the list,
47

47

00:02:16.552  -->  00:02:18.261
we just need to click on these icons
48

48

00:02:18.261  -->  00:02:21.767
that appear as we hover over them, right?
49

49

00:02:21.767  -->  00:02:25.369
So, imagine that we didn't pay this amount after all.
50

50

00:02:25.369  -->  00:02:28.200
So we can just hit here, and then it disappears
51

51

00:02:28.200  -->  00:02:31.581
and everything else gets nicely updated here.
52

52

00:02:31.581  -->  00:02:33.561
So really cool, right?
53

53

00:02:33.561  -->  00:02:34.591
And there is more.
54

54

00:02:34.591  -->  00:02:38.373
So here we see in these percentages here
55

55

00:02:38.373  -->  00:02:41.558
the percentage that each of these expenses
56

56

00:02:41.558  -->  00:02:43.164
is of the total income.
57

57

00:02:43.164  -->  00:02:46.325
So for example, this holiday that we went on
58

58

00:02:46.325  -->  00:02:49.668
accounts for a total of 43%
59

59

00:02:49.668  -->  00:02:52.085
of our total income of $4000.
60

60

00:02:53.190  -->  00:02:57.832
And then this 900 Euros here or dollars for the rent
61

61

00:02:57.832  -->  00:03:00.278
is 23% of our income, right?
62

62

00:03:00.278  -->  00:03:03.077
And in total, we see that our expenses
63

63

00:03:03.077  -->  00:03:07.653
account for 65% of the money that we made in this month.
64

64

00:03:07.653  -->  00:03:09.025
So, in September.
65

65

00:03:09.025  -->  00:03:11.798
So these are basically the futures of the app
66

66

00:03:11.798  -->  00:03:13.290
that we're gonna code.
67

67

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:16.485
And I also gave this app a nice design
68

68

00:03:16.485  -->  00:03:19.794
so that the whole project gets more exciting for you.
69

69

00:03:19.794  -->  00:03:21.114
So you're gonna really end up with
70

70

00:03:21.114  -->  00:03:23.013
a cool and great-looking app
71

71

00:03:23.013  -->  00:03:25.856
that you can show to your friends or someone else,
72

72

00:03:25.856  -->  00:03:30.023
and not just some boring, ugly, you know, toy application.
73

73

00:03:30.957  -->  00:03:32.815
So I really put a lot of effort
74

74

00:03:32.815  -->  00:03:35.081
in this app to make it the perfect
75

75

00:03:35.081  -->  00:03:37.637
first real project for you.
76

76

00:03:37.637  -->  00:03:38.795
So, you see?
77

77

00:03:38.795  -->  00:03:42.379
We have a lot of code to write to make all of this work.
78

78

00:03:42.379  -->  00:03:44.331
So let's get to work and start
79

79

00:03:44.331  -->  00:03:46.939
by setting up the project.
80

80

00:03:46.939  -->  00:03:50.149
So, the starter project that you can download
81

81

00:03:50.149  -->  00:03:53.232
is already on the desktop, as always.
82

82

00:03:54.621  -->  00:03:57.159
So again, the name Budgety,
83

83

00:03:57.159  -->  00:03:59.404
and then just open the project folder
84

84

00:03:59.404  -->  00:04:01.453
and here is our project.
85

85

00:04:01.453  -->  00:04:03.575
So as in our pig game project,
86

86

00:04:03.575  -->  00:04:06.408
we have an already coded HTML file
87

87

00:04:07.338  -->  00:04:09.577
which we will see in greater detail later,
88

88

00:04:09.577  -->  00:04:11.502
as we start coding the app.
89

89

00:04:11.502  -->  00:04:14.482
And then of course, a CSS file
90

90

00:04:14.482  -->  00:04:15.863
where all the styles,
91

91

00:04:15.863  -->  00:04:18.515
where all the design of the application sits.
92

92

00:04:18.515  -->  00:04:20.191
But that doesn't matter to us,
93

93

00:04:20.191  -->  00:04:24.661
because what we want is of course this app.js file,
94

94

00:04:24.661  -->  00:04:25.647
which is the file
95

95

00:04:25.647  -->  00:04:29.378
where all of our Javascript code will go, right?
96

96

00:04:29.378  -->  00:04:32.038
So now we know how our final app looks like,
97

97

00:04:32.038  -->  00:04:33.358
how it works,
98

98

00:04:33.358  -->  00:04:35.526
and we have our project all set up.
99

99

00:04:35.526  -->  00:04:38.400
So we're ready to move on to the next lecture.
100

100

00:04:38.400  -->  00:04:39.567
See you there!
