1

00:00:01,108  -->  00:00:03,540
<v Narrator>So now that the recipe liking functionality</v>
2

2

00:00:03,540  -->  00:00:06,782
is 100% working, let's take it to the next level
3

3

00:00:06,782  -->  00:00:08,972
by persisting the likes data
4

4

00:00:08,972  -->  00:00:10,853
so that liked recipes are kept
5

5

00:00:10,853  -->  00:00:13,010
even after we reload the page.
6

6

00:00:13,010  -->  00:00:16,098
And we're gonna do that using the localStorage API.
7

7

00:00:16,098  -->  00:00:17,871
So that's something completely new
8

8

00:00:17,871  -->  00:00:19,538
and really exciting, I think,
9

9

00:00:19,538  -->  00:00:21,850
and so let's get started with it.
10

10

00:00:21,850  -->  00:00:24,536
So basically the web storage API allows us
11

11

00:00:24,536  -->  00:00:28,438
to very simply save key value pairs right in the browser.
12

12

00:00:28,438  -->  00:00:30,546
And this data will actually stay intact
13

13

00:00:30,546  -->  00:00:32,503
even after the page reloads.
14

14

00:00:32,503  -->  00:00:34,312
Okay, so it really stores this data
15

15

00:00:34,312  -->  00:00:35,854
right here in the browser.
16

16

00:00:35,854  -->  00:00:38,077
And before actually implementing it into the app
17

17

00:00:38,077  -->  00:00:41,565
I want to first start testing it here in the console, okay,
18

18

00:00:41,565  -->  00:00:43,803
just to show you how simple it actually is
19

19

00:00:43,803  -->  00:00:45,094
to use localStorage.
20

20

00:00:45,094  -->  00:00:47,209
So all we have to do is to say localStorage,
21

21

00:00:47,209  -->  00:00:49,336
which is basically a function that lives
22

22

00:00:49,336  -->  00:00:51,484
on the window object, on the global object,
23

23

00:00:51,484  -->  00:00:53,989
and so it's available to us everywhere.
24

24

00:00:53,989  -->  00:00:57,961
So all we have to do is say localStorage.setItem,
25

25

00:00:57,961  -->  00:01:00,466
and I should have used the tab, of course,
26

26

00:01:00,466  -->  00:01:02,049
and not the return.
27

27

00:01:04,004  -->  00:01:07,117
So setItem, and then as I mentioned,
28

28

00:01:07,117  -->  00:01:09,673
what we're gonna save here is a key value pair,
29

29

00:01:09,673  -->  00:01:11,565
so similar to what we do in objects.
30

30

00:01:11,565  -->  00:01:15,368
So we can specify a key, let's say ID for example,
31

31

00:01:15,368  -->  00:01:18,445
and this is always a string, and then a value.
32

32

00:01:18,445  -->  00:01:21,683
And also the value always has to be a string, okay?
33

33

00:01:21,683  -->  00:01:25,049
So we cannot really save JavaScript objects or arrays
34

34

00:01:25,049  -->  00:01:26,400
or something like that in here.
35

35

00:01:26,400  -->  00:01:29,158
Well, we actually can, and we're gonna see how in a second,
36

36

00:01:29,158  -->  00:01:31,596
but they still have to be always strings.
37

37

00:01:31,596  -->  00:01:33,466
So let's put some string here.
38

38

00:01:33,466  -->  00:01:35,883
It doesn't really matter.
39

39

00:01:35,883  -->  00:01:39,244
And so now we set this item into our local storage.
40

40

00:01:39,244  -->  00:01:40,828
Okay, and that's actually it.
41

41

00:01:40,828  -->  00:01:42,267
Now if we want to retrieve it,
42

42

00:01:42,267  -->  00:01:45,517
we can simply use localStorage.getItem,
43

43

00:01:47,064  -->  00:01:50,397
and then we just have to pass in the key
44

44

00:01:51,478  -->  00:01:54,097
and it gets back our data.
45

45

00:01:54,097  -->  00:01:56,305
Okay, so that's really simple,
46

46

00:01:56,305  -->  00:01:58,059
and that's actually all we have to do
47

47

00:01:58,059  -->  00:02:00,169
in order to use local storage.
48

48

00:02:00,169  -->  00:02:01,916
Let's add something more,
49

49

00:02:01,916  -->  00:02:03,666
localStorage.setItem,
50

50

00:02:05,666  -->  00:02:07,666
let's say, like, recipe,
51

51

00:02:12,659  -->  00:02:14,653
and something like tomato pasta.
52

52

00:02:14,653  -->  00:02:17,980
What we can also do is to simply say localStorage,
53

53

00:02:17,980  -->  00:02:20,917
and then it will show us what we have in our storage.
54

54

00:02:20,917  -->  00:02:25,280
So we right now have the ID that we defined and our recipe.
55

55

00:02:25,280  -->  00:02:28,324
Then coming from webpack we also have this weird thing here.
56

56

00:02:28,324  -->  00:02:31,887
Okay, so webpack also uses actually the local storage
57

57

00:02:31,887  -->  00:02:33,399
to save some data into there.
58

58

00:02:33,399  -->  00:02:36,227
And then we always have access to the length property.
59

59

00:02:36,227  -->  00:02:40,144
Okay, so we can always say localStorage.length,
60

60

00:02:41,342  -->  00:02:43,752
and in this case it will then return three.
61

61

00:02:43,752  -->  00:02:46,406
Now what is so special about local storage, as I mentioned,
62

62

00:02:46,406  -->  00:02:49,054
is that the data persists throughout page loads.
63

63

00:02:49,054  -->  00:02:51,693
So let's actually reload the page.
64

64

00:02:51,693  -->  00:02:55,559
And so let's open local storage again,
65

65

00:02:55,559  -->  00:02:57,857
and our data is still there.
66

66

00:02:57,857  -->  00:03:00,215
So we have the ID and the recipes still here.
67

67

00:03:00,215  -->  00:03:02,734
Now we can set items, we can get them back,
68

68

00:03:02,734  -->  00:03:07,151
and we can also remove them, and very simple as well.
69

69

00:03:08,304  -->  00:03:12,221
So remove item, pass in the key, and that's it.
70

70

00:03:14,948  -->  00:03:16,991
Let's take a look at the local storage again,
71

71

00:03:16,991  -->  00:03:19,191
and you'll see that now it's gone, okay?
72

72

00:03:19,191  -->  00:03:21,626
So as you see, the localStorage API is very simple.
73

73

00:03:21,626  -->  00:03:24,555
We just have setItem, getItem, and removeItem,
74

74

00:03:24,555  -->  00:03:27,373
and also the length property, okay?
75

75

00:03:27,373  -->  00:03:28,951
So that's really all you need to know
76

76

00:03:28,951  -->  00:03:31,363
in order to use localStorage.
77

77

00:03:31,363  -->  00:03:33,257
All right, so let's now go ahead
78

78

00:03:33,257  -->  00:03:35,817
and implement it in our app.
79

79

00:03:35,817  -->  00:03:39,400
Okay, and we start by opening up our model.
80

80

00:03:41,096  -->  00:03:43,786
Okay, so this is it, because this is where
81

81

00:03:43,786  -->  00:03:46,427
we actually want to implement the local storage.
82

82

00:03:46,427  -->  00:03:48,664
Now how are we going to do this?
83

83

00:03:48,664  -->  00:03:51,063
Well, I think the easiest way to do it
84

84

00:03:51,063  -->  00:03:54,570
is to each time that we change our likes right here
85

85

00:03:54,570  -->  00:03:56,563
is to then persist that data,
86

86

00:03:56,563  -->  00:03:59,497
so to basically store that data into the local storage.
87

87

00:03:59,497  -->  00:04:01,678
And so that's when whenever we add a like
88

88

00:04:01,678  -->  00:04:03,069
and when we delete a like.
89

89

00:04:03,069  -->  00:04:05,153
So when we change the like array,
90

90

00:04:05,153  -->  00:04:06,616
then at that exact moment
91

91

00:04:06,616  -->  00:04:09,169
we should save it into the local storage.
92

92

00:04:09,169  -->  00:04:13,086
Okay, so let's just add a comment here quickly.
93

93

00:04:18,207  -->  00:04:21,132
Persist the data in local storage.
94

94

00:04:21,132  -->  00:04:25,069
And then the same thing here in the deleteLike method.
95

95

00:04:25,069  -->  00:04:27,151
Okay, and so this is the same thing here.
96

96

00:04:27,151  -->  00:04:28,868
We will do this in both methods.
97

97

00:04:28,868  -->  00:04:31,579
And so let's add a new method that we can then call
98

98

00:04:31,579  -->  00:04:33,430
from both addLike and deleteLike.
99

99

00:04:33,430  -->  00:04:37,263
Okay, so let's call this one here persistData.
100

100

00:04:42,748  -->  00:04:46,151
Here with the common case notation, and okay.
101

101

00:04:46,151  -->  00:04:48,008
So it's very simple.
102

102

00:04:48,008  -->  00:04:52,415
We just say setItem, and we're gonna call it likes,
103

103

00:04:52,415  -->  00:04:54,261
and then what we want to save here
104

104

00:04:54,261  -->  00:04:57,179
is the entire this.likes array, basically.
105

105

00:04:57,179  -->  00:05:00,298
Now remember that in here we can only save strings.
106

106

00:05:00,298  -->  00:05:03,263
So we have to convert that array into a string.
107

107

00:05:03,263  -->  00:05:07,430
So we can say JSON.stringify, and then this.likes.
108

108

00:05:09,544  -->  00:05:12,763
And this will basically transform it into a string here,
109

109

00:05:12,763  -->  00:05:15,083
which then later when we read the storage,
110

110

00:05:15,083  -->  00:05:17,263
we can convert it back to an array.
111

111

00:05:17,263  -->  00:05:18,888
Okay, and that's actually it.
112

112

00:05:18,888  -->  00:05:21,049
So that's all we have to do to persist our data,
113

113

00:05:21,049  -->  00:05:24,060
and now, of course, call it from these two methods.
114

114

00:05:24,060  -->  00:05:25,310
So persistData.
115

115

00:05:27,690  -->  00:05:29,492
So I forgot the this.
116

116

00:05:29,492  -->  00:05:32,299
So it's a method on this exact object,
117

117

00:05:32,299  -->  00:05:36,549
and so we have to say, of course, this.persistData.
118

118

00:05:37,656  -->  00:05:40,699
Okay, and let's actually test it our now.
119

119

00:05:40,699  -->  00:05:42,395
So we reload the page,
120

120

00:05:42,395  -->  00:05:45,018
and then let's now like this recipe.
121

121

00:05:45,018  -->  00:05:46,768
And now localStorage,
122

122

00:05:49,408  -->  00:05:52,284
and, ooh, here we actually already have our likes.
123

123

00:05:52,284  -->  00:05:55,266
So it's already stored in the local storage.
124

124

00:05:55,266  -->  00:05:56,570
And you see that it actually did
125

125

00:05:56,570  -->  00:05:58,447
convert the array into a string,
126

126

00:05:58,447  -->  00:06:01,054
and all of the objects that are inside it,
127

127

00:06:01,054  -->  00:06:02,674
well, right now it's just only one,
128

128

00:06:02,674  -->  00:06:04,628
but it still also converted all that
129

129

00:06:04,628  -->  00:06:06,962
just into strings, okay?
130

130

00:06:06,962  -->  00:06:09,853
And if you now go ahead and add more,
131

131

00:06:09,853  -->  00:06:11,202
let's take a look.
132

132

00:06:11,202  -->  00:06:12,915
So I have the sweet potato,
133

133

00:06:12,915  -->  00:06:16,332
and let's do it just with this first one.
134

134

00:06:17,949  -->  00:06:19,814
So we liked it,
135

135

00:06:19,814  -->  00:06:23,231
and now into the local storage here.
136

136

00:06:23,231  -->  00:06:25,944
Yeah, we see that we now have both of them
137

137

00:06:25,944  -->  00:06:27,686
in here in this string, okay?
138

138

00:06:27,686  -->  00:06:29,362
So it's important to know that it's all
139

139

00:06:29,362  -->  00:06:31,610
in the same likes key, okay?
140

140

00:06:31,610  -->  00:06:34,057
So we only have one key, which is for the likes,
141

141

00:06:34,057  -->  00:06:36,129
and then all the likes will be stored
142

142

00:06:36,129  -->  00:06:38,796
in that singular one, all right?
143

143

00:06:39,769  -->  00:06:41,760
Now next up we actually need a method
144

144

00:06:41,760  -->  00:06:44,154
to read the data back from the local storage
145

145

00:06:44,154  -->  00:06:46,189
when we load a page, right?
146

146

00:06:46,189  -->  00:06:48,476
So imagine the scenario that we're reloading a page,
147

147

00:06:48,476  -->  00:06:50,309
and we again want to have access
148

148

00:06:50,309  -->  00:06:52,335
to all our liked recipes
149

149

00:06:52,335  -->  00:06:55,762
so that we can then put them here into this list, right?
150

150

00:06:55,762  -->  00:06:58,583
Because if we reload it now,
151

151

00:06:58,583  -->  00:07:01,695
then the data will, of course, stay in the local storage,
152

152

00:07:01,695  -->  00:07:04,498
but will be gone here from our list, okay?
153

153

00:07:04,498  -->  00:07:06,498
And so we have to add them back
154

154

00:07:06,498  -->  00:07:08,162
into the list here, of course.
155

155

00:07:08,162  -->  00:07:10,990
So first off we need a method to retrieve
156

156

00:07:10,990  -->  00:07:13,435
these likes from the local storage, okay?
157

157

00:07:13,435  -->  00:07:16,852
And so let's add that to the likes model.
158

158

00:07:18,214  -->  00:07:19,964
Okay, so readStorage.
159

159

00:07:24,466  -->  00:07:28,049
And so let's first save it into a variable.
160

160

00:07:30,484  -->  00:07:35,165
And so all we have to say is localStorage.getItem, remember,
161

161

00:07:35,165  -->  00:07:37,755
and then the name of the key, which is likes.
162

162

00:07:37,755  -->  00:07:40,419
Now remember that this here will be a string, okay?
163

163

00:07:40,419  -->  00:07:43,342
And so we have to convert it back into a JavaScript array
164

164

00:07:43,342  -->  00:07:44,623
like we said before.
165

165

00:07:44,623  -->  00:07:47,622
So we have JSON.stringify to turn it into a string.
166

166

00:07:47,622  -->  00:07:49,014
And then we have the opposite
167

167

00:07:49,014  -->  00:07:53,097
which also lives in a JSON object, so JSON.parse.
168

168

00:07:54,696  -->  00:07:56,505
Okay, and so this will convert everything
169

169

00:07:56,505  -->  00:07:57,961
back to the structures,
170

170

00:07:57,961  -->  00:08:00,353
the data structures that it was before.
171

171

00:08:00,353  -->  00:08:02,347
Now if there's nothing in the local storage
172

172

00:08:02,347  -->  00:08:03,585
or this likes here,
173

173

00:08:03,585  -->  00:08:05,718
so if you did never store any like,
174

174

00:08:05,718  -->  00:08:07,969
then this here will return null, okay?
175

175

00:08:07,969  -->  00:08:10,161
So this localStorage.getItem,
176

176

00:08:10,161  -->  00:08:12,298
when it doesn't have the key that we're looking for,
177

177

00:08:12,298  -->  00:08:13,646
it will return null.
178

178

00:08:13,646  -->  00:08:15,987
And so we have to now test for this.
179

179

00:08:15,987  -->  00:08:18,070
So if there is a storage,
180

180

00:08:20,043  -->  00:08:22,126
so basically if it's not null,
181

181

00:08:22,126  -->  00:08:24,691
well, then we simply want to say that this.likes
182

182

00:08:24,691  -->  00:08:28,602
should be the likes that we just read out of the storage.
183

183

00:08:28,602  -->  00:08:30,640
Okay, so in this line here,
184

184

00:08:30,640  -->  00:08:34,115
we are basically restoring all our likes from the storage.
185

185

00:08:34,115  -->  00:08:35,477
Let's write that down here,
186

186

00:08:35,477  -->  00:08:37,944
because I think it's important to remember.
187

187

00:08:37,944  -->  00:08:38,777
So restore
188

188

00:08:44,887  -->  00:08:47,304
from the local storage, okay?
189

189

00:08:47,304  -->  00:08:49,516
So this one here is important to store
190

190

00:08:49,516  -->  00:08:52,153
the result of what we read from the local storage
191

191

00:08:52,153  -->  00:08:55,003
back into this.likes, all right?
192

192

00:08:55,003  -->  00:08:58,526
So let's now go back to our browser and test it out.
193

193

00:08:58,526  -->  00:09:01,033
Okay, and you see that we have access
194

194

00:09:01,033  -->  00:09:03,646
to, of course, the local storage first of all
195

195

00:09:03,646  -->  00:09:05,313
where we have our likes,
196

196

00:09:05,313  -->  00:09:07,319
and we also have access to the state
197

197

00:09:07,319  -->  00:09:09,304
through the window object, okay?
198

198

00:09:09,304  -->  00:09:11,906
Remember that we attached it to the window object
199

199

00:09:11,906  -->  00:09:13,561
for our testing purposes.
200

200

00:09:13,561  -->  00:09:16,651
And so right now we have this likes object in here,
201

201

00:09:16,651  -->  00:09:18,016
but it is still empty.
202

202

00:09:18,016  -->  00:09:20,374
And so let's now call the readStorage method
203

203

00:09:20,374  -->  00:09:22,071
that we just coded.
204

204

00:09:22,071  -->  00:09:24,321
So state.likes.readStorage.
205

205

00:09:28,615  -->  00:09:32,180
Okay, and now let's check it out again.
206

206

00:09:32,180  -->  00:09:36,073
So now we should have the data in the likes.
207

207

00:09:36,073  -->  00:09:38,240
And indeed, here they are.
208

208

00:09:39,715  -->  00:09:41,994
So they are back to being objects,
209

209

00:09:41,994  -->  00:09:45,146
and so everything is working perfect.
210

210

00:09:45,146  -->  00:09:47,787
So remember, we reloaded the page, and of course,
211

211

00:09:47,787  -->  00:09:50,154
the likes were gone from the likes object,
212

212

00:09:50,154  -->  00:09:52,434
but they were still in the local storage.
213

213

00:09:52,434  -->  00:09:54,372
And we then call the readStorage method
214

214

00:09:54,372  -->  00:09:57,513
that we coded up before in order to restore these likes
215

215

00:09:57,513  -->  00:09:59,387
back into the likes object
216

216

00:09:59,387  -->  00:10:01,288
that we have here in our global state.
217

217

00:10:01,288  -->  00:10:02,351
Okay, and so now you can see
218

218

00:10:02,351  -->  00:10:05,284
that they are now here back in the object.
219

219

00:10:05,284  -->  00:10:07,063
All right, and so now all we have to do
220

220

00:10:07,063  -->  00:10:09,146
is to do exactly this here automatically
221

221

00:10:09,146  -->  00:10:10,962
in the controller, of course.
222

222

00:10:10,962  -->  00:10:12,912
Okay, so this here is done.
223

223

00:10:12,912  -->  00:10:14,437
Let's go back to the controller
224

224

00:10:14,437  -->  00:10:18,770
and add a new event handler for when the page loads.
225

225

00:10:19,609  -->  00:10:21,383
Okay, so what we just did in the console
226

226

00:10:21,383  -->  00:10:25,210
is what we want to do each time that the page loads.
227

227

00:10:25,210  -->  00:10:28,377
So restore liked recipes on page load.
228

228

00:10:34,070  -->  00:10:37,737
So window.eventListener when the page loads.
229

229

00:10:43,025  -->  00:10:44,862
And so each time the page loads,
230

230

00:10:44,862  -->  00:10:47,778
we want to start by creating the new likes object.
231

231

00:10:47,778  -->  00:10:49,606
So basically what we did up here,
232

232

00:10:49,606  -->  00:10:53,596
we now need to do it inside of that event handler.
233

233

00:10:53,596  -->  00:10:55,921
And so this was just for testing, remember,
234

234

00:10:55,921  -->  00:10:58,838
and so now we're getting rid of it.
235

235

00:10:59,729  -->  00:11:02,176
So we start by creating the new likes object,
236

236

00:11:02,176  -->  00:11:05,073
which will of course be empty after a page reload.
237

237

00:11:05,073  -->  00:11:07,980
Okay, but now we can then fill it
238

238

00:11:07,980  -->  00:11:11,055
just like we did in the console a minute ago.
239

239

00:11:11,055  -->  00:11:13,638
And so we just say readStorage.
240

240

00:11:16,993  -->  00:11:20,326
And with that, our likes are back, okay?
241

241

00:11:22,621  -->  00:11:25,788
So let's add some comments here again.
242

242

00:11:28,619  -->  00:11:31,869
Then we also want to toggle the button.
243

243

00:11:35,228  -->  00:11:37,868
Okay, so just like we did up here also,
244

244

00:11:37,868  -->  00:11:40,401
so that in case if there are some likes,
245

245

00:11:40,401  -->  00:11:42,347
then the button is actually displayed.
246

246

00:11:42,347  -->  00:11:43,841
And then finally, of course,
247

247

00:11:43,841  -->  00:11:45,928
we want to render all liked recipes
248

248

00:11:45,928  -->  00:11:48,457
up there in the menu, right?
249

249

00:11:48,457  -->  00:11:50,874
So render the existing likes.
250

250

00:11:54,776  -->  00:11:59,164
So state.likes, and dot-likes again, right,
251

251

00:11:59,164  -->  00:12:04,121
because that's the way that we called the likes array.
252

252

00:12:04,121  -->  00:12:06,454
And so now we call for each.
253

253

00:12:08,298  -->  00:12:12,246
And so for each like, what we want to do
254

254

00:12:12,246  -->  00:12:14,015
is to say just like we did before,
255

255

00:12:14,015  -->  00:12:17,265
so likesView and then pass in the like.
256

256

00:12:18,563  -->  00:12:19,923
And that's it.
257

257

00:12:19,923  -->  00:12:23,067
So this is the code for restoring our likes
258

258

00:12:23,067  -->  00:12:25,277
from the local storage, okay?
259

259

00:12:25,277  -->  00:12:28,341
Well, actually this is not the right code,
260

260

00:12:28,341  -->  00:12:32,924
so this is, of course, it's likesView.renderLike, okay?
261

261

00:12:35,078  -->  00:12:36,181
So now it's right.
262

262

00:12:36,181  -->  00:12:39,649
So maybe you have spotted that already, while I did not.
263

263

00:12:39,649  -->  00:12:41,841
So anyway, this should now be working.
264

264

00:12:41,841  -->  00:12:43,341
Let's test it out.
265

265

00:12:44,677  -->  00:12:46,852
And you see, our list is up here,
266

266

00:12:46,852  -->  00:12:50,587
and both the recipes we had liked before are now there.
267

267

00:12:50,587  -->  00:12:55,479
So the Best Pizza Dough Ever, let's now unlike it.
268

268

00:12:55,479  -->  00:12:56,634
It's gone here.
269

269

00:12:56,634  -->  00:12:58,467
Let's reload the page,
270

270

00:12:59,924  -->  00:13:01,955
and you'll see it's still gone.
271

271

00:13:01,955  -->  00:13:03,872
So that's just perfect.
272

272

00:13:05,130  -->  00:13:07,179
Let's try it with a couple others.
273

273

00:13:07,179  -->  00:13:09,679
Let's try the Deep Dish Fruit.
274

274

00:13:11,522  -->  00:13:12,451
Let's like this one.
275

275

00:13:12,451  -->  00:13:15,199
And the Cauliflower, this one looks great as well,
276

276

00:13:15,199  -->  00:13:16,616
so let's like it.
277

277

00:13:18,093  -->  00:13:20,345
And of course, they're all there.
278

278

00:13:20,345  -->  00:13:24,123
If we go back to it, the like will still be displayed.
279

279

00:13:24,123  -->  00:13:28,170
And now when I reload the page, they're all still there.
280

280

00:13:28,170  -->  00:13:29,714
And the recipe is still liked here
281

281

00:13:29,714  -->  00:13:31,390
with the, as you can see, the button,
282

282

00:13:31,390  -->  00:13:33,737
and it's also liked here, okay?
283

283

00:13:33,737  -->  00:13:35,369
So that's it.
284

284

00:13:35,369  -->  00:13:36,904
It's working now.
285

285

00:13:36,904  -->  00:13:38,771
That's the end of our project.
286

286

00:13:38,771  -->  00:13:40,871
We have implemented all the functionalities
287

287

00:13:40,871  -->  00:13:41,950
that I wanted to show you.
288

288

00:13:41,950  -->  00:13:43,761
And I believe and hope for sure
289

289

00:13:43,761  -->  00:13:46,593
that you learned a lot along the way.
290

290

00:13:46,593  -->  00:13:48,161
So the next lecture we will just have
291

291

00:13:48,161  -->  00:13:49,793
some final considerations
292

292

00:13:49,793  -->  00:13:51,788
and then really wrap up this project.
293

293

00:13:51,788  -->  00:13:54,288
So see you there in a second.
