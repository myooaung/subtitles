00:00:01.247  -->  00:00:03.350
<v Jonas>Welcome back to the next lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.350  -->  00:00:06.379
and this is a very important one, because in this one
3

3

00:00:06.379  -->  00:00:10.198
we're gonna start taking decisions using code.
4

4

00:00:10.198  -->  00:00:13.150
So JavaScript, as well as most other programming languages
5

5

00:00:13.150  -->  00:00:16.042
out there, has a couple of control structures
6

6

00:00:16.042  -->  00:00:18.668
which are features that allow us to execute
7

7

00:00:18.668  -->  00:00:20.597
only certain parts of our code,
8

8

00:00:20.597  -->  00:00:23.376
or to execute parts multiple times.
9

9

00:00:23.376  -->  00:00:25.789
The first control structure that we will talk about
10

10

00:00:25.789  -->  00:00:28.862
is the 'if / else' statement which is a conditional
11

11

00:00:28.862  -->  00:00:33.308
which basically allows us to take decisions using code.
12

12

00:00:33.308  -->  00:00:35.742
Let me show you how that works.
13

13

00:00:35.742  -->  00:00:38.586
First, let's bring back some of our variables.
14

14

00:00:38.586  -->  00:00:40.836
So, let's say first name...
15

15

00:00:42.235  -->  00:00:43.985
...is, again, 'John'.
16

16

00:00:44.997  -->  00:00:47.909
Now, let's create a variable that we didn't use before,
17

17

00:00:47.909  -->  00:00:50.477
which is for the civil status.
18

18

00:00:50.477  -->  00:00:53.689
So, "civilStatus", and so this one basically says
19

19

00:00:53.689  -->  00:00:56.442
if you're married, or single, or divorced
20

20

00:00:56.442  -->  00:00:57.902
or something like that.
21

21

00:00:57.902  -->  00:01:02.902
Let's just say that John is a 'single', so he's not married.
22

22

00:01:03.453  -->  00:01:05.190
Now what we want to do here is to log
23

23

00:01:05.190  -->  00:01:09.897
a string to the console, whether he is married or not.
24

24

00:01:09.897  -->  00:01:12.143
For that, we can use an 'if / else' statement
25

25

00:01:12.143  -->  00:01:15.991
to take decisions: we write 'if', and then
26

26

00:01:15.991  -->  00:01:17.992
we open parenthesis, then in here
27

27

00:01:17.992  -->  00:01:20.327
we have to write a logical condition,
28

28

00:01:20.327  -->  00:01:23.808
so something that returns a Boolean 'true' or 'false' value.
29

29

00:01:23.808  -->  00:01:25.825
That's something like we did before,
30

30

00:01:25.825  -->  00:01:27.671
so for example, this one here.
31

31

00:01:27.671  -->  00:01:30.031
This will return a 'true' or 'false' value,
32

32

00:01:30.031  -->  00:01:33.018
so it's a perfect logic condition.
33

33

00:01:33.018  -->  00:01:34.747
Now, in this case we don't want a greater
34

34

00:01:34.747  -->  00:01:37.381
over smaller comparison like the one that I showed you,
35

35

00:01:37.381  -->  00:01:39.970
but instead we want an equality operator.
36

36

00:01:39.970  -->  00:01:42.251
Basically, what we want to do is to test
37

37

00:01:42.251  -->  00:01:44.926
if the civil status is 'married'.
38

38

00:01:44.926  -->  00:01:47.045
Let me show you how to do that.
39

39

00:01:47.045  -->  00:01:49.795
We can say civil status equals...
40

40

00:01:52.095  -->  00:01:53.178
...'married'.
41

41

00:01:54.136  -->  00:01:56.937
So, this condition here will return 'true'
42

42

00:01:56.937  -->  00:02:01.937
if the civil status is 'married', and 'false' if it's not.
43

43

00:02:02.131  -->  00:02:04.907
This here, again, is like a logical operator
44

44

00:02:04.907  -->  00:02:06.704
which returns 'true' or 'false'.
45

45

00:02:06.704  -->  00:02:09.193
There's also the version with just two equals,
46

46

00:02:09.193  -->  00:02:13.089
but let's talk about that one a bit later.
47

47

00:02:13.089  -->  00:02:15.320
Again, this here will test whether the
48

48

00:02:15.320  -->  00:02:17.925
civil status is 'married' or not.
49

49

00:02:17.925  -->  00:02:21.644
Then, we open curly braces, and then this here
50

50

00:02:21.644  -->  00:02:24.776
is the block, the 'if' block, and in here we can now
51

51

00:02:24.776  -->  00:02:27.501
write our instructions, basically;
52

52

00:02:27.501  -->  00:02:31.064
in this case, our 'console.log()',
53

53

00:02:31.064  -->  00:02:34.241
and what we want to log to console is
54

54

00:02:34.241  -->  00:02:35.324
'firstName...
55

55

00:02:38.666  -->  00:02:39.916
...is married!'
56

56

00:02:41.961  -->  00:02:45.121
If the civil status is 'married', then this text here
57

57

00:02:45.121  -->  00:02:46.754
will be logged to the console,
58

58

00:02:46.754  -->  00:02:49.516
and, if not, well then nothing happens.
59

59

00:02:49.516  -->  00:02:52.695 line:15% 
So let's reload it and, indeed, nothing happens.
60

60

00:02:52.695  -->  00:02:55.240
That's because right now, this here turns out
61

61

00:02:55.240  -->  00:02:57.561
to be 'false' because the civil status
62

62

00:02:57.561  -->  00:03:00.110
is actually 'single' and not 'married'.
63

63

00:03:00.110  -->  00:03:02.877
This is different, so when we have 'false',
64

64

00:03:02.877  -->  00:03:05.673
well, then this piece of code is not executed.
65

65

00:03:05.673  -->  00:03:09.172
Let's change it here to 'married' for a second
66

66

00:03:09.172  -->  00:03:13.348 line:15% 
just to see if it's working just fine, and it is.
67

67

00:03:13.348  -->  00:03:16.363 line:15% 
Now it says 'John is married!', because the civil status
68

68

00:03:16.363  -->  00:03:19.863
is the exact same thing as 'married' here.
69

69

00:03:20.754  -->  00:03:22.663
Anyway, let's change it back to 'single',
70

70

00:03:22.663  -->  00:03:24.112
because now I want to show you
71

71

00:03:24.112  -->  00:03:26.852
the 'else' part of the 'if / else' statement.
72

72

00:03:26.852  -->  00:03:28.845
We can have only the 'if' part,
73

73

00:03:28.845  -->  00:03:31.962
but we can also add an 'else' statement.
74

74

00:03:31.962  -->  00:03:35.914
So, we can say 'else', then we have the 'else' block here.
75

75

00:03:35.914  -->  00:03:39.469
What this does is that, if this is not 'true' here,
76

76

00:03:39.469  -->  00:03:44.469
so if it's 'false', then it will execute the 'else' block.
77

77

00:03:44.523  -->  00:03:46.190
Let's test it out...
78

78

00:03:51.757  -->  00:03:54.174
...will hopefully marry soon.
79

79

00:03:56.865  -->  00:04:01.621
That, of course, means that he is not married at this point.
80

80

00:04:01.621  -->  00:04:04.298
Let's test it, and let's keep in mind that here it tests
81

81

00:04:04.298  -->  00:04:07.335
'single', and so this part here will not be executed,
82

82

00:04:07.335  -->  00:04:09.965
because this here is false, and that means
83

83

00:04:09.965  -->  00:04:12.126
that we're gonna jump right to the 'else' block,
84

84

00:04:12.126  -->  00:04:15.804
so this text here should be logged to the console.
85

85

00:04:15.804  -->  00:04:18.444 line:15% 
Check it out, (takes a breath) and yeah it works.
86

86

00:04:18.444  -->  00:04:20.898
So, 'John will hopefully marry soon'.
87

87

00:04:20.898  -->  00:04:22.086
Now, let's say that we actually
88

88

00:04:22.086  -->  00:04:24.068
have a Boolean variable already.
89

89

00:04:24.068  -->  00:04:27.735
We can have a variable called 'isMarried'...
90

90

00:04:30.785  -->  00:04:34.002
...and let's set it to 'false', and let's then
91

91

00:04:34.002  -->  00:04:36.585
test what happens in that case.
92

92

00:04:39.026  -->  00:04:41.161
So, instead of this test here we could put
93

93

00:04:41.161  -->  00:04:45.481
'isMarried', and then we could put equals 'true',
94

94

00:04:45.481  -->  00:04:49.140
but that part is actually not really necessary,
95

95

00:04:49.140  -->  00:04:51.668
because what we need here in this condition
96

96

00:04:51.668  -->  00:04:54.784
is a 'true' or 'false' value, but this 'isMarried' variable
97

97

00:04:54.784  -->  00:04:57.818
is already a Boolean; right now it is set to 'false',
98

98

00:04:57.818  -->  00:05:01.532
but we could also set it to 'true', so let's do that.
99

99

00:05:01.532  -->  00:05:04.365
Again, what we want here is a true/false value,
100

100

00:05:04.365  -->  00:05:07.474
but 'isMarried' is already 'true', it is already a Boolean,
101

101

00:05:07.474  -->  00:05:10.737
so this part is not even necessary.
102

102

00:05:10.737  -->  00:05:12.414
Does that make sense?
103

103

00:05:12.414  -->  00:05:14.641
Here, we just need a true/false value, again,
104

104

00:05:14.641  -->  00:05:16.707
so no need to write the 'true'.
105

105

00:05:16.707  -->  00:05:19.495 line:15% 
Let's test that, and now it says 'John is married!' here,
106

106

00:05:19.495  -->  00:05:22.646
coming from line 173, so this one here.
107

107

00:05:22.646  -->  00:05:25.722
Of course, this one here is still coming from
108

108

00:05:25.722  -->  00:05:27.749
this 'if / else' statement from before
109

109

00:05:27.749  -->  00:05:29.370
where we say that the civil status
110

110

00:05:29.370  -->  00:05:31.483
is 'single' and not 'married'.
111

111

00:05:31.483  -->  00:05:34.270
This here is just another example where I wanted to show you
112

112

00:05:34.270  -->  00:05:37.650
that it's actually enough to pass a 'true' or 'false' value
113

113

00:05:37.650  -->  00:05:40.455
here into this condition.
114

114

00:05:40.455  -->  00:05:43.137
I hope that makes sense, and that you now learned
115

115

00:05:43.137  -->  00:05:46.329
how we can make decisions using code.
116

116

00:05:46.329  -->  00:05:48.743
Of course, we could do much more difficult
117

117

00:05:48.743  -->  00:05:51.365
and much more complex stuff into these blocks,
118

118

00:05:51.365  -->  00:05:54.359
the 'if' block or the 'else' block.
119

119

00:05:54.359  -->  00:05:56.742
Now, just to finish this lecture,
120

120

00:05:56.742  -->  00:05:59.856
let's bring back the code from our coding challenge
121

121

00:05:59.856  -->  00:06:03.520
that we coded up before, and let's basically
122

122

00:06:03.520  -->  00:06:06.687
write something better to the console.
123

123

00:06:09.602  -->  00:06:12.805
What we did here is to simply log this string here,
124

124

00:06:12.805  -->  00:06:16.286
then together with this true/false value.
125

125

00:06:16.286  -->  00:06:18.413
That's not really the best solution, right,
126

126

00:06:18.413  -->  00:06:21.228
to just print true/false to the console?
127

127

00:06:21.228  -->  00:06:23.040
Now that you know the 'if / else' statement,
128

128

00:06:23.040  -->  00:06:26.722
we can do a lot better than this, right?
129

129

00:06:26.722  -->  00:06:28.532
What we can do, instead of all of this,
130

130

00:06:28.532  -->  00:06:31.199
let's comment it out actually...
131

131

00:06:32.381  -->  00:06:34.131
...is to write 'if...
132

132

00:06:35.556  -->  00:06:37.556
...BMIMark is greater...
133

133

00:06:38.905  -->  00:06:40.322
...than BMIJohn'.
134

134

00:06:41.830  -->  00:06:45.344
Well in this case we want to print something to the console,
135

135

00:06:45.344  -->  00:06:49.261
and if not, then we want to log something else.
136

136

00:06:54.421  -->  00:06:57.611
In this case, we have of course 'Mark's',
137

137

00:06:57.611  -->  00:07:00.028
and now, the escape string...
138

138

00:07:05.423  -->  00:07:09.006
...'than, John's', and of course, escaping.
139

139

00:07:12.244  -->  00:07:16.827
Let's copy it, and so here it's the other way around...
140

140

00:07:18.916  -->  00:07:20.916
...'higher than Mark's'.
141

141

00:07:22.811  -->  00:07:25.930
Let's quickly recap what we did here.
142

142

00:07:25.930  -->  00:07:30.779
So, we're testing if the BMI of Mark is greater than John's.
143

143

00:07:30.779  -->  00:07:32.655
This here, of course, as you already know,
144

144

00:07:32.655  -->  00:07:35.618
will return a 'true' or 'false' value, and that is exactly
145

145

00:07:35.618  -->  00:07:38.035
what we need in an 'if / else' statement.
146

146

00:07:38.035  -->  00:07:40.410
In this case, it will then log to the console
147

147

00:07:40.410  -->  00:07:43.955
'Mark's BMI is higher than John's', and if it's not,
148

148

00:07:43.955  -->  00:07:46.264
so if this here is 'false', then of course
149

149

00:07:46.264  -->  00:07:48.775
John's BMI must be higher than Mark's,
150

150

00:07:48.775  -->  00:07:52.984
and so then that's exactly what we log to the console.
151

151

00:07:52.984  -->  00:07:56.107
Now just to test it out, we say
152

152

00:07:56.107  -->  00:07:59.264 line:15% 
'Mark's BMI is higher than John's'.
153

153

00:07:59.264  -->  00:08:01.451
It's missing the 's', but that doesn't really matter,
154

154

00:08:01.451  -->  00:08:04.700
and just to test the other scenario let's quickly increase
155

155

00:08:04.700  -->  00:08:08.583
this mass here, and so now John's should be larger,
156

156

00:08:08.583  -->  00:08:12.833 line:15% 
and indeed, now 'John's BMI is higher than Mark's'.
157

157

00:08:14.496  -->  00:08:16.140
Putting it back, and so now again
158

158

00:08:16.140  -->  00:08:19.771 line:15% 
Mark's would be higher, and indeed it is working.
159

159

00:08:19.771  -->  00:08:22.606
Now you know how to take decisions with code.
160

160

00:08:22.606  -->  00:08:25.230
That's awesome, but this is really just the fundamentals
161

161

00:08:25.230  -->  00:08:28.375
of conditionals and decision taking with code,
162

162

00:08:28.375  -->  00:08:31.111
so there's a lot more to learn.
163

163

00:08:31.111  -->  00:08:33.694
