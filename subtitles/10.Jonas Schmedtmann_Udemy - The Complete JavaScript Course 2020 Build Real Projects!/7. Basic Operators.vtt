00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:02.003
<v Jonas>Let's now learn</v>
2

2

00:00:02.003  -->  00:00:05.030
about a couple of basic JavaScript operators.
3

3

00:00:05.030  -->  00:00:08.110
So, here I already created the title for this lecture,
4

4

00:00:08.110  -->  00:00:11.570
and also commented out the code here off the last lecture.
5

5

00:00:11.570  -->  00:00:15.140
Okay, so we can actually do this here in different files,
6

6

00:00:15.140  -->  00:00:17.010
like one file for each lecture.
7

7

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:20.230
But I prefer to just keep it everything simple here
8

8

00:00:20.230  -->  00:00:21.550
all in one file.
9

9

00:00:21.550  -->  00:00:23.440
Now, for operators, they can be
10

10

00:00:23.440  -->  00:00:25.510
for example, the simple math operators
11

11

00:00:25.510  -->  00:00:26.370
that we already know,
12

12

00:00:26.370  -->  00:00:28.980
like plus and minus and times.
13

13

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:29.970
And then beside that,
14

14

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:32.310
in JavaScript we have a couple of other operators
15

15

00:00:32.310  -->  00:00:34.060
that I'm also gonna show you.
16

16

00:00:34.060  -->  00:00:36.820
So in simple terms, operators are like functions
17

17

00:00:36.820  -->  00:00:39.220
that are written in a special way in JavaScript.
18

18

00:00:39.220  -->  00:00:41.140
And in case you're wondering what functions are,
19

19

00:00:41.140  -->  00:00:42.290
don't worry.
20

20

00:00:42.290  -->  00:00:44.191
Again, we will talk about this a bit later.
21

21

00:00:44.191  -->  00:00:47.730
But from now on, let's actually look at some math operators
22

22

00:00:47.730  -->  00:00:49.880
and how we can use them in JavaScript.
23

23

00:00:49.880  -->  00:00:53.080
So let's calculate in what year John was born,
24

24

00:00:53.080  -->  00:00:54.230
and that's very simple.
25

25

00:00:56.270  -->  00:00:57.620
So, let's call it yearJohn.
26

26

00:00:58.910  -->  00:01:01.460
So we have 2018, which is the current year,
27

27

00:01:01.460  -->  00:01:03.455
minus John's age, right?
28

28

00:01:03.455  -->  00:01:06.920
And remember we declared it as 28,
29

29

00:01:06.920  -->  00:01:09.087
so let's use the same here.
30

30

00:01:09.087  -->  00:01:11.237
And so now we can analog it to the console.
31

31

00:01:15.190  -->  00:01:17.290
So let's take a look at that.
32

32

00:01:17.290  -->  00:01:19.440
And indeed, 1990.
33

33

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:23.680
So this here, the minus, is a math operator in JavaScript.
34

34

00:01:23.680  -->  00:01:25.300
And let's now do the same for,
35

35

00:01:25.300  -->  00:01:26.830
let's say for someone else.
36

36

00:01:26.830  -->  00:01:28.230
Like John's friend,
37

37

00:01:30.220  -->  00:01:32.280
let's say he's called Mark.
38

38

00:01:32.280  -->  00:01:35.500
And so 2018 minus 33.
39

39

00:01:35.500  -->  00:01:37.780
So mark is 33 years old.
40

40

00:01:37.780  -->  00:01:38.850
And now you see that we are starting
41

41

00:01:38.850  -->  00:01:40.400
to repeat some of the value.
42

42

00:01:40.400  -->  00:01:42.280
So, for example, 2018 here,
43

43

00:01:42.280  -->  00:01:44.210
we are using it multiple times,
44

44

00:01:44.210  -->  00:01:47.010
and so let's declare it as a separate variable.
45

45

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:50.020
So that is what variables are for, okay.
46

46

00:01:50.020  -->  00:01:55.020
So we can say var year is 2018.
47

47

00:01:55.640  -->  00:01:59.000
And so now instead of having to reuse this 2018 here,
48

48

00:01:59.000  -->  00:02:03.240
we can then right year in these two places.
49

49

00:02:03.240  -->  00:02:05.870
Okay, so let's take a look at that.
50

50

00:02:05.870  -->  00:02:08.880
And of course, it still displays the exact same number.
51

51

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:10.970
But if we wanted to change the year now,
52

52

00:02:10.970  -->  00:02:12.053
let's say to 2020,
53

53

00:02:12.053  -->  00:02:13.380
well then we wouldn't have
54

54

00:02:13.380  -->  00:02:16.690
to change it here in these two places like we had before.
55

55

00:02:16.690  -->  00:02:18.840
So before, if we wanted to change the year,
56

56

00:02:18.840  -->  00:02:20.930
we would have to change it both here and here,
57

57

00:02:20.930  -->  00:02:22.210
and that is something that we always
58

58

00:02:22.210  -->  00:02:23.610
want to avoid in programming.
59

59

00:02:23.610  -->  00:02:25.840
And so we defined this year in one place,
60

60

00:02:25.840  -->  00:02:29.070
and then it gets used in these two places here.
61

61

00:02:29.070  -->  00:02:29.903
Okay?
62

62

00:02:29.903  -->  00:02:31.093
And actually let's also declare
63

63

00:02:31.093  -->  00:02:33.850
all of these variables here in the same line
64

64

00:02:33.850  -->  00:02:35.500
like I showed you before.
65

65

00:02:35.500  -->  00:02:38.310
So year, then yearJohn,
66

66

00:02:40.800  -->  00:02:41.890
and yearMark,
67

67

00:02:43.550  -->  00:02:45.440
and then we move this vars from here,
68

68

00:02:45.440  -->  00:02:47.830
so this just looks a bit better.
69

69

00:02:47.830  -->  00:02:50.090
So that is just the minus operator here,
70

70

00:02:50.090  -->  00:02:52.440
but of course we can do all kinds of math here.
71

71

00:02:54.980  -->  00:02:58.828
So for example, we can multiplications.
72

72

00:02:58.828  -->  00:03:01.900
So let's say we wanted to add two years here.
73

73

00:03:02.923  -->  00:03:06.000
And so, "now" is not defined.
74

74

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:09.090
So this is of course not now, but it's year.
75

75

00:03:09.090  -->  00:03:10.740
Well actually this should be called now
76

76

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:12.710
because now is the current year.
77

77

00:03:13.720  -->  00:03:15.300
So 2018.
78

78

00:03:15.300  -->  00:03:18.420
So what we want here is for this to be called now.
79

79

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:20.700
And also here, and here.
80

80

00:03:22.100  -->  00:03:25.470
Alright, and so let's take a look at what happens then.
81

81

00:03:25.470  -->  00:03:27.520
And indeed, it logs 2020 to the console,
82

82

00:03:27.520  -->  00:03:29.976
which is 2018 plus two, right?
83

83

00:03:29.976  -->  00:03:32.060
Of course we can also multiply.
84

84

00:03:33.160  -->  00:03:35.700
So let's say now, times two.
85

85

00:03:36.570  -->  00:03:38.850
And we can of course also divide.
86

86

00:03:38.850  -->  00:03:41.660
So let's divide by 10 here, alright.
87

87

00:03:41.660  -->  00:03:43.210
Logging it all to the console.
88

88

00:03:43.210  -->  00:03:46.960
Well, then of course we see that this is 2018 times two.
89

89

00:03:46.960  -->  00:03:49.150
And this is 2018 here divided by 10,
90

90

00:03:49.150  -->  00:03:51.730
and so we end up with this decimal number here.
91

91

00:03:51.730  -->  00:03:53.030
Okay.
92

92

00:03:53.030  -->  00:03:57.260
So these are the math operators that we used here.
93

93

00:03:57.260  -->  00:03:59.260
So let's add a comment here saying that.
94

94

00:04:00.860  -->  00:04:04.210
And now I'm going to show you some logical operators.
95

95

00:04:04.210  -->  00:04:06.010
So let's write it down here as well.
96

96

00:04:07.910  -->  00:04:10.330
And so let's say that we wanted to compare the age
97

97

00:04:10.330  -->  00:04:12.740
of Mark and John and figure out if,
98

98

00:04:12.740  -->  00:04:15.410
for example, John is older than Mark.
99

99

00:04:15.410  -->  00:04:17.920
And so for that we can use a logical operator.
100

100

00:04:17.920  -->  00:04:21.640
So first of all, let's actually define these ages here
101

101

00:04:21.640  -->  00:04:23.040
as different variables.
102

102

00:04:24.600  -->  00:04:27.010
So ageJohn is 28,
103

103

00:04:27.970  -->  00:04:30.420
and then ageMark is 33.
104

104

00:04:31.950  -->  00:04:34.250
And so, of course, here we use ageJohn
105

105

00:04:34.250  -->  00:04:36.470
and then down here ageMark.
106

106

00:04:37.350  -->  00:04:39.860
So, let's create a new variable here
107

107

00:04:39.860  -->  00:04:42.260
called var johnOlder.
108

108

00:04:44.150  -->  00:04:49.150
And then we will say ageJohn greater than ageMark, okay.
109

109

00:04:51.970  -->  00:04:54.370
And then, of course, we need to log it to the console here
110

110

00:04:54.370  -->  00:04:55.820
to see our results.
111

111

00:05:00.030  -->  00:05:02.640
And so let's take a look at what happens now.
112

112

00:05:02.640  -->  00:05:06.430
And we see our result is this boolean, and it's false, okay.
113

113

00:05:06.430  -->  00:05:08.910
And so what this means is that ageJohn,
114

114

00:05:08.910  -->  00:05:10.710
which is 28 here,
115

115

00:05:10.710  -->  00:05:14.960
is, of course, less than ageMark which is 33.
116

116

00:05:14.960  -->  00:05:17.190
So basically here we asked the question,
117

117

00:05:17.190  -->  00:05:20.110
"Is ageJohn greater than ageMark?"
118

118

00:05:20.110  -->  00:05:22.640
and the result of that is false.
119

119

00:05:22.640  -->  00:05:25.120
Okay, and so our johnOlder variable here
120

120

00:05:25.120  -->  00:05:26.480
turns out to be false.
121

121

00:05:26.480  -->  00:05:28.140
Now, if it was the other way around.
122

122

00:05:28.140  -->  00:05:32.080
If we asked, ageJohn less than ageMark.
123

123

00:05:32.080  -->  00:05:34.900
Well, then it should be the other way around.
124

124

00:05:34.900  -->  00:05:37.560
And so yeah, indeed it is now true.
125

125

00:05:37.560  -->  00:05:42.560
Again, because ageMark is 33 which is more than 28.
126

126

00:05:42.630  -->  00:05:44.160
And so we have a way now
127

127

00:05:44.160  -->  00:05:46.930
of basically creating a boolean variable
128

128

00:05:46.930  -->  00:05:50.000
using one of the logical operators that I just showed you.
129

129

00:05:50.000  -->  00:05:52.340
And there are many more that we're gonna explore
130

130

00:05:52.340  -->  00:05:54.190
a bit later in the course, and actually
131

131

00:05:54.190  -->  00:05:56.480
in this section in a couple of videos.
132

132

00:05:56.480  -->  00:05:59.690
So, math operators here are pretty straightforward.
133

133

00:05:59.690  -->  00:06:01.330
Then, these logical operators,
134

134

00:06:01.330  -->  00:06:03.400
which are also very important,
135

135

00:06:03.400  -->  00:06:05.930
as you're going to see later throughout the course.
136

136

00:06:05.930  -->  00:06:06.910
And then, before we leave,
137

137

00:06:06.910  -->  00:06:09.553
I also want to show you the typeof operator.
138

138

00:06:12.850  -->  00:06:14.690
Okay, and this operator is a bit different
139

139

00:06:14.690  -->  00:06:15.750
than the other ones.
140

140

00:06:15.750  -->  00:06:18.050
So, the ones that we used up until this point
141

141

00:06:18.050  -->  00:06:21.610
always required two things to compare
142

142

00:06:21.610  -->  00:06:23.330
or to add or to multiply.
143

143

00:06:23.330  -->  00:06:26.900
So now times two, or now divided by 10,
144

144

00:06:26.900  -->  00:06:29.890
or ageJohn less than ageMark.
145

145

00:06:29.890  -->  00:06:32.170
So we always had two operons.
146

146

00:06:32.170  -->  00:06:35.240
But with the typeof operator, we only have one.
147

147

00:06:35.240  -->  00:06:36.690
So let me show it to you.
148

148

00:06:36.690  -->  00:06:38.194
So let's log to the console
149

149

00:06:38.194  -->  00:06:41.620
the result of using the type of operator
150

150

00:06:41.620  -->  00:06:44.040
on, let's say, the johnOlder variable.
151

151

00:06:44.941  -->  00:06:48.290
Okay, and so basically what this will do
152

152

00:06:48.290  -->  00:06:51.100
is to tell us the type of this variable.
153

153

00:06:51.100  -->  00:06:53.100
And so indeed, we get boolean.
154

154

00:06:53.100  -->  00:06:57.210
And that's because obviously this is a boolean variable.
155

155

00:06:57.210  -->  00:07:00.250
So we saw it here as it returned this true.
156

156

00:07:00.250  -->  00:07:02.470
And as we learned in one of the last lectures,
157

157

00:07:02.470  -->  00:07:05.407
a true or false value is always a boolean.
158

158

00:07:05.407  -->  00:07:06.670
Right, remember that?
159

159

00:07:08.520  -->  00:07:11.450
So let's try it out with some other stuff here.
160

160

00:07:12.830  -->  00:07:16.030
So typeof ageJohn, and let's now say ageJohn,
161

161

00:07:16.030  -->  00:07:17.930
and this should be a number.
162

162

00:07:17.930  -->  00:07:20.190
And indeed, it is.
163

163

00:07:21.850  -->  00:07:23.160
Let's actually copy this now,
164

164

00:07:23.160  -->  00:07:26.270
and let's try it out with a string,
165

165

00:07:26.270  -->  00:07:27.260
and we don't have any here.
166

166

00:07:27.260  -->  00:07:29.150
So let's just write it ourselves.
167

167

00:07:30.010  -->  00:07:33.220
Mark is older than John, for example.
168

168

00:07:33.220  -->  00:07:36.580
And then also, let's try something else.
169

169

00:07:36.580  -->  00:07:39.230
So let's just declare a random variable here
170

170

00:07:39.230  -->  00:07:40.640
and not define it.
171

171

00:07:40.640  -->  00:07:44.360
And then, let's log to the console the type of this.
172

172

00:07:44.360  -->  00:07:47.340
And so what do you expect that the type of x will be.
173

173

00:07:48.490  -->  00:07:49.750
So let's test it,
174

174

00:07:49.750  -->  00:07:52.730
and I hope you know that it will be undefined.
175

175

00:07:53.710  -->  00:07:55.180
Okay, so that makes sense
176

176

00:07:55.180  -->  00:07:58.550
because, indeed, we did not define any value
177

177

00:07:58.550  -->  00:08:00.210
for the x variable.
178

178

00:08:00.210  -->  00:08:03.090
And the one before here, of course, is a string.
179

179

00:08:03.090  -->  00:08:05.220
So this may not seem like a big deal to you here,
180

180

00:08:05.220  -->  00:08:06.190
this operator.
181

181

00:08:06.190  -->  00:08:09.283
But actually you will see that we will use this here
182

182

00:08:09.283  -->  00:08:13.090
in the future, and actually also later in this section.
183

183

00:08:13.090  -->  00:08:16.670
Okay, so this is the very basics of JavaScript operators.
184

184

00:08:16.670  -->  00:08:19.740
Now in the next lecture, we will keep working with operators
185

185

00:08:19.740  -->  00:08:21.250
where I'm gonna show you some more,
186

186

00:08:21.250  -->  00:08:22.820
let's say, advanced stuff.
187

187

00:08:22.820  -->  00:08:25.570
So don't wait and come with me right to the next video.
