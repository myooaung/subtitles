00:00:01.120  -->  00:00:03.250
<v ->Now before we can use the exciting tools</v>
2

2

00:00:03.250  -->  00:00:04.920
that I showed you in the last lecture,
3

3

00:00:04.920  -->  00:00:07.470
we need to learn a bit about the command line.
4

4

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:09.210
Yeah, you heard that right.
5

5

00:00:09.210  -->  00:00:11.770
These tools only work in the command line.
6

6

00:00:11.770  -->  00:00:13.480
And so now comes the time where
7

7

00:00:13.480  -->  00:00:15.270
you finally have to learn about it,
8

8

00:00:15.270  -->  00:00:17.350
at least the basics like moving around
9

9

00:00:17.350  -->  00:00:19.820
in the file system, creating files and folders,
10

10

00:00:19.820  -->  00:00:22.110
copying files and stuff like that.
11

11

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:24.400
And I know that many, many people are afraid
12

12

00:00:24.400  -->  00:00:26.680
of the command line for some reason, and
13

13

00:00:26.680  -->  00:00:28.640
I was afraid myself some years ago.
14

14

00:00:28.640  -->  00:00:29.490
I admit it.
15

15

00:00:29.490  -->  00:00:31.390
But now I love the command line
16

16

00:00:31.390  -->  00:00:33.780
and I really can't live without it really.
17

17

00:00:33.780  -->  00:00:36.080
And so can't any serious web developer.
18

18

00:00:36.080  -->  00:00:38.590
It's just part of the job, okay?
19

19

00:00:38.590  -->  00:00:40.440
Now if you already know this stuff
20

20

00:00:40.440  -->  00:00:43.180
then please feel free to move on to the next lecture
21

21

00:00:43.180  -->  00:00:45.770
as you probably are not gonna learn anything new here.
22

22

00:00:45.770  -->  00:00:47.993
But for the rest of us, let's get to it.
23

23

00:00:49.300  -->  00:00:51.240
Now the command line works a bit differently
24

24

00:00:51.240  -->  00:00:54.370
whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
25

25

00:00:54.370  -->  00:00:56.350
So on a Mac, it is called terminal,
26

26

00:00:56.350  -->  00:01:01.350
and so let's open it up by opening up the terminal app.
27

27

00:01:01.430  -->  00:01:05.350
Make it a bit bigger so you can actually see me typing.
28

28

00:01:05.350  -->  00:01:06.870
And that should be okay.
29

29

00:01:06.870  -->  00:01:09.900
Now on Windows the command line is called command prompt,
30

30

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:13.130
and you can open it up by right-clicking on the start button
31

31

00:01:13.130  -->  00:01:15.443
and from there choose the command prompt.
32

32

00:01:16.370  -->  00:01:18.560
Now the commands are also a bit different
33

33

00:01:18.560  -->  00:01:22.283
on Windows and on Unix, which is Linux and Mac.
34

34

00:01:23.158  -->  00:01:26.920
So here I'm gonna type the ones for Linux and Mac,
35

35

00:01:26.920  -->  00:01:28.820
but I'm gonna tell you the ones for Windows
36

36

00:01:28.820  -->  00:01:30.810
as we go so that if you're on Windows,
37

37

00:01:30.810  -->  00:01:33.080
you can follow this video as well.
38

38

00:01:33.080  -->  00:01:36.230
So that being said, the main concept of the command line
39

39

00:01:36.230  -->  00:01:38.420
is that we're always in a folder.
40

40

00:01:38.420  -->  00:01:40.600
And right now I'm here in the home folder and
41

41

00:01:40.600  -->  00:01:44.417
I can see the contents of this folder by running ls.
42

42

00:01:44.417  -->  00:01:47.600
And on Windows it's called dir which stands for directory.
43

43

00:01:47.600  -->  00:01:51.900
So, like this, but on the Mac and Linux for that matter
44

44

00:01:51.900  -->  00:01:54.400
it is called ls, which is for list.
45

45

00:01:54.400  -->  00:01:58.370
So in my home directory, I have these eight folders here.
46

46

00:01:58.370  -->  00:02:00.330
And now I can actually move into these folders.
47

47

00:02:00.330  -->  00:02:02.130
So in the command line I can use commands
48

48

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:05.933
to move up and down in my folder structure.
49

49

00:02:05.933  -->  00:02:08.080
So I'm on the desktop now and so let's say
50

50

00:02:08.080  -->  00:02:10.290
we want to get into the desktop
51

51

00:02:10.290  -->  00:02:12.670
because that's where the project folder is.
52

52

00:02:12.670  -->  00:02:16.360
So you see, here on my desktop is where I have this folder
53

53

00:02:16.360  -->  00:02:18.640
for the project that we're gonna work on in this section.
54

54

00:02:18.640  -->  00:02:20.560
And so now here in the command line
55

55

00:02:20.560  -->  00:02:22.990
I can also move into that folder.
56

56

00:02:22.990  -->  00:02:27.400
In order to do that I have to use cd, so change directory.
57

57

00:02:27.400  -->  00:02:29.670
And this one is actually the same on Windows.
58

58

00:02:29.670  -->  00:02:32.913
So I write cd and then I write desktop.
59

59

00:02:34.240  -->  00:02:37.600
Hit return, and now I'm in the desktop folder.
60

60

00:02:37.600  -->  00:02:39.290
And you actually can see it here.
61

61

00:02:39.290  -->  00:02:41.140
So it changed here from this home folder
62

62

00:02:41.140  -->  00:02:44.630
which is what this here means to the desktop folder
63

63

00:02:44.630  -->  00:02:46.670
which is now the current folder or
64

64

00:02:46.670  -->  00:02:48.343
the current working directory.
65

65

00:02:49.990  -->  00:02:54.140
So I can do ls again or dir on Windows remember.
66

66

00:02:54.140  -->  00:02:57.060
And now I see the contents of the folder.
67

67

00:02:57.060  -->  00:03:00.550
Now to move into this one here again I use cd.
68

68

00:03:00.550  -->  00:03:03.000
And then I can write the name of the folder.
69

69

00:03:03.000  -->  00:03:04.890
Now if I start writing it like this,
70

70

00:03:04.890  -->  00:03:08.610
then I can also hit the tab and it will then automatically
71

71

00:03:08.610  -->  00:03:10.910
complete the rest of the path for me because
72

72

00:03:10.910  -->  00:03:14.290
if I started writing 9 f then there's really
73

73

00:03:14.290  -->  00:03:16.410
no other path here that it could be
74

74

00:03:16.410  -->  00:03:18.290
and so automatically the command line
75

75

00:03:18.290  -->  00:03:20.650
knows that this is what I'm trying to write.
76

76

00:03:20.650  -->  00:03:22.930
Now if you have some folder names that are similar
77

77

00:03:22.930  -->  00:03:25.170
in the beginning, then you have to write the name
78

78

00:03:25.170  -->  00:03:27.830
of the folder until it is different from all the others.
79

79

00:03:27.830  -->  00:03:29.260
And only then you can hit the
80

80

00:03:29.260  -->  00:03:31.393
tab button in order to auto-complete.
81

81

00:03:32.490  -->  00:03:35.720
So now I'm in the forkify folder here,
82

82

00:03:35.720  -->  00:03:39.050
let's use ls again and so you see
83

83

00:03:39.050  -->  00:03:41.920
the dist and source folder that I showed you before.
84

84

00:03:41.920  -->  00:03:45.270
Now if you actually wanted to move up, we can also do that.
85

85

00:03:45.270  -->  00:03:48.013
And again we use cd and then we use dot dot.
86

86

00:03:49.050  -->  00:03:52.410
So dot dot always means the folder above.
87

87

00:03:52.410  -->  00:03:54.440
We are in the forkify folder now
88

88

00:03:54.440  -->  00:03:56.360
and if I execute this command,
89

89

00:03:56.360  -->  00:03:58.193
then we're back in the desktop.
90

90

00:03:59.690  -->  00:04:01.790
But let's actually move back into it.
91

91

00:04:01.790  -->  00:04:03.550
And if you don't want to repeat the same command
92

92

00:04:03.550  -->  00:04:05.560
that we wrote before, we can use the up and down
93

93

00:04:05.560  -->  00:04:07.795
arrow keys on the keyboard in order to
94

94

00:04:07.795  -->  00:04:10.310
run through the commands that we wrote before.
95

95

00:04:10.310  -->  00:04:11.490
So, just like this.
96

96

00:04:11.490  -->  00:04:14.473
So you see all of the commands that I wrote before.
97

97

00:04:15.590  -->  00:04:17.210
This is the one that we want to
98

98

00:04:17.210  -->  00:04:19.950
move back into the forkify folder, right?
99

99

00:04:19.950  -->  00:04:22.300
Ls just to make sure that
100

100

00:04:22.300  -->  00:04:24.700
we have the right folder names here.
101

101

00:04:24.700  -->  00:04:27.350
Now this is now getting a bit cluttered here and
102

102

00:04:27.350  -->  00:04:31.013
so we can actually clear this up by writing simply clear.
103

103

00:04:32.040  -->  00:04:34.910
At least here in a Mac command line.
104

104

00:04:34.910  -->  00:04:36.760
On Windows you have to write cls.
105

105

00:04:36.760  -->  00:04:38.363
So cls like this.
106

106

00:04:39.660  -->  00:04:40.960
So I write clear and then
107

107

00:04:40.960  -->  00:04:45.710
I am back to having this clear command line.
108

108

00:04:45.710  -->  00:04:47.720
Let's now actually make a new folder here
109

109

00:04:47.720  -->  00:04:52.120
in this forkify folder, so I'm writing mkdir,
110

110

00:04:52.120  -->  00:04:54.040
which stands for make directory.
111

111

00:04:54.040  -->  00:04:56.740
And again, this one is the same on Windows.
112

112

00:04:56.740  -->  00:04:58.453
So let me call this one here test.
113

113

00:04:59.790  -->  00:05:02.620
And so now we should see that we have three folders
114

114

00:05:02.620  -->  00:05:04.500
so dist, source, and test.
115

115

00:05:04.500  -->  00:05:07.360
And we can confirm this by opening up the folder here
116

116

00:05:07.360  -->  00:05:09.930
in the explorer and here it is.
117

117

00:05:09.930  -->  00:05:13.393
Here is the folder that we just created in the command line.
118

118

00:05:14.440  -->  00:05:19.440
Now moving into that folder, so cd test, we can now create
119

119

00:05:20.350  -->  00:05:23.470
a new file in here also using the command line.
120

120

00:05:23.470  -->  00:05:27.010
So on Mac and Linux the command is called touch
121

121

00:05:27.010  -->  00:05:29.840
and then the name of the file that we want to create.
122

122

00:05:29.840  -->  00:05:32.700
So let's say I want to create test.js.
123

123

00:05:32.700  -->  00:05:35.930
Now on Windows it is a bit different, so
124

124

00:05:35.930  -->  00:05:37.559
let me tell you how it is on Windows.
125

125

00:05:37.559  -->  00:05:41.200
On Windows we have to write copy null
126

126

00:05:41.200  -->  00:05:43.540
and then the file name.
127

127

00:05:43.540  -->  00:05:46.450
Let's say also test.js.
128

128

00:05:46.450  -->  00:05:48.270
And this is actually only with one l,
129

129

00:05:48.270  -->  00:05:51.403
so this is not a mistake, it's not two "l"s, not like this.
130

130

00:05:51.403  -->  00:05:53.163
It's actually just like this.
131

131

00:05:54.120  -->  00:05:57.850
So it sounds a bit weird, maybe, but this is how it works.
132

132

00:05:57.850  -->  00:06:00.700
So that's on Windows of course I'm not gonna execute it here
133

133

00:06:00.700  -->  00:06:02.370
so I'm just gonna get rid of it.
134

134

00:06:02.370  -->  00:06:06.080
But right now here if I'm in this test folder and do ls,
135

135

00:06:06.080  -->  00:06:09.690
I'm going to see this newly created file in here.
136

136

00:06:09.690  -->  00:06:10.810
Let's create another one.
137

137

00:06:10.810  -->  00:06:12.963
Touch jonas.js.
138

138

00:06:14.460  -->  00:06:17.810
And indeed now both of them are here.
139

139

00:06:17.810  -->  00:06:22.200
And again I can confirm this here of course in the explorer.
140

140

00:06:22.200  -->  00:06:24.570
So jonas and test.js.
141

141

00:06:24.570  -->  00:06:26.040
Nice.
142

142

00:06:26.040  -->  00:06:28.260
So what can we do now next?
143

143

00:06:28.260  -->  00:06:32.123
Well, let's copy jonas.js into the main folder.
144

144

00:06:32.974  -->  00:06:34.480
So how can you do that?
145

145

00:06:34.480  -->  00:06:36.020
Well it's actually very easy.
146

146

00:06:36.020  -->  00:06:38.220
We just need to use the cp command.
147

147

00:06:38.220  -->  00:06:40.580
And on Windows it's simply called copy.
148

148

00:06:40.580  -->  00:06:41.653
So just like this.
149

149

00:06:42.770  -->  00:06:46.490
So cp, the name of the file, jonas.js,
150

150

00:06:46.490  -->  00:06:48.200
and then the directory.
151

151

00:06:48.200  -->  00:06:50.880
And I want to copy it into the parent folder,
152

152

00:06:50.880  -->  00:06:53.530
and remember how we write the parent folder,
153

153

00:06:53.530  -->  00:06:57.190
well, just these two dots, right?
154

154

00:06:57.190  -->  00:06:58.970
So, let's execute it.
155

155

00:06:58.970  -->  00:07:03.363
Move up into the forkify folder and then let's check it out.
156

156

00:07:04.200  -->  00:07:06.920
And indeed, we have dist, source, and test folders
157

157

00:07:06.920  -->  00:07:10.063
and then the jonas.js file that I just copied here.
158

158

00:07:11.500  -->  00:07:12.880
So again I'm gonna confirm it and
159

159

00:07:12.880  -->  00:07:14.990
here it is and of course it's still here
160

160

00:07:14.990  -->  00:07:17.553
because we didn't move it, we did copy it.
161

161

00:07:19.700  -->  00:07:22.950
And since we're talking about moving, let's then go back
162

162

00:07:22.950  -->  00:07:25.040
into this folder and move the other file
163

163

00:07:25.040  -->  00:07:27.513
out of the test folder into the home folder.
164

164

00:07:28.660  -->  00:07:32.000
So, cd into test and now to move
165

165

00:07:32.000  -->  00:07:36.023
we use the mv command on the Mac and on Windows, just move.
166

166

00:07:36.960  -->  00:07:41.050
So mv, the test file, and actually this also works
167

167

00:07:41.050  -->  00:07:44.020
with files, so I can simply hit the tab key
168

168

00:07:44.020  -->  00:07:47.000
and it auto-completes the file name here as well.
169

169

00:07:47.000  -->  00:07:51.661
So mv test.js to the parent folder so dot dot again,
170

170

00:07:51.661  -->  00:07:53.140
and here we go.
171

171

00:07:53.140  -->  00:07:55.370
Now if I do ls here now we should
172

172

00:07:55.370  -->  00:07:58.449
only have the jonas.js file left.
173

173

00:07:58.449  -->  00:08:01.860
And indeed here we go, and if you go up,
174

174

00:08:01.860  -->  00:08:04.543
well you already know that it worked, I'm sure,
175

175

00:08:05.650  -->  00:08:09.800
and indeed now test and jonas.js are both here.
176

176

00:08:09.800  -->  00:08:12.550
So that's how we create folders and files
177

177

00:08:12.550  -->  00:08:13.940
and copy and move them.
178

178

00:08:13.940  -->  00:08:15.510
Now as a final step, let's also
179

179

00:08:15.510  -->  00:08:17.560
learn how to delete these files.
180

180

00:08:17.560  -->  00:08:22.560
So from here I'm going to delete jonas.js and test.js.
181

181

00:08:22.950  -->  00:08:27.180
So in order to do that I'm going to use the rm command.
182

182

00:08:27.180  -->  00:08:30.580
So rm jonas.js, and again auto-complete,
183

183

00:08:30.580  -->  00:08:32.170
and then I can hit return.
184

184

00:08:32.170  -->  00:08:34.460
But be careful here, because this remove command
185

185

00:08:34.460  -->  00:08:36.480
will actually remove it permanently
186

186

00:08:36.480  -->  00:08:39.500
so it will not move it to the trash but instead
187

187

00:08:39.500  -->  00:08:42.250
it will delete it immediately from your hard drive
188

188

00:08:42.250  -->  00:08:43.430
and it's gone forever.
189

189

00:08:43.430  -->  00:08:47.060
So be really careful with this command, okay?
190

190

00:08:47.060  -->  00:08:50.480
And on Windows this one's actually called del so delete.
191

191

00:08:50.480  -->  00:08:54.290
So rm and I hit return and now it should be gone.
192

192

00:08:54.290  -->  00:08:57.240
Let's confirm it, and indeed it is gone.
193

193

00:08:57.240  -->  00:09:00.260
And actually I could have done both of them at the same time
194

194

00:09:00.260  -->  00:09:03.800
so jonas js and test js here in the same command
195

195

00:09:03.800  -->  00:09:07.340
but that's now simply do it separately with
196

196

00:09:07.340  -->  00:09:12.023
the test.js right now and so finally they are both gone.
197

197

00:09:13.027  -->  00:09:15.300
Now let's clear this command line again,
198

198

00:09:15.300  -->  00:09:20.010
move into the folder and then remove this file here as well.
199

199

00:09:20.010  -->  00:09:22.450
So this file, or actually we can do better.
200

200

00:09:22.450  -->  00:09:25.847
We can simply delete this entire folder containing the file,
201

201

00:09:25.847  -->  00:09:28.880
and this way I can also show you how to delete folders.
202

202

00:09:28.880  -->  00:09:30.180
So let's actually go back.
203

203

00:09:32.630  -->  00:09:34.240
Let's take a look here.
204

204

00:09:34.240  -->  00:09:38.180
And so we wanna get rid of this test folder.
205

205

00:09:38.180  -->  00:09:42.020
So on a Mac, you simply do rm again for remove,
206

206

00:09:42.020  -->  00:09:45.330
but then you have to use an option or a flag,
207

207

00:09:45.330  -->  00:09:48.080
which is the r, which stands for recursively.
208

208

00:09:48.080  -->  00:09:49.590
And this means that it will one by one
209

209

00:09:49.590  -->  00:09:51.390
delete all the files in the folder and
210

210

00:09:51.390  -->  00:09:53.030
then the folder as well.
211

211

00:09:53.030  -->  00:09:58.030
So rm minus r, which stands for the flag r, and then test.
212

212

00:09:58.840  -->  00:10:00.373
Now let's check it out.
213

213

00:10:01.440  -->  00:10:02.470
And now it's gone.
214

214

00:10:02.470  -->  00:10:04.810
Now on Windows, this works a bit differently.
215

215

00:10:04.810  -->  00:10:05.950
And it work like this.
216

216

00:10:05.950  -->  00:10:07.043
So it's rmdir,
217

217

00:10:09.535  -->  00:10:11.840
then slash S, and
218

218

00:10:11.840  -->  00:10:13.370
then the name of the directory.
219

219

00:10:13.370  -->  00:10:15.120
So it would be something like this.
220

220

00:10:16.960  -->  00:10:18.660
Not going to do that of course.
221

221

00:10:18.660  -->  00:10:21.900
So now we're back to the original state of our folder.
222

222

00:10:21.900  -->  00:10:24.090
Just one more thing that I want to show you is
223

223

00:10:24.090  -->  00:10:26.970
how to open files directly here from the command line.
224

224

00:10:26.970  -->  00:10:30.420
So let's move into the source folder, cd source.
225

225

00:10:30.420  -->  00:10:33.080
And in here should be the index.html file.
226

226

00:10:33.080  -->  00:10:33.913
Yeah.
227

227

00:10:33.913  -->  00:10:35.460
And so let's now actually open it,
228

228

00:10:35.460  -->  00:10:38.200
and it's as simple as using the open command.
229

229

00:10:38.200  -->  00:10:41.110
And on Windows you use start instead of open.
230

230

00:10:41.110  -->  00:10:43.920
Okay, so simply start just like this.
231

231

00:10:43.920  -->  00:10:47.220
So index, then tab to auto-complete, and now it should open
232

232

00:10:47.220  -->  00:10:50.240
in the default program which in this case is Google Chrome.
233

233

00:10:50.240  -->  00:10:51.890
So let's try it.
234

234

00:10:51.890  -->  00:10:52.723
And here we go.
235

235

00:10:52.723  -->  00:10:55.250
So that's the index.html file here.
236

236

00:10:55.250  -->  00:10:58.940
It's unstyled because it's not connected with the CSS,
237

237

00:10:58.940  -->  00:11:03.443
but, yeah, so it actually open up the file that we ask for.
238

238

00:11:05.890  -->  00:11:08.120
So, I think that's the really basics
239

239

00:11:08.120  -->  00:11:10.110
that I had to show you here with the terminal.
240

240

00:11:10.110  -->  00:11:12.560
So again this is really important stuff to learn
241

241

00:11:12.560  -->  00:11:14.680
because all the tools that we're gonna use next
242

242

00:11:14.680  -->  00:11:16.820
are run directly from the command line.
243

243

00:11:16.820  -->  00:11:19.590
So you really need to have some basics of course.
244

244

00:11:19.590  -->  00:11:23.550
So I hope this lecture gave you these basics
245

245

00:11:23.550  -->  00:11:26.373
and so let's now move on together right to the next one.
