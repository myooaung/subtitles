00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:03.710
<v Jonas>Let's now actually write our very first line</v>
2

2

00:00:03.710  -->  00:00:05.620
of JavaScript code.
3

3

00:00:05.620  -->  00:00:08.100
And here I am, in my text editor Brackets
4

4

00:00:08.100  -->  00:00:10.540
that we just set up in the last lecture.
5

5

00:00:10.540  -->  00:00:12.090
And I hope that you already downloaded
6

6

00:00:12.090  -->  00:00:13.940
the starter files from the course.
7

7

00:00:13.940  -->  00:00:16.270
I already have them here on my desktop.
8

8

00:00:16.270  -->  00:00:18.400
So it's in this folder here.
9

9

00:00:18.400  -->  00:00:21.750
And you see that here that I have the index.html file.
10

10

00:00:21.750  -->  00:00:22.640
Okay?
11

11

00:00:22.640  -->  00:00:25.660
And so going back to the Brackets text editor,
12

12

00:00:25.660  -->  00:00:28.180
all we have to do, in order to start a new project
13

13

00:00:28.180  -->  00:00:31.530
is to hit this button here and then click Open Folder
14

14

00:00:32.540  -->  00:00:35.360
and so the folder that I want as my project folder
15

15

00:00:35.360  -->  00:00:37.040
is this one here, okay?
16

16

00:00:37.040  -->  00:00:39.820
And so now all I have to do is to hit Open
17

17

00:00:39.820  -->  00:00:42.030
and so this is now the project folder
18

18

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:46.080
and it opened here this main, this index.html file.
19

19

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:48.730
So you see that this is here just a very bare bones
20

20

00:00:48.730  -->  00:00:52.500
HTML structure without any JavaScript in it at this point.
21

21

00:00:52.500  -->  00:00:53.333
Okay?
22

22

00:00:53.333  -->  00:00:55.130
And so let's now actually add some.
23

23

00:00:55.130  -->  00:00:56.160
Now, there are two ways
24

24

00:00:56.160  -->  00:00:59.050
in which we can add JavaScript to a website.
25

25

00:00:59.050  -->  00:01:01.580
And the first way is with inline scripts,
26

26

00:01:01.580  -->  00:01:05.050
and the second one is to add an external JavaScript file
27

27

00:01:05.050  -->  00:01:08.210
in which we can then add all of our JavaScript code.
28

28

00:01:08.210  -->  00:01:10.980
And let's start with the inline script, okay?
29

29

00:01:10.980  -->  00:01:13.323
So all we have to do is to write script,
30

30

00:01:18.510  -->  00:01:19.560
give it some space
31

31

00:01:19.560  -->  00:01:20.393
and then in here
32

32

00:01:20.393  -->  00:01:23.310
we can write our very first line of JavaScript.
33

33

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:24.300
And what we're gonna do now
34

34

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:25.440
is to simply print
35

35

00:01:25.440  -->  00:01:28.770
to the JavaScript developer console some text, okay?
36

36

00:01:28.770  -->  00:01:33.450
And so all we have to do is to write console.log()
37

37

00:01:33.450  -->  00:01:34.593
and then some text.
38

38

00:01:36.270  -->  00:01:38.530
And we will write hello world.
39

39

00:01:38.530  -->  00:01:40.210
And this is kind of a standard text
40

40

00:01:40.210  -->  00:01:41.070
that we print out
41

41

00:01:41.070  -->  00:01:43.110
whenever we are learning a new language
42

42

00:01:43.110  -->  00:01:46.070
or like starting a new app or something like that, okay?
43

43

00:01:46.070  -->  00:01:48.450
So, hello world, you will see this here all the time
44

44

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:52.640
when you search for tutorials on the web or something, okay?
45

45

00:01:52.640  -->  00:01:54.130
And then to finish the line
46

46

00:01:54.130  -->  00:01:57.370
we always have to add a semicolon like this.
47

47

00:01:57.370  -->  00:02:00.940
And today this our very first line of JavaScript code here.
48

48

00:02:00.940  -->  00:02:02.130
So nothing really fancy.
49

49

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:04.655
All it does is to log to the developer console
50

50

00:02:04.655  -->  00:02:07.540
this hello world text, okay?
51

51

00:02:07.540  -->  00:02:10.990
Then we give it a save and open it up in the browser.
52

52

00:02:10.990  -->  00:02:12.700
I have installed a Brackets plug-in
53

53

00:02:12.700  -->  00:02:14.210
to automatically save the file
54

54

00:02:14.210  -->  00:02:16.260
whenever I leave the app
55

55

00:02:16.260  -->  00:02:17.930
and that's called Autosave.
56

56

00:02:17.930  -->  00:02:21.750
And so I don't always have to save the file manually, okay?
57

57

00:02:21.750  -->  00:02:23.480
So I'm gonna leave now here
58

58

00:02:23.480  -->  00:02:26.640
and then open up this folder, double-click the file
59

59

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:30.150
and then it's going to open it right in the browser.
60

60

00:02:30.150  -->  00:02:32.520
So on the left side in our code editor
61

61

00:02:32.520  -->  00:02:34.177
we write our code, of course,
62

62

00:02:34.177  -->  00:02:36.330
and then in the browser on the right side
63

63

00:02:36.330  -->  00:02:38.040
we will have our results.
64

64

00:02:38.040  -->  00:02:39.520
And to actually see these results
65

65

00:02:39.520  -->  00:02:42.310
we have to open up our JavaScript developer console.
66

66

00:02:42.310  -->  00:02:45.020
And you can do that by hitting Command + Option + J,
67

67

00:02:45.020  -->  00:02:47.500
or Control + Option + J on your keyboard.
68

68

00:02:47.500  -->  00:02:49.330
It's a shortcut like this,
69

69

00:02:49.330  -->  00:02:52.400
or you can also right-click, hit Inspect,
70

70

00:02:52.400  -->  00:02:54.540
and then come to the console like this.
71

71

00:02:54.540  -->  00:02:55.990
And here you see that we already have
72

72

00:02:55.990  -->  00:02:58.910
our hello world printed to the developer console.
73

73

00:02:58.910  -->  00:02:59.990
And you see on this side
74

74

00:02:59.990  -->  00:03:03.160
the edit come from index.html on line 13.
75

75

00:03:03.160  -->  00:03:05.890
So exactly this line that we have here.
76

76

00:03:05.890  -->  00:03:07.180
So great, it works.
77

77

00:03:07.180  -->  00:03:08.870
So again, nothing really fancy here.
78

78

00:03:08.870  -->  00:03:11.600
All we do is to log some text to the console.
79

79

00:03:11.600  -->  00:03:13.430
And that's what we're going to do here
80

80

00:03:13.430  -->  00:03:14.263
throughout the sections.
81

81

00:03:14.263  -->  00:03:16.980
So we're gonna log some texts all the time to the console
82

82

00:03:16.980  -->  00:03:18.930
because we're not really doing anything
83

83

00:03:18.930  -->  00:03:22.660
here in the browser itself so no real website.
84

84

00:03:22.660  -->  00:03:23.510
Because that's something
85

85

00:03:23.510  -->  00:03:25.040
that we're gonna take care of later.
86

86

00:03:25.040  -->  00:03:28.100
For now, we are just really learning the JavaScript language
87

87

00:03:28.100  -->  00:03:31.210
and so logging some values here to the developer console
88

88

00:03:31.210  -->  00:03:33.810
is perfect for that kind of application.
89

89

00:03:33.810  -->  00:03:36.450
Okay, so this is how we do inline scripts here.
90

90

00:03:36.450  -->  00:03:41.020
Now let's learn how to add an external script to our site.
91

91

00:03:41.020  -->  00:03:41.853
Okay?
92

92

00:03:41.853  -->  00:03:44.173
So, first off, of course, we create a new file.
93

93

00:03:45.410  -->  00:03:49.320
And I'm calling it script.js, okay?
94

94

00:03:49.320  -->  00:03:51.980
And now let's actually add the same code here.
95

95

00:03:51.980  -->  00:03:56.980
So console.log() and then hello world again.
96

96

00:03:58.490  -->  00:04:01.570
And now I'm using three of these exclamation marks here
97

97

00:04:01.570  -->  00:04:04.720
just so that it's a different kind of text here
98

98

00:04:04.720  -->  00:04:06.700
than before, okay?
99

99

00:04:06.700  -->  00:04:09.870
Than back in our index.html file
100

100

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:12.123
we can now, of course, delete this code here.
101

101

00:04:13.900  -->  00:04:16.980
We leave the script because we still need it.
102

102

00:04:16.980  -->  00:04:20.600
But now what we do is to define the source attribute.
103

103

00:04:20.600  -->  00:04:24.400
So we write source, and then script.js, okay?
104

104

00:04:24.400  -->  00:04:26.020
And so now, our script file
105

105

00:04:26.020  -->  00:04:29.140
and our html file are linked through this.
106

106

00:04:29.140  -->  00:04:31.570
Now, if the script was like in another folder,
107

107

00:04:31.570  -->  00:04:34.150
like for example called, JavaScript or js,
108

108

00:04:34.150  -->  00:04:38.110
then we would have to write like js/script.js,
109

109

00:04:38.110  -->  00:04:39.150
but that is not the case here
110

110

00:04:39.150  -->  00:04:41.230
and so let's get rid of that.
111

111

00:04:41.230  -->  00:04:43.280
And so that's already all we have to do
112

112

00:04:43.280  -->  00:04:46.570
to add an external script to our website like this.
113

113

00:04:46.570  -->  00:04:48.484
So let's come back here reload.
114

114

00:04:48.484  -->  00:04:50.590
And now we have hello world again
115

115

00:04:50.590  -->  00:04:52.591
but with our three exclamation points
116

116

00:04:52.591  -->  00:04:54.410
and then you also see that it comes from
117

117

00:04:54.410  -->  00:04:56.763
script.js on line one now.
118

118

00:04:57.730  -->  00:05:02.290
And so that's exactly this text that we have here, okay?
119

119

00:05:02.290  -->  00:05:05.340
And from now on we will use this script.js file here
120

120

00:05:05.340  -->  00:05:07.480
because it's always best to have the code
121

121

00:05:07.480  -->  00:05:09.010
in an external file.
122

122

00:05:09.010  -->  00:05:11.950
So the advantage of the inline script that we had before
123

123

00:05:11.950  -->  00:05:14.370
is that we don't have to load an additional file,
124

124

00:05:14.370  -->  00:05:17.010
but it's still better to have everything in an external file
125

125

00:05:17.010  -->  00:05:18.910
because it allows us to nicely keep
126

126

00:05:18.910  -->  00:05:22.350
the HTML at the JavaScript separated in different files.
127

127

00:05:22.350  -->  00:05:23.183
Okay?
128

128

00:05:23.183  -->  00:05:24.016
And so that's what we're going to do
129

129

00:05:24.016  -->  00:05:26.090
throughout the rest of the course.
130

130

00:05:26.090  -->  00:05:28.590
Okay, and that's already it for this lecture.
131

131

00:05:28.590  -->  00:05:29.820
So you learned the difference between
132

132

00:05:29.820  -->  00:05:31.810
inline and external scripts.
133

133

00:05:31.810  -->  00:05:34.640
And you wrote your very first line of JavaScript
134

134

00:05:34.640  -->  00:05:37.660
where we logged this text here to the console.
135

135

00:05:37.660  -->  00:05:38.760
And with that being said
136

136

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:40.621
let's now move on together to the next lecture
137

137

00:05:40.621  -->  00:05:43.650
where you will learn what JavaScript actually is.
138

138

00:05:43.650  -->  00:05:45.343
So, see you there in a second.
