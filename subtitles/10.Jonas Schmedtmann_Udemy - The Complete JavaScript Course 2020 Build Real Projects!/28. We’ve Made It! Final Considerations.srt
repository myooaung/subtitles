<v Jonas>First of all, a huge congratulations.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,613  -->  00:00:07,174
You have made it all the way through this app
3

3

00:00:07,174  -->  00:00:11,142
without giving up and that's really, really amazing.
4

4

00:00:11,142  -->  00:00:13,369
I'm really happy for you right now
5

5

00:00:13,369  -->  00:00:16,198
and I really hope that you enjoyed this project
6

6

00:00:16,198  -->  00:00:19,800
as much as I enjoyed coding it with you.
7

7

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:24,712
So, let's now look at the final structure of our app.
8

8

00:00:24,712  -->  00:00:28,019
So, this is what we built throughout all these lectures
9

9

00:00:28,019  -->  00:00:30,020
all these methods and functions
10

10

00:00:30,020  -->  00:00:34,040
sitting in different modules and calling one another.
11

11

00:00:34,040  -->  00:00:37,413
So, please take some time now to look at the entire code
12

12

00:00:37,413  -->  00:00:40,817
that we wrote and then compare it with this diagram
13

13

00:00:40,817  -->  00:00:44,201
to see that this is really exactly what we did
14

14

00:00:44,201  -->  00:00:47,194
because, you know, just looking at the code
15

15

00:00:47,194  -->  00:00:49,334
can be really confusing, right?
16

16

00:00:49,334  -->  00:00:51,659
But after having something like this,
17

17

00:00:51,659  -->  00:00:54,046
it all starts to make sense.
18

18

00:00:54,046  -->  00:00:56,809
So yeah, you should do that.
19

19

00:00:56,809  -->  00:01:00,195
And then, after that is done, I want you to think
20

20

00:01:00,195  -->  00:01:02,784
of ways in which you could extend this app
21

21

00:01:02,784  -->  00:01:05,524
and add even more features to it,
22

22

00:01:05,524  -->  00:01:08,212
and then, of course, I want you to implement
23

23

00:01:08,212  -->  00:01:10,098
these features as well.
24

24

00:01:10,098  -->  00:01:13,914
So, not just thinking about them but really coding them,
25

25

00:01:13,914  -->  00:01:16,082
and that will be a great way build up
26

26

00:01:16,082  -->  00:01:17,807
your knowledge even more
27

27

00:01:17,807  -->  00:01:20,389
and to start getting some practice in a project
28

28

00:01:20,389  -->  00:01:22,396
that you're already familiar with.
29

29

00:01:22,396  -->  00:01:24,618
So, that makes it a lot easier.
30

30

00:01:24,618  -->  00:01:27,501
So, good luck with that and make sure
31

31

00:01:27,501  -->  00:01:30,001
to share your progress with the community.
32

32

00:01:30,001  -->  00:01:34,168
I can't wait to see the features that you come up with.
