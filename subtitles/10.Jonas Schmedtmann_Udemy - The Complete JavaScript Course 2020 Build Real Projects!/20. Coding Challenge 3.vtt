<v Instructor>Welcome to the next coding challenge.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.580  -->  00:00:07.410
In this one you're gonna build a very simple tip calculator.
3

3

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:09.920
So John and his family went on a holiday
4

4

00:00:09.920  -->  00:00:12.130
and went to three different restaurants,
5

5

00:00:12.130  -->  00:00:17.130
and the bills were 124, 48, and 268 dollars.
6

6

00:00:17.480  -->  00:00:20.090
Now to tip the waiter a fair amount,
7

7

00:00:20.090  -->  00:00:23.660
John created a simple tip calculator as a function.
8

8

00:00:23.660  -->  00:00:25.900
And the way that John calculates his tips,
9

9

00:00:25.900  -->  00:00:28.900
is that he likes to tip 20 percent of the bill
10

10

00:00:28.900  -->  00:00:31.010
when then bill is less than 50 dollars,
11

11

00:00:31.010  -->  00:00:34.870
15 percent when the bill is between 50 and 200 dollars,
12

12

00:00:34.870  -->  00:00:39.290
and 10 percent of the bill if it is more than 200 dollars,
13

13

00:00:39.290  -->  00:00:40.900
and this may not make a lot of sense,
14

14

00:00:40.900  -->  00:00:43.610
but this is just for this small exercise
15

15

00:00:43.610  -->  00:00:46.830
so we have some more stuff to do in our function, okay.
16

16

00:00:46.830  -->  00:00:49.910
So in the end, John would like to have two arrays
17

17

00:00:49.910  -->  00:00:51.450
as the end results.
18

18

00:00:51.450  -->  00:00:55.200
So one containing all three tips, so one for each bill,
19

19

00:00:55.200  -->  00:00:58.690
and then one containing all three final paid amounts,
20

20

00:00:58.690  -->  00:01:02.640
and with paid amounts, I mean the bill plus the paid tip.
21

21

00:01:02.640  -->  00:01:05.700
Okay, so we want a function that calculates the tip,
22

22

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:07.420
and then we want two arrays,
23

23

00:01:07.420  -->  00:01:10.790
one with just the tips and one with tips plus the bill.
24

24

00:01:10.790  -->  00:01:13.730
Okay, and if you're not sure how to calculate a percentage,
25

25

00:01:13.730  -->  00:01:16.450
for example if you want to take 20 percent of a value,
26

26

00:01:16.450  -->  00:01:19.440
you have to simply multiply that value by 0.2,
27

27

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:24.160
which is 20 divided by 100, okay, so that's very simple.
28

28

00:01:24.160  -->  00:01:26.440
Alright, so I hope you manage to do this,
29

29

00:01:26.440  -->  00:01:28.100
this will be a good challenge for you
30

30

00:01:28.100  -->  00:01:30.660
to use most of the stuff that we talked about
31

31

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:32.070
up until this point.
32

32

00:01:32.070  -->  00:01:34.190
So give it some time, try it out,
33

33

00:01:34.190  -->  00:01:37.210
and then I'll see you in the next video with the solution.
34

34

00:01:37.210  -->  00:01:38.043
Good luck.
