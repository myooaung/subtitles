<v ->Welcome back to the next real-world project.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,700  -->  00:00:06,410
So, now its time to use everything
3

3

00:00:06,410  -->  00:00:08,200
that you learned about ES6,
4

4

00:00:08,200  -->  00:00:09,900
and asynchronous JavaScript,
5

5

00:00:09,900  -->  00:00:13,250
in order to build yet another beautiful real project.
6

6

00:00:13,250  -->  00:00:15,990
This time, interacting with a real API
7

7

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:19,480
to fetch and display some real food recipe data.
8

8

00:00:19,480  -->  00:00:21,800
And along the way you're also going to be using
9

9

00:00:21,800  -->  00:00:23,480
some modern JavaScript tools
10

10

00:00:23,480  -->  00:00:26,430
that every modern developer uses these days.
11

11

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:29,670
Things like webpack, to bundle together JavaScript modules,
12

12

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:34,010
and babel, to convert ES6 code back to ES5.
13

13

00:00:34,010  -->  00:00:35,970
So besides applying all these cool
14

14

00:00:35,970  -->  00:00:39,522
ES6, ES7, and ES8 features to a real context,
15

15

00:00:39,522  -->  00:00:42,640
we're also going to be building a modern workflow,
16

16

00:00:42,640  -->  00:00:45,640
that you can use in all your future projects.
17

17

00:00:45,640  -->  00:00:47,610
So this is really exciting stuff,
18

18

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:50,920
and this is by far my favorite project in the course.
19

19

00:00:50,920  -->  00:00:53,390
So I can't wait to show it to you now.
