00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:02.260
<v Instructor>Hey there.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.260  -->  00:00:04.650
Let's now set up our development workflow
3

3

00:00:04.650  -->  00:00:07.970
which will include npm scripts, webpack and Babel
4

4

00:00:07.970  -->  00:00:11.083
by installing Node.js and npm on our computer.
5

5

00:00:11.960  -->  00:00:13.680
So in order to install Node.js,
6

6

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:16.370
just head over to nodejs.org
7

7

00:00:16.370  -->  00:00:18.940
and then down here you just have the buttons
8

8

00:00:18.940  -->  00:00:20.760
for downloading Node.js.
9

9

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:23.130
And make sure to install the first one
10

10

00:00:23.130  -->  00:00:25.280
which has recommend for most users.
11

11

00:00:25.280  -->  00:00:26.720
And maybe you're on another version,
12

12

00:00:26.720  -->  00:00:29.970
maybe it's not 8.10, which is the most current version
13

13

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:31.730
by the time of recording this video,
14

14

00:00:31.730  -->  00:00:35.140
but anything above 8.10 should be fine.
15

15

00:00:35.140  -->  00:00:37.420
So, I'm not going to download and install it right now
16

16

00:00:37.420  -->  00:00:40.020
because of course I already have it installed,
17

17

00:00:40.020  -->  00:00:42.800
but please go ahead and, and do that now.
18

18

00:00:42.800  -->  00:00:45.760
Then after everything installs correctly and you're ready,
19

19

00:00:45.760  -->  00:00:48.510
open up your terminal so that we can confirm
20

20

00:00:48.510  -->  00:00:51.010
if Node.js actually installed correctly.
21

21

00:00:51.010  -->  00:00:52.987
And in order to that, simply write,
22

22

00:00:52.987  -->  00:00:55.580
"node" and then "-v",
23

23

00:00:55.580  -->  00:00:58.140
and this will check the version that you have installed
24

24

00:00:58.140  -->  00:00:58.973
of Node.
25

25

00:00:58.973  -->  00:01:02.180
And so in this case, I'm on 8.9.4.
26

26

00:01:02.180  -->  00:01:03.550
And if you see the version number of Node
27

27

00:01:03.550  -->  00:01:05.370
that you just installed,
28

28

00:01:05.370  -->  00:01:07.390
then it means that you were successful.
29

29

00:01:07.390  -->  00:01:08.700
So everything's working fine.
30

30

00:01:08.700  -->  00:01:10.050
Now if you get an error here,
31

31

00:01:10.050  -->  00:01:12.920
then it means that Node is not correctly installed
32

32

00:01:12.920  -->  00:01:15.370
and you should probably go back and try it again,
33

33

00:01:15.370  -->  00:01:16.520
or something.
34

34

00:01:16.520  -->  00:01:19.860
Also we can check out if npm was also installed
35

35

00:01:19.860  -->  00:01:22.190
because npm, the node package manager,
36

36

00:01:22.190  -->  00:01:23.760
automatically comes with Node.
37

37

00:01:23.760  -->  00:01:27.250
And so we're typing "npm" also "-v",
38

38

00:01:27.250  -->  00:01:29.720
so flag for, for version.
39

39

00:01:29.720  -->  00:01:31.470
Then you should also get your version number
40

40

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:33.790
which in this case is 5.6.0,
41

41

00:01:33.790  -->  00:01:35.570
but if you get anything above that,
42

42

00:01:35.570  -->  00:01:37.470
it should work just fine.
43

43

00:01:37.470  -->  00:01:39.660
Okay, and with Node now installed,
44

44

00:01:39.660  -->  00:01:42.820
let's go ahead and create a package.json file
45

45

00:01:42.820  -->  00:01:44.030
for our project.
46

46

00:01:44.030  -->  00:01:46.710
And I'm gonna explain a bit later what exactly that is.
47

47

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:49.101
For now, let's just move into our project folder
48

48

00:01:49.101  -->  00:01:51.918
and create that package.json file in there.
49

49

00:01:51.918  -->  00:01:53.510
So here in the terminal, remember,
50

50

00:01:53.510  -->  00:01:55.913
we use "cd" to move to the folders.
51

51

00:01:57.920  -->  00:02:01.063
And I'm on "Desktop" and then I'm on "9-forkify"
52

52

00:02:03.250  -->  00:02:04.470
Let's check it out.
53

53

00:02:04.470  -->  00:02:07.120
And here we are with the dist and source folders
54

54

00:02:07.120  -->  00:02:09.380
just as we saw in the last lecture.
55

55

00:02:09.380  -->  00:02:11.460
Now to create our package.json file,
56

56

00:02:11.460  -->  00:02:13.090
which is basically a file which contains
57

57

00:02:13.090  -->  00:02:15.940
informations about a project for npm,
58

58

00:02:15.940  -->  00:02:17.700
we just type "npm init"
59

59

00:02:18.760  -->  00:02:22.000
and then it will start asking us some questions down here.
60

60

00:02:22.000  -->  00:02:23.730
So we can say the package name,
61

61

00:02:23.730  -->  00:02:25.437
now we'll just call it "forkify".
62

62

00:02:26.960  -->  00:02:29.700
You see that here in parentheses, that's the default name
63

63

00:02:29.700  -->  00:02:32.927
that is automatically taken if we don't write anything here.
64

64

00:02:32.927  -->  00:02:35.540
And the version in 1.0.0 is okay.
65

65

00:02:35.540  -->  00:02:37.720
The description I can say
66

66

00:02:41.670  -->  00:02:43.570
something like "forkify project".
67

67

00:02:43.570  -->  00:02:45.680
The entry point doesn't really matter at this point.
68

68

00:02:45.680  -->  00:02:48.743
Test command, git, keywords, author,
69

69

00:02:51.420  -->  00:02:52.560
you can put your own name here,
70

70

00:02:52.560  -->  00:02:53.820
license.
71

71

00:02:53.820  -->  00:02:56.180
And now, we have the final result here,
72

72

00:02:56.180  -->  00:02:57.880
and we just hit the return again.
73

73

00:02:57.880  -->  00:03:00.400
And so this will be our package.json file.
74

74

00:03:00.400  -->  00:03:02.440
And if we hit "ls" again now,
75

75

00:03:02.440  -->  00:03:05.520
we see that we already have this file in here now.
76

76

00:03:05.520  -->  00:03:08.203
So let's now head over to our text editor.
77

77

00:03:09.240  -->  00:03:11.310
And indeed, you see that it is already here.
78

78

00:03:11.310  -->  00:03:12.800
So package.json.
79

79

00:03:12.800  -->  00:03:16.090
So you see the name that we gave it, the description,
80

80

00:03:16.090  -->  00:03:17.320
and the author.
81

81

00:03:17.320  -->  00:03:19.150
Then we also have something called "scripts"
82

82

00:03:19.150  -->  00:03:21.890
and we're gonna talk about that a bit later.
83

83

00:03:21.890  -->  00:03:24.000
And again, I'm gonna explain a bit better
84

84

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:26.290
what this package.json file's all about,
85

85

00:03:26.290  -->  00:03:30.830
but for now let's go ahead and install webpack using npm.
86

86

00:03:30.830  -->  00:03:33.570
So I'm going back here to my npm.
87

87

00:03:33.570  -->  00:03:35.660
And so in order to install packages,
88

88

00:03:35.660  -->  00:03:40.660
rewrite "npm install webpack"
89

89

00:03:41.200  -->  00:03:44.077
and then we also have to say "--save-dev".
90

90

00:03:45.990  -->  00:03:47.520
"--save-dev".
91

91

00:03:47.520  -->  00:03:49.800
And what this "--save-dev" option here means
92

92

00:03:49.800  -->  00:03:51.570
is that it will save webpack as a
93

93

00:03:51.570  -->  00:03:53.963
development pendency of our project.
94

94

00:03:54.900  -->  00:03:58.350
So you will see this in our package.json file in a second
95

95

00:03:58.350  -->  00:04:01.233
after the webpack has installed.
96

96

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:03.610
And so that's it.
97

97

00:04:03.610  -->  00:04:06.020
Let's now go back to our package.json file,
98

98

00:04:06.020  -->  00:04:07.550
and indeed, here it is.
99

99

00:04:07.550  -->  00:04:10.870
So we saved webpack as a dev dependency,
100

100

00:04:10.870  -->  00:04:13.490
by using the "--save-dev" option, right?
101

101

00:04:13.490  -->  00:04:16.690
And so, now in our package.json it created this
102

102

00:04:16.690  -->  00:04:20.680
dev dependencies field to which it added the webpack package
103

103

00:04:20.680  -->  00:04:23.820
on the current version 4.2.0.
104

104

00:04:23.820  -->  00:04:24.860
Okay?
105

105

00:04:24.860  -->  00:04:27.870
So, remember, in the inter lecture about modern Javascript
106

106

00:04:27.870  -->  00:04:29.620
that I mentioned that we basically have
107

107

00:04:29.620  -->  00:04:32.360
two types of Node.js packages.
108

108

00:04:32.360  -->  00:04:35.220
Ones are libraries and frameworks and stuff like that,
109

109

00:04:35.220  -->  00:04:37.520
and others are development tools.
110

110

00:04:37.520  -->  00:04:40.470
So libraries like React or jQuery, for example,
111

111

00:04:40.470  -->  00:04:42.130
they are really dependencies
112

112

00:04:42.130  -->  00:04:44.460
because we use this code in our,
113

113

00:04:44.460  -->  00:04:45.800
in our product, in our app.
114

114

00:04:45.800  -->  00:04:47.000
But something like webpack,
115

115

00:04:47.000  -->  00:04:49.070
this is really just a development tool.
116

116

00:04:49.070  -->  00:04:52.220
And so, it's here in the dev dependencies field.
117

117

00:04:52.220  -->  00:04:55.360
Now imagine that we wanted to use something like jQuery here
118

118

00:04:55.360  -->  00:04:57.980
then we can also go ahead and install it.
119

119

00:04:57.980  -->  00:05:02.860
So let's say "npm install jquery"
120

120

00:05:02.860  -->  00:05:05.240
but this time we only say "--save".
121

121

00:05:05.240  -->  00:05:06.073
Okay?
122

122

00:05:06.073  -->  00:05:08.410
And so this will not save it as a dev dependency,
123

123

00:05:08.410  -->  00:05:10.230
but as a dependency.
124

124

00:05:10.230  -->  00:05:12.770
So let's go ahead and check that one out.
125

125

00:05:12.770  -->  00:05:14.230
And indeed, here it is.
126

126

00:05:14.230  -->  00:05:16.810
So dev dependencies is webpack right now
127

127

00:05:16.810  -->  00:05:19.635
and dependencies is jQuery, okay.
128

128

00:05:19.635  -->  00:05:21.340
And so this file here now,
129

129

00:05:21.340  -->  00:05:24.380
has all of these informations listing all of the packages,
130

130

00:05:24.380  -->  00:05:27.550
so all of the dependencies that we use in our project.
131

131

00:05:27.550  -->  00:05:28.570
And that's very important
132

132

00:05:28.570  -->  00:05:31.684
because if you were to move this project to another computer
133

133

00:05:31.684  -->  00:05:34.440
or work with another person on the same project,
134

134

00:05:34.440  -->  00:05:35.780
then everyone's on the same page.
135

135

00:05:35.780  -->  00:05:39.920
So everyone knows which dependency we're using in our app.
136

136

00:05:39.920  -->  00:05:42.360
It's also important because it allows us to install
137

137

00:05:42.360  -->  00:05:44.452
all of these dependencies here automatically
138

138

00:05:44.452  -->  00:05:48.590
if you don't have the, this node module folder, okay?
139

139

00:05:48.590  -->  00:05:51.380
So this folder here is where all the packages go.
140

140

00:05:51.380  -->  00:05:52.217
So let's take a look at it.
141

141

00:05:52.217  -->  00:05:54.760
And you see that these are all the packages right now
142

142

00:05:54.760  -->  00:05:57.480
in our node modules folder.
143

143

00:05:57.480  -->  00:05:59.640
And they are here because these are actually
144

144

00:05:59.640  -->  00:06:02.040
the dependencies of these dependencies.
145

145

00:06:02.040  -->  00:06:03.720
So for example, webpack or jQuery,
146

146

00:06:03.720  -->  00:06:06.680
they themselves have lots of dependencies.
147

147

00:06:06.680  -->  00:06:09.507
And so we need to install all of these here automatically
148

148

00:06:09.507  -->  00:06:13.100
in order for webpack and jQuery to work.
149

149

00:06:13.100  -->  00:06:13.933
Okay?
150

150

00:06:13.933  -->  00:06:16.100
Now, if we went to share our entire project here
151

151

00:06:16.100  -->  00:06:17.000
with someone else,
152

152

00:06:17.000  -->  00:06:20.500
we wouldn't have to share this, this huge folder here
153

153

00:06:20.500  -->  00:06:23.150
which has these thousands and thousands of files.
154

154

00:06:23.150  -->  00:06:24.580
We really wouldn't need to share.
155

155

00:06:24.580  -->  00:06:27.410
All we need to share is this package.json file
156

156

00:06:27.410  -->  00:06:30.280
which has this information about our dependencies.
157

157

00:06:30.280  -->  00:06:32.090
And the other person could then go ahead
158

158

00:06:32.090  -->  00:06:34.870
and automatically install these dependencies.
159

159

00:06:34.870  -->  00:06:37.210
And let me actually show how we could do that.
160

160

00:06:37.210  -->  00:06:40.423
So let's actually go ahead and remove this folder.
161

161

00:06:41.288  -->  00:06:42.121
Okay.
162

162

00:06:42.121  -->  00:06:44.740
And so now all our dependencies are actually gone.
163

163

00:06:44.740  -->  00:06:46.540
So we have no more dependencies.
164

164

00:06:46.540  -->  00:06:49.593
But we have our package.json file which lists
165

165

00:06:49.593  -->  00:06:51.040
the dependencies that we have.
166

166

00:06:51.040  -->  00:06:52.520
So webpack and jQuery.
167

167

00:06:52.520  -->  00:06:56.420
So if now go ahead and simply type "npm install",
168

168

00:06:56.420  -->  00:06:57.670
then it will go ahead,
169

169

00:06:57.670  -->  00:07:00.764
grab our dependencies from the package.json file,
170

170

00:07:00.764  -->  00:07:02.980
and install all of them.
171

171

00:07:02.980  -->  00:07:05.130
So let's go back and here it is again.
172

172

00:07:05.130  -->  00:07:07.390
So here is the folder again,
173

173

00:07:07.390  -->  00:07:09.690
with all the packages back in there.
174

174

00:07:09.690  -->  00:07:12.930
Now one last thing is that we can also uninstall packages.
175

175

00:07:12.930  -->  00:07:15.030
So right now, we don't really need jQuery here.
176

176

00:07:15.030  -->  00:07:17.100
So let's go ahead and delete it.
177

177

00:07:17.100  -->  00:07:18.490
So to uninstall it.
178

178

00:07:18.490  -->  00:07:21.817
And all we have to do is to say "npm uninstall jquery"
179

179

00:07:24.437  -->  00:07:26.077
and again "--save".
180

180

00:07:26.960  -->  00:07:28.950
And so let's wait for it.
181

181

00:07:28.950  -->  00:07:31.410
And if we go back, now you see that this,
182

182

00:07:31.410  -->  00:07:32.660
this object here is empty.
183

183

00:07:32.660  -->  00:07:34.450
So no more dependencies.
184

184

00:07:34.450  -->  00:07:37.340
We have only this webpack dependency right now.
185

185

00:07:37.340  -->  00:07:38.173
Okay?
186

186

00:07:38.173  -->  00:07:40.210
So that's installing and uninstalling.
187

187

00:07:40.210  -->  00:07:41.130
Now before we leave,
188

188

00:07:41.130  -->  00:07:44.530
actually there's still one more thing that I want to mention
189

189

00:07:44.530  -->  00:07:47.112
which is that these packages that we installed here
190

190

00:07:47.112  -->  00:07:50.250
with the "--save-dev" and "--save" options,
191

191

00:07:50.250  -->  00:07:51.430
they are locally installed.
192

192

00:07:51.430  -->  00:07:54.130
So they are installed only for this project.
193

193

00:07:54.130  -->  00:07:56.525
But we can also install packages globally.
194

194

00:07:56.525  -->  00:07:57.360
Okay?
195

195

00:07:57.360  -->  00:07:59.190
So basically in order to make them
196

196

00:07:59.190  -->  00:08:01.700
accessible from everywhere on our computer.
197

197

00:08:01.700  -->  00:08:03.130
Right now, this webpack dependency
198

198

00:08:03.130  -->  00:08:05.220
only works inside of this project.
199

199

00:08:05.220  -->  00:08:06.940
But if you wanted to install it globally
200

200

00:08:06.940  -->  00:08:08.800
and make it accessible from everywhere,
201

201

00:08:08.800  -->  00:08:10.520
we could also do that.
202

202

00:08:10.520  -->  00:08:12.260
Let me show you how, and actually,
203

203

00:08:12.260  -->  00:08:13.907
we're going to do that with another package.
204

204

00:08:13.907  -->  00:08:16.590
Not webpack, but instead, let's use
205

205

00:08:16.590  -->  00:08:18.120
something called "Live Server"
206

206

00:08:18.120  -->  00:08:20.670
which is another package that I, that I really like
207

207

00:08:20.670  -->  00:08:23.863
which allows us to create a very simple and local webserver
208

208

00:08:23.863  -->  00:08:26.730
to, to serve some static websites.
209

209

00:08:26.730  -->  00:08:30.123
So again "npm install" name of the package,
210

210

00:08:31.010  -->  00:08:33.210
and then, instead of "--save" or "--save-dev",
211

211

00:08:33.210  -->  00:08:34.957
we can simply say "--global".
212

212

00:08:37.030  -->  00:08:39.553
And now let me show it to you.
213

213

00:08:41.300  -->  00:08:43.960
And yeah, so we got this error here
214

214

00:08:43.960  -->  00:08:45.820
which is basically because we don't have
215

215

00:08:45.820  -->  00:08:47.160
permissions to do this.
216

216

00:08:47.160  -->  00:08:50.330
So on Mac and Linux, you have to prefix this command here
217

217

00:08:50.330  -->  00:08:54.180
with "sudo" in order to give permission to do this.
218

218

00:08:54.180  -->  00:08:55.760
On Windows, maybe it is not necessary,
219

219

00:08:55.760  -->  00:08:56.910
but usually on a Mac,
220

220

00:08:56.910  -->  00:08:59.100
this is what happens when you install global packages.
221

221

00:08:59.100  -->  00:09:00.000
So let's try it again.
222

222

00:09:00.000  -->  00:09:02.270
I will put in my password,
223

223

00:09:02.270  -->  00:09:04.173
and now it should install globally.
224

224

00:09:05.570  -->  00:09:06.403
Okay.
225

225

00:09:06.403  -->  00:09:08.580
And so remember that this was installed globally,
226

226

00:09:08.580  -->  00:09:10.480
and so I should be able to run this command now
227

227

00:09:10.480  -->  00:09:11.480
from everywhere.
228

228

00:09:11.480  -->  00:09:13.683
So let's move out of this folder, actually.
229

229

00:09:15.370  -->  00:09:16.760
And so now, I'm back on the desktop.
230

230

00:09:16.760  -->  00:09:18.380
So on a completely different folder.
231

231

00:09:18.380  -->  00:09:21.951
And I can now run disc command, just like any other command,
232

232

00:09:21.951  -->  00:09:23.540
here in the command line.
233

233

00:09:23.540  -->  00:09:24.647
So "live-server",
234

234

00:09:25.610  -->  00:09:27.580
and now, this is not going to work actually,
235

235

00:09:27.580  -->  00:09:29.500
but let me show what happens.
236

236

00:09:29.500  -->  00:09:30.390
And actually it did work.
237

237

00:09:30.390  -->  00:09:34.560
So it opened here a local webserver here on this port
238

238

00:09:34.560  -->  00:09:38.730
showing me the folders that are in the current directory.
239

239

00:09:38.730  -->  00:09:39.563
Okay?
240

240

00:09:39.563  -->  00:09:43.347
So let's go back to the terminal and here see,
241

241

00:09:43.347  -->  00:09:46.250
"Serving users" and then here the URL.
242

242

00:09:46.250  -->  00:09:50.583
Now to exit this program here, let's hit Control C.
243

243

00:09:52.050  -->  00:09:54.640
And so in order to move out of this program.
244

244

00:09:54.640  -->  00:09:55.473
Okay?
245

245

00:09:55.473  -->  00:09:57.010
So this was just to show you that
246

246

00:09:57.010  -->  00:09:59.710
there are locally installed packages with "--save"
247

247

00:09:59.710  -->  00:10:00.850
and "--save-dev"
248

248

00:10:00.850  -->  00:10:03.730
and then we can also use globally installed packages,
249

249

00:10:03.730  -->  00:10:06.750
like we did here with this Live Server example.
250

250

00:10:06.750  -->  00:10:07.650
Okay?
251

251

00:10:07.650  -->  00:10:11.020
Now let's move back into our project folder,
252

252

00:10:11.020  -->  00:10:12.648
clear this console,
253

253

00:10:12.648  -->  00:10:15.320
and yeah, I think that's all that I had to show you
254

254

00:10:15.320  -->  00:10:16.560
in this video.
255

255

00:10:16.560  -->  00:10:18.620
So we installed Node.js,
256

256

00:10:18.620  -->  00:10:20.450
then we used npm package manager
257

257

00:10:20.450  -->  00:10:22.750
in order to install dependencies.
258

258

00:10:22.750  -->  00:10:25.120
And remember they are dev dependencies
259

259

00:10:25.120  -->  00:10:27.770
which are only tools that we use for development.
260

260

00:10:27.770  -->  00:10:30.150
And then there are like real dependencies,
261

261

00:10:30.150  -->  00:10:33.140
so code that is actually used in our app.
262

262

00:10:33.140  -->  00:10:35.440
So imagine we're building a React app,
263

263

00:10:35.440  -->  00:10:38.070
then of course we need to use the React API,
264

264

00:10:38.070  -->  00:10:41.210
and so that's going to be a real dependency, okay?
265

265

00:10:41.210  -->  00:10:45.040
And besides these two locally installed packages
266

266

00:10:45.040  -->  00:10:47.200
we have the global packages
267

267

00:10:47.200  -->  00:10:49.520
which we installed using the "--global" flag here
268

268

00:10:49.520  -->  00:10:51.110
in the command line which can,
269

269

00:10:51.110  -->  00:10:53.710
instead of global you can also write;
270

270

00:10:53.710  -->  00:10:56.330
so instead of writing this, you can also simply use
271

271

00:10:56.330  -->  00:10:59.363
the "-g" flag, okay, which is a lot easier.
272

272

00:11:00.690  -->  00:11:01.920
So, that's it.
273

273

00:11:01.920  -->  00:11:04.440
In the next lecture, we're then going to go ahead
274

274

00:11:04.440  -->  00:11:05.683
and configure webpack.
