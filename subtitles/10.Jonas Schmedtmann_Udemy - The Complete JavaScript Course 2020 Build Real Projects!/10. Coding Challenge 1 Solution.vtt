00:00:01.311  -->  00:00:03.285
<v Jonas>So, here goes my solution</v>
2

2

00:00:03.285  -->  00:00:04.975
to the coding challenge.
3

3

00:00:04.975  -->  00:00:07.388
We start by defining the variables;
4

4

00:00:07.388  -->  00:00:09.721
so var, mass-Mark, equals...
5

5

00:00:12.496  -->  00:00:14.394
Let's say it's, seventy-eight;
6

6

00:00:14.394  -->  00:00:16.226
and you could use any numbers that you wanted to here,
7

7

00:00:16.226  -->  00:00:19.588
so I didn't define what the masses and heights were,
8

8

00:00:19.588  -->  00:00:23.971
just remember that they have to be in kilograms.
9

9

00:00:23.971  -->  00:00:26.233
Let's give us some more space here...
10

10

00:00:26.233  -->  00:00:30.233
So, we have mass-Mark, then we have height-Mark,
11

11

00:00:33.987  -->  00:00:36.654
let's say one-sixty-nine meters;
12

12

00:00:38.125  -->  00:00:40.364
so not, not really tall.
13

13

00:00:40.364  -->  00:00:42.966
Okay, and we could declare all of these variables here
14

14

00:00:42.966  -->  00:00:45.104
in one line, but I'm not going to do that right now.
15

15

00:00:45.104  -->  00:00:49.551
I'm just going to declare them one after the other.
16

16

00:00:49.551  -->  00:00:53.218
So, Mark and now John; ninety-two kilograms,
17

17

00:00:55.837  -->  00:00:57.504
and then the height,
18

18

00:01:05.044  -->  00:01:08.236
and so that's step number one, I think.
19

19

00:01:08.236  -->  00:01:11.208
Now next step, calculate both their BMI's.
20

20

00:01:11.208  -->  00:01:13.791
And so, BMI-Mark is Mark's mass
21

21

00:01:20.626  -->  00:01:24.381
divided by the square of his height.
22

22

00:01:24.381  -->  00:01:27.631
So height-Mark times height-Mark again,
23

23

00:01:30.674  -->  00:01:34.341
and then body mass index-John, so mass-John,
24

24

00:01:38.032  -->  00:01:41.449
divided by height-John times height-John.
25

25

00:01:43.636  -->  00:01:46.831
So. That was step number two, and now we will
26

26

00:01:46.831  -->  00:01:48.909
want to create a boolean, to determine
27

27

00:01:48.909  -->  00:01:51.826
if Mark has a higher BMI than John.
28

28

00:01:53.097  -->  00:01:57.264
So, var, Mark-higher-BMI, and so all we have to do
29

29

00:02:00.365  -->  00:02:03.282
is BMI-Mark, greater than BMI-John.
30

30

00:02:07.191  -->  00:02:09.139
So, that should be our boolean variable,
31

31

00:02:09.139  -->  00:02:12.222
and now we can log it to the console.
32

32

00:02:15.419  -->  00:02:18.452
So, is-Mark's, and now we cannot just write
33

33

00:02:18.452  -->  00:02:22.517
a quotation mark, to write "Mark's" because then
34

34

00:02:22.517  -->  00:02:25.214
that would be outside of the string.
35

35

00:02:25.214  -->  00:02:27.289
So, this marks the beginning of the string,
36

36

00:02:27.289  -->  00:02:28.745
and this, the end of the string,
37

37

00:02:28.745  -->  00:02:31.067
but we still want to have the symbol here to say "Mark's,"
38

38

00:02:31.067  -->  00:02:35.226
and so what we have to do is to escape this quotation mark,
39

39

00:02:35.226  -->  00:02:38.248
and we do that by adding this back-slash.
40

40

00:02:38.248  -->  00:02:40.907
Okay? So that is called escaping.
41

41

00:02:40.907  -->  00:02:44.389
And that's something really common in programming as well.
42

42

00:02:44.389  -->  00:02:47.639
So, "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's;"
43

43

00:02:50.970  -->  00:02:55.970
and now again we need to escape, and then close that string.
44

44

00:02:56.332  -->  00:03:00.333
So, we have our string "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's;"
45

45

00:03:00.333  -->  00:03:01.952
actually, we want to ask the question,
46

46

00:03:01.952  -->  00:03:03.389
and then we say "plus,"
47

47

00:03:03.389  -->  00:03:05.220
and now you know that is an operator,
48

48

00:03:05.220  -->  00:03:08.939
and so we basically add strings together.
49

49

00:03:08.939  -->  00:03:11.297
And then Mark-higher-BMI, which,
50

50

00:03:11.297  -->  00:03:14.630
should show whether it be true or false.
51

51

00:03:15.743  -->  00:03:19.821
So, let's load it; and so, is Mark's BMI higher than John's?
52

52

00:03:19.821  -->  00:03:21.984
And it says true. And let's actually also
53

53

00:03:21.984  -->  00:03:24.187
log these two BMI's to the console,
54

54

00:03:24.187  -->  00:03:28.217
just so that we're sure if everything's working correct.
55

55

00:03:28.217  -->  00:03:31.780
So console dot log, and remember that we can actually
56

56

00:03:31.780  -->  00:03:34.322
log two values to the console at the same time,
57

57

00:03:34.322  -->  00:03:36.537
simply by adding the comma here.
58

58

00:03:36.537  -->  00:03:39.704
Okay, so, Mark and John, and so we see
59

59

00:03:41.497  -->  00:03:44.342
that the first one is twenty-seven, so Mark is twenty-seven,
60

60

00:03:44.342  -->  00:03:46.173
and John is twenty-four.
61

61

00:03:46.173  -->  00:03:48.173
And so Mark's BMI higher than John's;
62

62

00:03:48.173  -->  00:03:50.000
and of course, yeah, it's true.
63

63

00:03:50.000  -->  00:03:53.556
Because, of course, this here will return true,
64

64

00:03:53.556  -->  00:03:55.627
so it will give us the result of "true,"
65

65

00:03:55.627  -->  00:03:58.253
which will be assigned to Mark-higher-BMI.
66

66

00:03:58.253  -->  00:04:01.456
Okay. So that's the solution to the challenge.
67

67

00:04:01.456  -->  00:04:03.367
Of course, you could have done it differently,
68

68

00:04:03.367  -->  00:04:05.312
as long as the solution is the same.
69

69

00:04:05.312  -->  00:04:07.117
So in programming, many, many times,
70

70

00:04:07.117  -->  00:04:09.499
there's not just one correct solution,
71

71

00:04:09.499  -->  00:04:12.082
there are many, many ways to solve the same problem.
72

72

00:04:12.082  -->  00:04:14.240
Okay? And that's something very important
73

73

00:04:14.240  -->  00:04:16.471
that you should know, and that you should keep
74

74

00:04:16.471  -->  00:04:18.349
in mind always when you're programming.
75

75

00:04:18.349  -->  00:04:20.895
So there's not one correct way to solve a problem,
76

76

00:04:20.895  -->  00:04:22.877
there are always many, many ways,
77

77

00:04:22.877  -->  00:04:25.024
and so if you solved this in a different way,
78

78

00:04:25.024  -->  00:04:27.986
which is still correct, then it's absolutely valid,
79

79

00:04:27.986  -->  00:04:30.345
and it's great that you found a different way
80

80

00:04:30.345  -->  00:04:32.183
of solving this from my way.
81

81

00:04:32.183  -->  00:04:36.350
And so, yeah, let's now move on to the next video.
