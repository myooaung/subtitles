00:00:01,282  -->  00:00:05,025
<v ->Alright, if you still haven't got enough of this game,</v>
2

2

00:00:05,025  -->  00:00:06,406
then here come not one,
3

3

00:00:06,406  -->  00:00:07,462
not two,
4

4

00:00:07,462  -->  00:00:10,879
but three coding challenges just for you.
5

5

00:00:12,077  -->  00:00:13,722
So after finishing this game,
6

6

00:00:13,722  -->  00:00:16,503
I had three ideas about things,
7

7

00:00:16,503  -->  00:00:19,288
about rules that we could change in this game.
8

8

00:00:19,288  -->  00:00:20,121
So I thought,
9

9

00:00:20,121  -->  00:00:22,105
that these were three really cool challenges
10

10

00:00:22,105  -->  00:00:23,805
for you to do.
11

11

00:00:23,805  -->  00:00:25,461
So here they are.
12

12

00:00:25,461  -->  00:00:26,997
So the first one is
13

13

00:00:26,997  -->  00:00:29,833
that a player loses his entire score
14

14

00:00:29,833  -->  00:00:32,630
when he rolls two six in a row.
15

15

00:00:32,630  -->  00:00:34,035
So not just the round score,
16

16

00:00:34,035  -->  00:00:36,355
but really all of his score.
17

17

00:00:36,355  -->  00:00:38,121
So two six in a row
18

18

00:00:38,121  -->  00:00:40,720
and then the player loses his entire score.
19

19

00:00:40,720  -->  00:00:41,553
And then, of course,
20

20

00:00:41,553  -->  00:00:44,261
is the next player after that.
21

21

00:00:44,261  -->  00:00:46,155
And one hint that I can give you about this
22

22

00:00:46,155  -->  00:00:49,153
is that you should always save your previous dice roll
23

23

00:00:49,153  -->  00:00:50,589
in a separate variable,
24

24

00:00:50,589  -->  00:00:52,304
so that you can access the present
25

25

00:00:52,304  -->  00:00:55,351
and the past dice roll at the same time.
26

26

00:00:55,351  -->  00:00:58,039
The second one is that you add an input field
27

27

00:00:58,039  -->  00:01:00,734
to the HTML where the players can,
28

28

00:01:00,734  -->  00:01:01,651
by themselves,
29

29

00:01:01,651  -->  00:01:02,829
set the winning score.
30

30

00:01:02,829  -->  00:01:07,320
And so they can change the predefined score of 100.
31

31

00:01:07,320  -->  00:01:08,680
And again, I have a hint.
32

32

00:01:08,680  -->  00:01:10,587
So in order to read the value
33

33

00:01:10,587  -->  00:01:11,562
from the input field,
34

34

00:01:11,562  -->  00:01:15,011
you can use the .value property in JavaScript.
35

35

00:01:15,011  -->  00:01:17,265
And if you can't manage to make this working,
36

36

00:01:17,265  -->  00:01:20,120
then this is a good case for you to use Google
37

37

00:01:20,120  -->  00:01:22,636
to figure out the problem.
38

38

00:01:22,636  -->  00:01:24,418
This 100 here brings me
39

39

00:01:24,418  -->  00:01:26,934
to correcting what we still had here,
40

40

00:01:26,934  -->  00:01:28,421
so we still had a 20,
41

41

00:01:28,421  -->  00:01:29,329
but of course,
42

42

00:01:29,329  -->  00:01:33,496
the original rule was that the game ended at 100 points.
43

43

00:01:35,535  -->  00:01:37,245
Alright, so the third challenge is
44

44

00:01:37,245  -->  00:01:39,498
to add a second dice to the game
45

45

00:01:39,498  -->  00:01:40,860
and in this scenario,
46

46

00:01:40,860  -->  00:01:42,600
the player loses his current score
47

47

00:01:42,600  -->  00:01:45,374
when only one of them is an one.
48

48

00:01:45,374  -->  00:01:46,207
And for this one,
49

49

00:01:46,207  -->  00:01:48,478
you're going to need some CSS and of course,
50

50

00:01:48,478  -->  00:01:51,020
HTML to position the second dice.
51

51

00:01:51,020  -->  00:01:52,939
So if you have a hard time with that,
52

52

00:01:52,939  -->  00:01:54,770
you can just look at the CSS code
53

53

00:01:54,770  -->  00:01:57,051
that I provided for you.
54

54

00:01:57,051  -->  00:01:58,665
And if you still can't manage to do that,
55

55

00:01:58,665  -->  00:01:59,512
to position the dice,
56

56

00:01:59,512  -->  00:02:02,008
then you can simply watch that part of the solution,
57

57

00:02:02,008  -->  00:02:02,983
right?
58

58

00:02:02,983  -->  00:02:05,524
So I really encourage you to do all of these
59

59

00:02:05,524  -->  00:02:06,805
three challenges,
60

60

00:02:06,805  -->  00:02:08,716
because this really allows you
61

61

00:02:08,716  -->  00:02:11,131
to get immediate practice with the coding,
62

62

00:02:11,131  -->  00:02:14,987
but also with the thinking about the solutions.
63

63

00:02:14,987  -->  00:02:16,217
So that's really the best thing
64

64

00:02:16,217  -->  00:02:18,172
that you can do right now,
65

65

00:02:18,172  -->  00:02:20,361
if you really want to learn JavaScript
66

66

00:02:20,361  -->  00:02:23,962
and that is why I designed these challenges for you.
67

67

00:02:23,962  -->  00:02:24,795
Okay,
68

68

00:02:24,795  -->  00:02:25,931
and after you did all of them,
69

69

00:02:25,931  -->  00:02:27,348
then you can just check the solutions
70

70

00:02:27,348  -->  00:02:30,515
that I have for you in the next video.
