00:00:01,250  -->  00:00:03,897
<v Jonas>Welcome back to the last and most exciting</v>
2

2

00:00:03,897  -->  00:00:07,449
coding challenge of this section.
3

3

00:00:07,449  -->  00:00:09,087
So, remember the tip calculator
4

4

00:00:09,087  -->  00:00:11,342
that we created in another challenge.
5

5

00:00:11,342  -->  00:00:13,568
Let's now create a more advanced version
6

6

00:00:13,568  -->  00:00:16,725
using everything that we learned up until this point.
7

7

00:00:16,725  -->  00:00:18,656
So this time, John and his family
8

8

00:00:18,656  -->  00:00:20,801
went to five different restaurants.
9

9

00:00:20,801  -->  00:00:25,218
And the bills were 124, 48, 268, 180, and 42 dollars.
10

10

00:00:26,946  -->  00:00:28,894
And again, John likes to tip 20 percent
11

11

00:00:28,894  -->  00:00:31,650
of the bill, when it is less than 50 dollars,
12

12

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:34,840
50 percent if it's between 50 and 200,
13

13

00:00:34,840  -->  00:00:38,242
and 10 percent if the bill is more than 200 dollars.
14

14

00:00:38,242  -->  00:00:39,075
Alright?
15

15

00:00:39,075  -->  00:00:40,902
So, implement a tip calculator
16

16

00:00:40,902  -->  00:00:43,861
using objects and loops this time.
17

17

00:00:43,861  -->  00:00:46,013
So here are the steps for doing that,
18

18

00:00:46,013  -->  00:00:47,385
in order to help you.
19

19

00:00:47,385  -->  00:00:49,274
So, first create an object with
20

20

00:00:49,274  -->  00:00:51,507
an array for the bill values.
21

21

00:00:51,507  -->  00:00:54,040
Then, add a method to calculate the tip,
22

22

00:00:54,040  -->  00:00:56,588
and this method should of course include a loop,
23

23

00:00:56,588  -->  00:00:58,924
to iterate over all the paid bills,
24

24

00:00:58,924  -->  00:01:01,091
and to do the tip calculations.
25

25

00:01:01,091  -->  00:01:04,382
Then, as an output, you should again create two arrays.
26

26

00:01:04,382  -->  00:01:06,604
One containing all the paid tips,
27

27

00:01:06,604  -->  00:01:10,100
and two, containing all the final paid amount.
28

28

00:01:10,100  -->  00:01:13,056
So again, the bill plus the tip. Alright?
29

29

00:01:13,056  -->  00:01:14,973
And a hint that I have to give you here
30

30

00:01:14,973  -->  00:01:18,247
is that you can start with two empty arrays
31

31

00:01:18,247  -->  00:01:21,652
as properties, and then fill them up in the loop.
32

32

00:01:21,652  -->  00:01:22,485
Okay?
33

33

00:01:22,485  -->  00:01:24,993
So an empty array is just like this here.
34

34

00:01:24,993  -->  00:01:26,853
And you can start with two empty arrays,
35

35

00:01:26,853  -->  00:01:29,901
one for just number one, so all the tips,
36

36

00:01:29,901  -->  00:01:33,140
and then two, for all the final paid amounts.
37

37

00:01:33,140  -->  00:01:35,874
So start with these two as empty arrays
38

38

00:01:35,874  -->  00:01:38,626
and then in a loop, you can fill them up.
39

39

00:01:38,626  -->  00:01:39,459
Alright?
40

40

00:01:39,459  -->  00:01:41,168
So that is already a lot of work,
41

41

00:01:41,168  -->  00:01:44,665
but after that, I even have like a step two for you.
42

42

00:01:44,665  -->  00:01:48,099
So, to even take it to the next level.
43

43

00:01:48,099  -->  00:01:51,390
And that is, that Mark's family also went on a holiday.
44

44

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:54,572
And they are going to four different restaurants.
45

45

00:01:54,572  -->  00:01:56,246
And the bill that they paid were
46

46

00:01:56,246  -->  00:01:58,663
77, 375, 110, and 45 dollars.
47

47

00:02:01,854  -->  00:02:03,561
And Mark has a slightly different
48

48

00:02:03,561  -->  00:02:05,359
rules when it comes to tipping.
49

49

00:02:05,359  -->  00:02:07,096
So he likes to tip 20 percent,
50

50

00:02:07,096  -->  00:02:09,270
if the bill is less than 100 dollars,
51

51

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:13,060
10 percent, when the bill is between 100 and 300 dollars,
52

52

00:02:13,060  -->  00:02:17,040
and 25 percent if the bill is more than 300 dollars.
53

53

00:02:17,040  -->  00:02:17,873
Okay?
54

54

00:02:17,873  -->  00:02:20,047
So again, that doesn't make much sense maybe,
55

55

00:02:20,047  -->  00:02:23,179
but that's just again, to make it a bit more exciting,
56

56

00:02:23,179  -->  00:02:25,178
and to make these two tipping functions
57

57

00:02:25,178  -->  00:02:28,177
different for each of the persons.
58

58

00:02:28,177  -->  00:02:29,010
Okay?
59

59

00:02:29,010  -->  00:02:30,269
So, I want you to implement the same
60

60

00:02:30,269  -->  00:02:33,114
functionality as before, but this time of course,
61

61

00:02:33,114  -->  00:02:34,890
using Mark's tipping rules.
62

62

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:38,019
Then create a function, and I don't mean a method.
63

63

00:02:38,019  -->  00:02:40,152
So, like an outside function to calculate
64

64

00:02:40,152  -->  00:02:43,455
the average of a given array of tips.
65

65

00:02:43,455  -->  00:02:45,264
And here I have to give you another hint,
66

66

00:02:45,264  -->  00:02:46,367
because up until this point,
67

67

00:02:46,367  -->  00:02:48,311
we never did anything like this.
68

68

00:02:48,311  -->  00:02:51,237
Okay and so I give you a hint here to calculate the average.
69

69

00:02:51,237  -->  00:02:53,631
And that is that you should loop over the array,
70

70

00:02:53,631  -->  00:02:56,467
and in each iteration, store the current sum
71

71

00:02:56,467  -->  00:02:59,050
in a variable which starts from zero.
72

72

00:02:59,050  -->  00:03:00,960
Then after you have the sum of the array,
73

73

00:03:00,960  -->  00:03:02,280
then you'll simply divide it by
74

74

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:04,312
the number of elements in it.
75

75

00:03:04,312  -->  00:03:07,326
Okay? So that's the formula for calculating averages.
76

76

00:03:07,326  -->  00:03:09,006
So if that's a bit too difficult for you,
77

77

00:03:09,006  -->  00:03:13,046
then you can just stop maybe after point five.
78

78

00:03:13,046  -->  00:03:13,879
Okay?
79

79

00:03:13,879  -->  00:03:15,831
But I would like you to try out,
80

80

00:03:15,831  -->  00:03:17,641
to calculate the average, alright?
81

81

00:03:17,641  -->  00:03:20,006
So that's here on number seven,
82

82

00:03:20,006  -->  00:03:21,295
so you use the function that you
83

83

00:03:21,295  -->  00:03:22,883
created in number six to actually
84

84

00:03:22,883  -->  00:03:25,463
calculate the average for both families.
85

85

00:03:25,463  -->  00:03:27,016
And then you'll log to the console
86

86

00:03:27,016  -->  00:03:30,328
which family paid the highest tips on average.
87

87

00:03:30,328  -->  00:03:31,161
Alright?
88

88

00:03:31,161  -->  00:03:33,054
So, again, this one is a bit tricky maybe,
89

89

00:03:33,054  -->  00:03:36,536
so you can, no problem, take an hour or even more
90

90

00:03:36,536  -->  00:03:39,135
to try to accomplish this, alright?
91

91

00:03:39,135  -->  00:03:40,782
I think it's really important for your
92

92

00:03:40,782  -->  00:03:42,530
learning process to go through
93

93

00:03:42,530  -->  00:03:44,488
something like this, a bit more difficult even,
94

94

00:03:44,488  -->  00:03:46,045
so that you really have to try,
95

95

00:03:46,045  -->  00:03:47,730
instead of it being super easy.
96

96

00:03:47,730  -->  00:03:50,567
Because then you don't really learn anything, okay?
97

97

00:03:50,567  -->  00:03:52,172
So take an hour or something like that to
98

98

00:03:52,172  -->  00:03:54,102
really go through this and really try
99

99

00:03:54,102  -->  00:03:55,633
to solve these problems.
100

100

00:03:55,633  -->  00:03:57,788
Alright? You don't need to be fast.
101

101

00:03:57,788  -->  00:03:59,447
Then if there are some parts that
102

102

00:03:59,447  -->  00:04:01,103
you cannot figure out, again, no problem,
103

103

00:04:01,103  -->  00:04:05,520
you can just check out my solution in the next video.
