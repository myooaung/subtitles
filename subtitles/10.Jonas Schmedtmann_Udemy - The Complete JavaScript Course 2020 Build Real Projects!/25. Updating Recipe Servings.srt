00:00:01,390  -->  00:00:02,250
<v Instructor>Alright.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,250  -->  00:00:05,040
Let's now finish up this recipe part
3

3

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:09,130
by updating the servings, and the ingredient list
4

4

00:00:09,130  -->  00:00:12,110
whenever we click the increase or decrease buttons.
5

5

00:00:12,110  -->  00:00:14,170
And, so you're actually gonna learn something new
6

6

00:00:14,170  -->  00:00:17,200
in this video that we haven't talked about yet.
7

7

00:00:17,200  -->  00:00:20,550
Which is another way of implementing the event delegation
8

8

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:23,733
using the matches method on DOM elements.
9

9

00:00:24,590  -->  00:00:28,810
So again, the idea is to decrease or increase
10

10

00:00:28,810  -->  00:00:31,850
both the servings, and the ingredients here
11

11

00:00:31,850  -->  00:00:34,210
whenever we hit these two buttons.
12

12

00:00:34,210  -->  00:00:35,043
Okay?
13

13

00:00:35,043  -->  00:00:37,083
So let's start with a model here.
14

14

00:00:39,040  -->  00:00:43,113
And, I'm adding a new method here called update servings.
15

15

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:51,580
And, so we actually need to update servings,
16

16

00:00:51,580  -->  00:00:53,583
and also the ingredients.
17

17

00:00:56,482  -->  00:00:57,315
Okay.
18

18

00:00:57,315  -->  00:00:59,710
And, we actually need also a parameter
19

19

00:00:59,710  -->  00:01:02,360
to this method here called type.
20

20

00:01:02,360  -->  00:01:05,460
Okay, and so that in here can pass like a string saying,
21

21

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:08,970
decrease, or increase in order to decide if we need to
22

22

00:01:08,970  -->  00:01:11,357
increase the servings, or to decrease.
23

23

00:01:11,357  -->  00:01:12,380
Okay?
24

24

00:01:12,380  -->  00:01:15,130
So basically, if we hit the minus button, then we will
25

25

00:01:15,130  -->  00:01:17,670
pass in decrease, and if we hit the plus button,
26

26

00:01:17,670  -->  00:01:19,420
then we pass in increase.
27

27

00:01:19,420  -->  00:01:20,950
Okay?
28

28

00:01:20,950  -->  00:01:23,633
So let's create a variable called new servings.
29

29

00:01:25,860  -->  00:01:27,738
That will be set according to the type.
30

30

00:01:27,738  -->  00:01:28,790
Okay?
31

31

00:01:28,790  -->  00:01:31,840
So let's use the (unintelligible) operator here.
32

32

00:01:31,840  -->  00:01:35,810
And, say if it's thick, so it stands for decreasing.
33

33

00:01:35,810  -->  00:01:38,480
Well, then this.servings
34

34

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:41,093
minus one
35

35

00:01:43,641  -->  00:01:44,474
is
36

36

00:01:47,870  -->  00:01:49,420
plus one. Okay?
37

37

00:01:49,420  -->  00:01:51,720
Now, this will not update here this.servings,
38

38

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:55,320
it will simply then assign this value to type.
39

39

00:01:55,320  -->  00:01:56,153
Okay?
40

40

00:01:56,153  -->  00:01:57,027
Or, sorry it will actually just
41

41

00:01:57,027  -->  00:01:58,914
assign the value to new servings.
42

42

00:01:58,914  -->  00:01:59,770
Okay?
43

43

00:01:59,770  -->  00:02:03,030
So if type is decrease, then new servings will be
44

44

00:02:03,030  -->  00:02:06,188
this.servings minus one, and otherwise it will be
45

45

00:02:06,188  -->  00:02:08,200
this.servings plus one.
46

46

00:02:08,200  -->  00:02:10,850
But, it will not update right away this.servings.
47

47

00:02:10,850  -->  00:02:13,060
So you have to take care of that later.
48

48

00:02:13,060  -->  00:02:14,910
And, actually we can do it right now.
49

49

00:02:16,210  -->  00:02:17,043
Okay.
50

50

00:02:17,043  -->  00:02:19,120
But, we still need that new servings variable here
51

51

00:02:19,120  -->  00:02:20,590
to calculate the new ingredients.
52

52

00:02:20,590  -->  00:02:22,890
And, that's why we had to calculate it first.
53

53

00:02:22,890  -->  00:02:27,890
So this.servings will be the new servings.
54

54

00:02:29,070  -->  00:02:29,903
Alright.
55

55

00:02:29,903  -->  00:02:31,800
And, now as for the ingredients,
56

56

00:02:31,800  -->  00:02:35,260
well, we need to update all of the count numbers, right?
57

57

00:02:35,260  -->  00:02:36,770
Because the count numbers that we have,
58

58

00:02:36,770  -->  00:02:40,560
they're valid only for the current amount of servings.
59

59

00:02:40,560  -->  00:02:42,590
So, we assume that we have four servings,
60

60

00:02:42,590  -->  00:02:44,710
and that the count that we have in the recipes
61

61

00:02:44,710  -->  00:02:45,910
are perfect for that.
62

62

00:02:45,910  -->  00:02:48,630
So, if we then decrease or increase the servings,
63

63

00:02:48,630  -->  00:02:50,610
then we also have to update the counts.
64

64

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:53,400
And, we're gonna have to do that for all of the ingredients.
65

65

00:02:53,400  -->  00:02:56,100
So, this.ingredients, and remember
66

66

00:02:56,100  -->  00:02:57,360
that this is an array.
67

67

00:02:57,360  -->  00:02:59,003
And, so let's use forEach now.
68

68

00:02:59,920  -->  00:03:01,283
And, forEach ingredient,
69

69

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:04,890
we will have to change the count.
70

70

00:03:04,890  -->  00:03:06,093
So ing.count
71

71

00:03:09,049  -->  00:03:11,136
will be, and remember that ing
72

72

00:03:11,136  -->  00:03:14,147
is the current value forEach loop.
73

73

00:03:14,147  -->  00:03:19,147
And, well the count will be the old count.count
74

74

00:03:20,520  -->  00:03:22,340
times the new servings
75

75

00:03:24,990  -->  00:03:27,330
divided by the old servings, basically.
76

76

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:29,069
So, this.servings.
77

77

00:03:29,069  -->  00:03:30,170
Okay?
78

78

00:03:30,170  -->  00:03:33,750
So, imagine that we had four, and now we have three.
79

79

00:03:33,750  -->  00:03:36,030
So, if we add count before one,
80

80

00:03:36,030  -->  00:03:37,960
then, well before we had four,
81

81

00:03:37,960  -->  00:03:39,177
and now we have three quarters.
82

82

00:03:39,177  -->  00:03:40,230
Okay?
83

83

00:03:40,230  -->  00:03:41,063
So, that makes sense.
84

84

00:03:41,063  -->  00:03:42,370
Now, we can make this even better,
85

85

00:03:42,370  -->  00:03:46,460
because instead of having to repeat the ing.count here,
86

86

00:03:46,460  -->  00:03:49,113
we can simply put the multiply here,
87

87

00:03:50,040  -->  00:03:52,340
and then, this will mean the exact same thing.
88

88

00:03:53,472  -->  00:03:54,370
Alright.
89

89

00:03:54,370  -->  00:03:58,300
And, only now we can finally update the this.servings
90

90

00:03:58,300  -->  00:03:59,420
in the object, okay?
91

91

00:03:59,420  -->  00:04:00,970
If we had done this here immediately,
92

92

00:04:00,970  -->  00:04:01,803
then we couldn't use it here.
93

93

00:04:01,803  -->  00:04:02,780
Okay?
94

94

00:04:02,780  -->  00:04:05,380
And, that's why we have to do it afterwards.
95

95

00:04:05,380  -->  00:04:08,710
So, this updates the servings, and both the ingredients
96

96

00:04:08,710  -->  00:04:09,869
in our data model.
97

97

00:04:09,869  -->  00:04:11,640
So, that's the first part,
98

98

00:04:11,640  -->  00:04:13,810
and with that, we're done.
99

99

00:04:13,810  -->  00:04:17,190
Next up, let's go ahead to our controller here,
100

100

00:04:17,190  -->  00:04:20,163
and implement the event handlers for the two buttons.
101

101

00:04:21,310  -->  00:04:22,143
Okay?
102

102

00:04:22,143  -->  00:04:24,560
And, so once more we have to use event delegation
103

103

00:04:24,560  -->  00:04:26,730
because these buttons, they are not yet there
104

104

00:04:26,730  -->  00:04:28,730
by the time we load the page.
105

105

00:04:28,730  -->  00:04:31,640
So, the only thing that is there is the recipe elements.
106

106

00:04:31,640  -->  00:04:32,646
So, all of this.
107

107

00:04:32,646  -->  00:04:34,810
And, so that's where we will have to
108

108

00:04:34,810  -->  00:04:37,330
attach the event lister to, and then use
109

109

00:04:37,330  -->  00:04:40,500
the target property of the event in order to figure out
110

110

00:04:40,500  -->  00:04:41,800
where the click actually happens.
111

111

00:04:41,800  -->  00:04:43,610
So, just like we did before, but in
112

112

00:04:43,610  -->  00:04:46,360
a slightly different form, as you will see in a second.
113

113

00:04:48,070  -->  00:04:50,420
So, handling recipe
114

114

00:04:52,450  -->  00:04:53,870
button clicks.
115

115

00:04:53,870  -->  00:04:54,860
Okay?
116

116

00:04:54,860  -->  00:04:58,140
So, we have our recipe control, and then let's add it here
117

117

00:04:58,140  -->  00:04:59,290
also to the same thing.
118

118

00:04:59,290  -->  00:05:01,940
Later, we will add in some more when tending to this.
119

119

00:05:01,940  -->  00:05:05,240
Because, remember we also have the like button,
120

120

00:05:05,240  -->  00:05:06,570
and the add to list button.
121

121

00:05:06,570  -->  00:05:08,320
But, for now we're just gonna take care of the increasing
122

122

00:05:08,320  -->  00:05:10,113
and decreasing of the servings.
123

123

00:05:11,270  -->  00:05:14,320
So, anyway, let's now attach the event listener
124

124

00:05:14,320  -->  00:05:16,130
to elements.recipe.
125

125

00:05:16,130  -->  00:05:19,340
So, that's the element that's already there at load time.
126

126

00:05:19,340  -->  00:05:21,003
And, then add event listener.
127

127

00:05:23,000  -->  00:05:24,010
Click.
128

128

00:05:24,010  -->  00:05:26,093
And, then we need the event, of course.
129

129

00:05:27,310  -->  00:05:30,580
So that we can then use the target on it.
130

130

00:05:30,580  -->  00:05:33,403
So, last time we did event handling, I showed you
131

131

00:05:33,403  -->  00:05:37,150
the elements.closest, right?
132

132

00:05:37,150  -->  00:05:39,320
Ah, yeah. Here it is. So here is the closest.
133

133

00:05:39,320  -->  00:05:41,520
Now, this time around, we cannot use closest
134

134

00:05:41,520  -->  00:05:43,160
because there is more than one thing
135

135

00:05:43,160  -->  00:05:45,940
that we might potentially want to select, okay?
136

136

00:05:45,940  -->  00:05:48,260
So, here in this case, we knew that we want to select
137

137

00:05:48,260  -->  00:05:49,300
the button in line.
138

138

00:05:49,300  -->  00:05:50,920
The problem was just that there are
139

139

00:05:50,920  -->  00:05:53,830
some elements in there which we could also click on.
140

140

00:05:53,830  -->  00:05:54,663
Okay?
141

141

00:05:54,663  -->  00:05:56,610
But, right now the situation is different
142

142

00:05:56,610  -->  00:05:57,950
because we have different elements
143

143

00:05:57,950  -->  00:05:59,450
that we might want to click on.
144

144

00:05:59,450  -->  00:06:01,950
We have the increase button, we have the decrease button.
145

145

00:06:01,950  -->  00:06:03,730
We later will have the heart button,
146

146

00:06:03,730  -->  00:06:05,120
and the add to list button.
147

147

00:06:05,120  -->  00:06:06,880
And, so we cannot just close this because then it would be
148

148

00:06:06,880  -->  00:06:09,043
impossible to target these different elements.
149

149

00:06:09,043  -->  00:06:11,130
And, so instead what we're going to do, is to basically
150

150

00:06:11,130  -->  00:06:14,900
test what was clicked, and then react accordingly.
151

151

00:06:14,900  -->  00:06:15,733
Okay?
152

152

00:06:15,733  -->  00:06:17,030
And, so this time around, we're gonna use
153

153

00:06:17,030  -->  00:06:20,330
the matches method instead of closest.
154

154

00:06:20,330  -->  00:06:21,260
Okay?
155

155

00:06:21,260  -->  00:06:24,190
So, let's use an if statement.
156

156

00:06:24,190  -->  00:06:29,190
And, so the event.target.matches.
157

157

00:06:29,550  -->  00:06:32,600
And, now in here we can simply pass a css selector
158

158

00:06:32,600  -->  00:06:36,230
just like with document.query selector, for example.
159

159

00:06:36,230  -->  00:06:39,003
So, we can simply say button decrease,
160

160

00:06:40,170  -->  00:06:41,799
which is the class name.
161

161

00:06:41,799  -->  00:06:43,690
So let's take a look at that.
162

162

00:06:43,690  -->  00:06:46,270
So, search view, and that's not the correct one.
163

163

00:06:46,270  -->  00:06:47,103
So, yeah.
164

164

00:06:47,103  -->  00:06:48,085
Recipe view.
165

165

00:06:48,085  -->  00:06:51,540
So, we have here the,
166

166

00:06:51,540  -->  00:06:52,611
where is it?
167

167

00:06:52,611  -->  00:06:53,810
And, actually, I see
168

168

00:06:53,810  -->  00:06:56,380
that we're missing here the class names.
169

169

00:06:56,380  -->  00:06:57,490
Okay?
170

170

00:06:57,490  -->  00:07:02,490
So, let's add button decrease, and button increase.
171

171

00:07:06,950  -->  00:07:08,530
Okay?
172

172

00:07:08,530  -->  00:07:10,540
So, the first must decrease for the minus,
173

173

00:07:10,540  -->  00:07:13,050
and for plus it is increase.
174

174

00:07:13,050  -->  00:07:15,220
So, what we say here, is that we want to do something
175

175

00:07:15,220  -->  00:07:18,470
if the target matches button decrease.
176

176

00:07:18,470  -->  00:07:20,770
Or, we can add a second selector here.
177

177

00:07:20,770  -->  00:07:22,243
Just like we do in css.
178

178

00:07:23,230  -->  00:07:28,230
Button decrease, and then any child.
179

179

00:07:28,410  -->  00:07:30,600
So, that's what this asterisk here means.
180

180

00:07:30,600  -->  00:07:32,450
So that's like the universal selector
181

181

00:07:32,450  -->  00:07:35,010
inside of this parent element.
182

182

00:07:35,010  -->  00:07:37,303
And, let me, not here.
183

183

00:07:37,303  -->  00:07:38,750
And, so let me show you why that is,
184

184

00:07:38,750  -->  00:07:41,460
because again, we might click on this element,
185

185

00:07:41,460  -->  00:07:42,520
or on this element.
186

186

00:07:42,520  -->  00:07:44,790
And, so like this, it will match
187

187

00:07:44,790  -->  00:07:46,100
these two elements here as well.
188

188

00:07:46,100  -->  00:07:46,933
Okay?
189

189

00:07:46,933  -->  00:07:49,940
So, because again, this turns out to be true
190

190

00:07:49,940  -->  00:07:52,620
if the target matches the button decrease,
191

191

00:07:52,620  -->  00:07:55,220
or any child element of the button increase.
192

192

00:07:55,220  -->  00:07:57,510
So, that's what this part here, the selector means.
193

193

00:07:57,510  -->  00:07:58,490
Alright?
194

194

00:07:58,490  -->  00:08:02,953
And, so now, we can then respond to this.
195

195

00:08:08,642  -->  00:08:09,710
It is clicked.
196

196

00:08:09,710  -->  00:08:10,543
Okay?
197

197

00:08:10,543  -->  00:08:11,520
And, now we can go add and copy this
198

198

00:08:11,520  -->  00:08:14,513
because it's pretty much the same for the next one.
199

199

00:08:18,510  -->  00:08:21,090
And, I see that here there is actually a mistake.
200

200

00:08:21,090  -->  00:08:26,033
Let's go ahead and copy this one, and here we want increase.
201

201

00:08:27,500  -->  00:08:28,543
And, here also.
202

202

00:08:33,030  -->  00:08:36,250
So, what do we want to happen in this case is, of course,
203

203

00:08:36,250  -->  00:08:40,783
state the recipe.update servings.
204

204

00:08:44,543  -->  00:08:46,480
And, we pass in decrease.
205

205

00:08:46,480  -->  00:08:49,150
So, that's the string that we define the pass in.
206

206

00:08:49,150  -->  00:08:49,983
Okay?
207

207

00:08:49,983  -->  00:08:52,803
And, then the same here for increase.
208

208

00:08:56,140  -->  00:08:56,973
Alright?
209

209

00:08:56,973  -->  00:08:58,600
And, then just log it to the console.
210

210

00:08:58,600  -->  00:09:00,963
So, the entire recipe.
211

211

00:09:02,680  -->  00:09:03,513
Okay?
212

212

00:09:03,513  -->  00:09:06,540
Just so that we can see the actual serving.
213

213

00:09:06,540  -->  00:09:07,850
'cause right now, it's not yet updated
214

214

00:09:07,850  -->  00:09:09,500
on the user interface, of course.
215

215

00:09:09,500  -->  00:09:10,753
State.recipe.
216

216

00:09:12,670  -->  00:09:13,503
Okay?
217

217

00:09:13,503  -->  00:09:16,127
And, so yeah, let's test it out.
218

218

00:09:20,170  -->  00:09:22,023
Oh, and something is happening.
219

219

00:09:23,030  -->  00:09:26,713
So, you see the servings is now decreased to three.
220

220

00:09:27,550  -->  00:09:28,383
Great.
221

221

00:09:28,383  -->  00:09:30,920
And, now this is at one point five.
222

222

00:09:30,920  -->  00:09:32,670
And, this one here,
223

223

00:09:32,670  -->  00:09:34,030
yeah, this here was the original state.
224

224

00:09:34,030  -->  00:09:36,620
And, so you see that it was two before, right?
225

225

00:09:36,620  -->  00:09:38,440
And, so it's actually working.
226

226

00:09:38,440  -->  00:09:40,420
Even updating here the ingredients.
227

227

00:09:40,420  -->  00:09:42,580
So, you see one cup of mozzarella, and now,
228

228

00:09:42,580  -->  00:09:44,143
it's just zero point 75.
229

229

00:09:44,143  -->  00:09:46,063
And, if I decrease it even further,
230

230

00:09:47,270  -->  00:09:49,113
then let's see what happens now.
231

231

00:09:50,280  -->  00:09:52,490
And, indeed, it's one and zero point five.
232

232

00:09:52,490  -->  00:09:55,850
Now, let's see what happens when I keep clicking
233

233

00:09:55,850  -->  00:09:58,840
and the problem is that we now have negative servings.
234

234

00:09:58,840  -->  00:10:02,310
Minus five, and here we actually have
235

235

00:10:02,310  -->  00:10:04,259
not a number on all of these.
236

236

00:10:04,259  -->  00:10:05,170
Okay?
237

237

00:10:05,170  -->  00:10:06,940
So, this is something we have to fix.
238

238

00:10:06,940  -->  00:10:08,890
And, of course, that's very easy to do.
239

239

00:10:10,120  -->  00:10:14,463
So, we can only do this if state.recipe
240

240

00:10:15,760  -->  00:10:20,123
dot servings is greater than one.
241

241

00:10:22,950  -->  00:10:25,260
Only then we can decrease it more.
242

242

00:10:25,260  -->  00:10:26,093
Okay?
243

243

00:10:26,093  -->  00:10:28,270
And, here the plus, well there is not really a limit.
244

244

00:10:28,270  -->  00:10:30,120
I could put a limit here as well, like,
245

245

00:10:30,120  -->  00:10:32,550
that we cannot put it to 100 people,
246

246

00:10:32,550  -->  00:10:34,540
but that's not really necessary.
247

247

00:10:34,540  -->  00:10:37,670
Okay, and so now finally, let's of course update
248

248

00:10:37,670  -->  00:10:40,263
the user interface as well.
249

249

00:10:41,210  -->  00:10:43,590
And, So I'm gonna add a new method here.
250

250

00:10:43,590  -->  00:10:47,830
Export and update
251

251

00:10:48,980  -->  00:10:51,130
servings again, and let's call it
252

252

00:10:51,130  -->  00:10:52,730
update servings and ingredients.
253

253

00:10:54,840  -->  00:10:55,800
Okay?
254

254

00:10:55,800  -->  00:10:58,780
And, we pass in a recipe,
255

255

00:10:58,780  -->  00:11:01,940
and based on that, we will then update everything.
256

256

00:11:01,940  -->  00:11:02,773
Okay?
257

257

00:11:05,600  -->  00:11:08,720
So, again, we have to update the count,
258

258

00:11:08,720  -->  00:11:13,103
and we have to update the servings, or the ingredients.
259

259

00:11:16,430  -->  00:11:20,403
Okay, so it's not count, it's like the servings themselves.
260

260

00:11:22,100  -->  00:11:24,360
So, the first one should be fairly easy.
261

261

00:11:24,360  -->  00:11:26,290
Document.query selector.
262

262

00:11:26,290  -->  00:11:27,123
And, once again,
263

263

00:11:27,123  -->  00:11:29,640
I have to do query selector here because
264

264

00:11:29,640  -->  00:11:33,230
this element is not yet there by the time we load the page.
265

265

00:11:33,230  -->  00:11:36,410
And, so we're looking for the ingredient count.
266

266

00:11:36,410  -->  00:11:37,830
So, where is that?
267

267

00:11:37,830  -->  00:11:42,150
Servings, it is this weird class in here.
268

268

00:11:42,150  -->  00:11:44,880
And, ideally, we could have some class names that are
269

269

00:11:44,880  -->  00:11:47,360
specifically just for javascript.
270

270

00:11:47,360  -->  00:11:48,330
Okay?
271

271

00:11:48,330  -->  00:11:51,713
But, well, in this case I just did it like this.
272

272

00:11:52,840  -->  00:11:53,673
So, no big deal.
273

273

00:11:53,673  -->  00:11:55,063
It still works, obviously.
274

274

00:11:56,320  -->  00:12:00,130
Okay, and so now, just changing the text content to
275

275

00:12:00,130  -->  00:12:03,523
recipe.servings, and that's it.
276

276

00:12:04,420  -->  00:12:05,950
So, this one is very simple.
277

277

00:12:05,950  -->  00:12:07,770
And, now onto the next one.
278

278

00:12:07,770  -->  00:12:09,880
So, basically what I'm going to do here is to select
279

279

00:12:09,880  -->  00:12:11,620
all of the ingredient counts,
280

280

00:12:11,620  -->  00:12:13,550
and then update them one by one.
281

281

00:12:13,550  -->  00:12:15,570
So, let's take a look at that.
282

282

00:12:15,570  -->  00:12:20,570
So, recipe count is their name, alright?
283

283

00:12:20,660  -->  00:12:22,513
So, I'm gonna go ahead and copy it.
284

284

00:12:23,600  -->  00:12:27,630
And, so, let's start by saving the selection here, actually.
285

285

00:12:27,630  -->  00:12:29,448
So, count elements.
286

286

00:12:29,448  -->  00:12:32,600
Okay?
287

287

00:12:32,600  -->  00:12:35,741
So, array.from, and now we do our
288

288

00:12:35,741  -->  00:12:38,313
document.query selector all.
289

289

00:12:41,800  -->  00:12:43,398
From recipe count.
290

290

00:12:43,398  -->  00:12:45,320
Okay.
291

291

00:12:45,320  -->  00:12:46,970
And, now what do we do with this?
292

292

00:12:49,070  -->  00:12:52,360
Well, we do a simple forEach loop.
293

293

00:12:52,360  -->  00:12:54,670
And, now in here we actually need the element,
294

294

00:12:54,670  -->  00:12:56,350
and also the index.
295

295

00:12:56,350  -->  00:12:58,343
And, you will see why in a second.
296

296

00:12:59,840  -->  00:13:02,720
So, we're gonna change the text content
297

297

00:13:02,720  -->  00:13:04,950
of each of this element.
298

298

00:13:04,950  -->  00:13:06,450
And, what do we change it to?
299

299

00:13:06,450  -->  00:13:09,230
Well, first of all, we use the format count function
300

300

00:13:09,230  -->  00:13:10,555
that we used before.
301

301

00:13:10,555  -->  00:13:12,880
And, what we're gonna put in here
302

302

00:13:12,880  -->  00:13:15,351
is the recipe.ingredients.
303

303

00:13:15,351  -->  00:13:18,430
Remember that is the array.
304

304

00:13:18,430  -->  00:13:21,238
And, now at position i.count.
305

305

00:13:21,238  -->  00:13:23,283
Okay?
306

306

00:13:24,870  -->  00:13:25,703
Make sense?
307

307

00:13:25,703  -->  00:13:27,770
And, that's why we needed the i here.
308

308

00:13:27,770  -->  00:13:30,730
Because basically, we're looping over two arrays here
309

309

00:13:30,730  -->  00:13:33,210
at the same time, so we have the recipe.ingredient
310

310

00:13:33,210  -->  00:13:37,210
array, and the count elements array.
311

311

00:13:37,210  -->  00:13:38,180
So, we're using forEach.
312

312

00:13:38,180  -->  00:13:39,780
On this one, and then also
313

313

00:13:39,780  -->  00:13:43,160
using the current index to retrieve the value from
314

314

00:13:43,160  -->  00:13:44,320
the ingredients array.
315

315

00:13:44,320  -->  00:13:45,750
We could have done it the other way around,
316

316

00:13:45,750  -->  00:13:48,400
so that forEach could be on the recipe.ingredients.
317

317

00:13:48,400  -->  00:13:51,880
And, then we would use the index on the counter elements.
318

318

00:13:51,880  -->  00:13:55,193
So anyway, things should now be actually working already.
319

319

00:13:56,900  -->  00:13:59,373
So, let's wait for the reloading of it,
320

320

00:14:00,709  -->  00:14:02,290
and let's try it out.
321

321

00:14:02,290  -->  00:14:03,890
Well, that didn't really happen.
322

322

00:14:04,790  -->  00:14:08,400
I guess that's because we didn't really
323

323

00:14:08,400  -->  00:14:09,920
call this function here.
324

324

00:14:09,920  -->  00:14:12,400
So, that's a stupid mistake.
325

325

00:14:12,400  -->  00:14:17,400
So, recipe view.update server ingredients,
326

326

00:14:17,520  -->  00:14:21,853
and in there we pass the recipe, so state.recipe.
327

327

00:14:23,130  -->  00:14:26,940
And, the same, of course, also for the case that
328

328

00:14:26,940  -->  00:14:28,930
we increase the serving.
329

329

00:14:28,930  -->  00:14:29,980
Okay?
330

330

00:14:29,980  -->  00:14:33,610
So, now we should be ready to rock.
331

331

00:14:33,610  -->  00:14:36,975
So, let's try it, and here we go.
332

332

00:14:36,975  -->  00:14:39,240
It's working.
333

333

00:14:39,240  -->  00:14:41,000
That's fantastic.
334

334

00:14:41,000  -->  00:14:44,050
So, we can increase it as we wish.
335

335

00:14:44,050  -->  00:14:46,250
Now, that's try to increase it even further.
336

336

00:14:46,250  -->  00:14:48,793
And, it stops at one, just as we defined.
337

337

00:14:49,830  -->  00:14:52,770
Okay? So, perfect. Awesome. It's really working.
338

338

00:14:52,770  -->  00:14:56,460
And, so with this, we actually finished this section.
339

339

00:14:56,460  -->  00:14:58,700
Well, we're gonna add some more stuff here.
340

340

00:14:58,700  -->  00:15:00,400
Namely, this like button.
341

341

00:15:00,400  -->  00:15:01,660
And, this button here.
342

342

00:15:01,660  -->  00:15:03,900
But, for now, it is really working.
343

343

00:15:03,900  -->  00:15:06,080
And, so I hope you're proud of yourself
344

344

00:15:06,080  -->  00:15:08,730
for making it this far into the project.
345

345

00:15:08,730  -->  00:15:12,270
Next up, we're gonna take care of this shopping list.
346

346

00:15:12,270  -->  00:15:14,340
So, if you still want to continue this momentum,
347

347

00:15:14,340  -->  00:15:16,763
well, then just join me right in the next video.
