2

00:00:02.569  -->  00:00:06.607 line:15% 
what HTML and CSS are, you're in the right place
3

3

00:00:06.607  -->  00:00:09.988 line:15% 
because in this lecture I am going to very quickly go over
4

4

00:00:09.988  -->  00:00:13.375 line:15% 
the most important parts of HTML and CSS,
5

5

00:00:13.375  -->  00:00:15.756 line:15% 
just by looking at the project
6

6

00:00:15.756  -->  00:00:19.590 line:15% 
that we will be working on in this section,
7

7

00:00:19.590  -->  00:00:22.721 line:15% 
so if you're already familiar with HTML and CSS,
8

8

00:00:22.721  -->  00:00:26.766 line:15% 
then please feel free to mark this lecture as completed
9

9

00:00:26.766  -->  00:00:30.795 line:15% 
and then move on straight to the next one.
10

10

00:00:30.795  -->  00:00:33.473
This is the starter code of the project
11

11

00:00:33.473  -->  00:00:36.796
that we will be working on in this section,
12

12

00:00:36.796  -->  00:00:39.675
and this here is an HTML document.
13

13

00:00:39.675  -->  00:00:43.140
All right, so an HTML document is what always holds
14

14

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:46.082
the content of our web pages.
15

15

00:00:46.082  -->  00:00:49.679
In HTML we have elements which are composed of
16

16

00:00:49.679  -->  00:00:52.702
ending tags, content, and closing tags,
17

17

00:00:52.702  -->  00:00:54.901
in most of the cases.
18

18

00:00:54.901  -->  00:00:57.814
We then write these elements into one another
19

19

00:00:57.814  -->  00:01:01.194
and like this create a nested structure,
20

20

00:01:01.194  -->  00:01:04.187
and there are different elements for different things,
21

21

00:01:04.187  -->  00:01:08.354
such as links, paragraphs, images, sections, et cetera.
22

22

00:01:10.121  -->  00:01:14.288
For example, the div tag here has this opening tag,
23

23

00:01:15.969  -->  00:01:20.136
this closing tag, and this content here in between,
24

24

00:01:21.334  -->  00:01:24.400
and in this case the content itself are
25

25

00:01:24.400  -->  00:01:27.475
even more HTML elements, but eventually
26

26

00:01:27.475  -->  00:01:32.065
some of these elements have some plain text content here.
27

27

00:01:32.065  -->  00:01:35.617
For example, here, or here, or here.
28

28

00:01:35.617  -->  00:01:39.604
Okay, so HTML elements can also have attributes,
29

29

00:01:39.604  -->  00:01:42.621
which are these, so this is the class attribute,
30

30

00:01:42.621  -->  00:01:45.593
the id attribute, or for example,
31

31

00:01:45.593  -->  00:01:48.010
the source or alt attributes,
32

32

00:01:49.685  -->  00:01:52.514
and there are a lot of different attributes.
33

33

00:01:52.514  -->  00:01:55.562
Now, probably the most used one is actually
34

34

00:01:55.562  -->  00:01:58.616
the class attribute, which is this one here,
35

35

00:01:58.616  -->  00:02:02.745
and it allows us to give a certain element a name,
36

36

00:02:02.745  -->  00:02:05.856
and ids, which have for example here,
37

37

00:02:05.856  -->  00:02:08.815
also allow us to give elements a name,
38

38

00:02:08.815  -->  00:02:12.094
but the difference is that an id has to be unique,
39

39

00:02:12.094  -->  00:02:14.896
but a class name can be used over and over again
40

40

00:02:14.896  -->  00:02:17.246
throughout the pages.
41

41

00:02:17.246  -->  00:02:20.726
For example, we have player-name here,
42

42

00:02:20.726  -->  00:02:24.282
and then down here again, but we have, for example,
43

43

00:02:24.282  -->  00:02:26.199
the id name-0 only here
44

44

00:02:27.640  -->  00:02:31.324
because down here it's called name-1.
45

45

00:02:31.324  -->  00:02:34.545
All right, so these are elements and attributes.
46

46

00:02:34.545  -->  00:02:37.495
Now about the structure of an HTML document.
47

47

00:02:37.495  -->  00:02:40.260
It is always divided into two parts,
48

48

00:02:40.260  -->  00:02:43.134
which are the header and the body,
49

49

00:02:43.134  -->  00:02:45.672
so the body is what we just looked at,
50

50

00:02:45.672  -->  00:02:49.835
and it contains the visible content of a web page,
51

51

00:02:49.835  -->  00:02:51.870
and so it's basically everything that's here
52

52

00:02:51.870  -->  00:02:54.370
enclosed into these body tags.
53

53

00:02:56.061  -->  00:02:57.901
So that's it for the body.
54

54

00:02:57.901  -->  00:03:01.007
Now the header is what contains additional information
55

55

00:03:01.007  -->  00:03:04.565
about a web page, such as the title here
56

56

00:03:04.565  -->  00:03:07.439
or even some page keywords,
57

57

00:03:07.439  -->  00:03:09.868
and we can also do other things here.
58

58

00:03:09.868  -->  00:03:14.055
For example, in here we import into our code
59

59

00:03:14.055  -->  00:03:18.826
a custom font from Google fonts and also an icon font
60

60

00:03:18.826  -->  00:03:22.568
which will give us some nice icons that we can use
61

61

00:03:22.568  -->  00:03:26.146
to make our interface look nicer.
62

62

00:03:26.146  -->  00:03:30.273
And in here in the next line, but also still in the head
63

63

00:03:30.273  -->  00:03:33.931
of the HTML document, we connect our HTML file
64

64

00:03:33.931  -->  00:03:37.681
to a CSS style sheet, which brings me to CSS.
65

65

00:03:39.733  -->  00:03:43.331
So let us open our external CSS file,
66

66

00:03:43.331  -->  00:03:45.502
which is this one here.
67

67

00:03:45.502  -->  00:03:48.427
Okay, so if HTML is the content of the web page,
68

68

00:03:48.427  -->  00:03:52.142
then CSS is the presentation, and here in the CSS
69

69

00:03:52.142  -->  00:03:55.809
we simply write rules to style our web page.
70

70

00:03:56.673  -->  00:03:59.507
So we have all these rules here,
71

71

00:03:59.507  -->  00:04:02.381
so here and here and all the way,
72

72

00:04:02.381  -->  00:04:06.686
so all this file is filled with CSS rules,
73

73

00:04:06.686  -->  00:04:10.465
and the way we connect the HTML with the CSS is
74

74

00:04:10.465  -->  00:04:13.605
by using, usually, class names.
75

75

00:04:13.605  -->  00:04:16.624
We can also use ids or other selectors,
76

76

00:04:16.624  -->  00:04:19.673
but the most common one is the class selector,
77

77

00:04:19.673  -->  00:04:23.592
so this is the class name that we specify in the HTML.
78

78

00:04:23.592  -->  00:04:27.169
Let's go look at that, so player-name,
79

79

00:04:27.169  -->  00:04:30.786
and that is right here, so the rule that we just saw
80

80

00:04:30.786  -->  00:04:34.036
here in the CSS styles all the elements
81

81

00:04:35.115  -->  00:04:37.773
which have the class of player-name,
82

82

00:04:37.773  -->  00:04:40.832
and this here is the class selector,
83

83

00:04:40.832  -->  00:04:44.637
in if we go up here, we see another selector,
84

84

00:04:44.637  -->  00:04:46.974
which, for example, we have this one here,
85

85

00:04:46.974  -->  00:04:49.723
and this is simply, this is called a type selector
86

86

00:04:49.723  -->  00:04:53.971
because it selects all the elements with a type of body,
87

87

00:04:53.971  -->  00:04:57.804
so it simply selects the body of our web page.
88

88

00:04:58.702  -->  00:05:00.975
And we also have the universal selector,
89

89

00:05:00.975  -->  00:05:03.942
which simply selects all of the elements on the web page
90

90

00:05:03.942  -->  00:05:07.275
and applies these styles to all of them.
91

91

00:05:08.155  -->  00:05:12.212
Okay, so I think that is actually all I had to tell you.
92

92

00:05:12.212  -->  00:05:17.057
I hope that you got a small idea about HTML and CSS now.
93

93

00:05:17.057  -->  00:05:20.030
This should absolutely be enough to allow you
94

94

00:05:20.030  -->  00:05:22.218
to follow the next lectures
95

95

00:05:22.218  -->  00:05:25.340
where we are going to need some of these concepts.
96

96

00:05:25.340  -->  00:05:29.893
If you want a full deep-dive training into HTML and CSS,
97

97

00:05:29.893  -->  00:05:32.901
then of course you can try out my other course
98

98

00:05:32.901  -->  00:05:36.246
which is called "Build Responsive Real-World Web Sites
99

99

00:05:36.246  -->  00:05:38.163
with HTML 5 and CSS 3".
