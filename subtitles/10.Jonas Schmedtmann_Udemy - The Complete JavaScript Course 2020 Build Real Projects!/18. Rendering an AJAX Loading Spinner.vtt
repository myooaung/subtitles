00:00:01.180  -->  00:00:02.930
<v Instructor>Let's continue where we left off</v>
2

2

00:00:02.930  -->  00:00:06.113
in the last video, and build our loading spinner.
3

3

00:00:07.100  -->  00:00:08.790
And in order to implement the spinner
4

4

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:10.870
as best as possible, let's remember
5

5

00:00:10.870  -->  00:00:13.460
that it should appear here in the search results list,
6

6

00:00:13.460  -->  00:00:16.624
but also here in the recipe whenever we click
7

7

00:00:16.624  -->  00:00:19.940
on one of these results here, okay?
8

8

00:00:19.940  -->  00:00:21.470
So, we should have that in mind
9

9

00:00:21.470  -->  00:00:24.383
and build the spinner, this loader for reusability.
10

10

00:00:25.377  -->  00:00:28.630
Okay, and so actually let's not include it
11

11

00:00:28.630  -->  00:00:33.150
in the search view, but in base.js, okay?
12

12

00:00:33.150  -->  00:00:34.910
Because again, this is not really just
13

13

00:00:34.910  -->  00:00:36.840
for the search, but we're gonna use it
14

14

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:39.080
later also in the recipes, okay?
15

15

00:00:39.080  -->  00:00:42.490
And so, base here is, basically where you put the styles
16

16

00:00:42.490  -->  00:00:44.410
that are reusable and other stuff,
17

17

00:00:44.410  -->  00:00:46.440
like these elements, they're also being used
18

18

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:49.540
and reused across different modules.
19

19

00:00:49.540  -->  00:00:54.540
So let's say export + const + render the loader, okay?
20

20

00:00:56.420  -->  00:00:58.420
And now we actually want to pass one argument
21

21

00:00:58.420  -->  00:01:01.823
into this loader, and that is the parent element.
22

22

00:01:04.690  -->  00:01:07.460
Okay, so remember what I mentioned in the beginning
23

23

00:01:07.460  -->  00:01:09.910
that we will do this loader here for reusability,
24

24

00:01:10.879  -->  00:01:13.200
and so the best way of doing this is to pass in the parent
25

25

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:16.120
and then say that we want to attach this loader here
26

26

00:01:16.120  -->  00:01:17.619
as a child element of the parent.
27

27

00:01:17.619  -->  00:01:20.190
And so, in the case of this list here
28

28

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:21.750
we can pass in this parent element here
29

29

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:24.340
so that the loader will be attached to this,
30

30

00:01:24.340  -->  00:01:25.850
and if it's the recipe, we can then
31

31

00:01:25.850  -->  00:01:28.165
pass in this parent element.
32

32

00:01:28.165  -->  00:01:31.760
All right, so, let's create a variable
33

33

00:01:31.760  -->  00:01:36.129
const + loader, and then using the template string method,
34

34

00:01:36.129  -->  00:01:37.833
that I showed you before.
35

35

00:01:39.371  -->  00:01:43.130
So we're just going to write some HTML here.
36

36

00:01:43.130  -->  00:01:44.880
This one I can't copy from anywhere,
37

37

00:01:44.880  -->  00:01:46.480
so let's just write it out here.
38

38

00:01:49.334  -->  00:01:51.418
And actually even inside of Javascript here,
39

39

00:01:51.418  -->  00:01:53.910
this HTML still gets autocompleted,
40

40

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:55.513
which is pretty amazing I think.
41

41

00:01:56.640  -->  00:01:59.500
So we have this div with the loader class,
42

42

00:01:59.500  -->  00:02:01.573
and then in there we have an SVG,
43

43

00:02:01.573  -->  00:02:03.653
and so this is an icon.
44

44

00:02:06.360  -->  00:02:11.360
And then use + href and then you know images,
45

45

00:02:12.920  -->  00:02:17.920
it's the icons.svg, from which we select icon CW.
46

46

00:02:21.650  -->  00:02:23.110
And that's it.
47

47

00:02:23.110  -->  00:02:24.680
So how does this actually work?
48

48

00:02:24.680  -->  00:02:28.140
So let's take a look at our CSS file here,
49

49

00:02:28.140  -->  00:02:31.290
so that's the CSS file, let's search for loader,
50

50

00:02:31.290  -->  00:02:32.750
and here we have it.
51

51

00:02:32.750  -->  00:02:35.290
So we style the loader here with this height,
52

52

00:02:35.290  -->  00:02:38.750
this width, and this fill, but the magic really happens here
53

53

00:02:38.750  -->  00:02:40.790
which is this animation, which is
54

54

00:02:40.790  -->  00:02:42.850
an infinite rotating animation.
55

55

00:02:42.850  -->  00:02:44.740
So that's the animation that I defined here
56

56

00:02:44.740  -->  00:02:46.470
with the key frames after all.
57

57

00:02:46.470  -->  00:02:48.270
I'm not sure you're familiar with that,
58

58

00:02:48.270  -->  00:02:50.772
but anyway, we have this animation here
59

59

00:02:50.772  -->  00:02:55.740
which basically makes this icon rotate 360 degrees.
60

60

00:02:55.740  -->  00:02:58.080
Then we stated that we want it to be infinite,
61

61

00:02:58.080  -->  00:03:00.160
and so basically as long as the element is
62

62

00:03:00.160  -->  00:03:03.230
on the page, it will keep rotating, okay.
63

63

00:03:03.230  -->  00:03:04.830
And that's as simple as it gets.
64

64

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:08.650
So really simple stuff here, that's all we need
65

65

00:03:08.650  -->  00:03:10.800
to do here in the situation.
66

66

00:03:10.800  -->  00:03:12.840
Now where do we actually attach it to?
67

67

00:03:12.840  -->  00:03:15.350
Well, that's the parent that we pass in.
68

68

00:03:15.350  -->  00:03:18.057
So, parent, and then, again we use or insert
69

69

00:03:18.057  -->  00:03:20.360
adjacent HTML.
70

70

00:03:20.360  -->  00:03:22.923
Let's take a look again at the documentation here.
71

71

00:03:24.500  -->  00:03:26.780
And so this time around we're gonna put it
72

72

00:03:26.780  -->  00:03:30.465
right after begin here, so right at the beginning
73

73

00:03:30.465  -->  00:03:33.386
of the parent element, so let's copy this
74

74

00:03:33.386  -->  00:03:38.386
function here, I'm not going to write it out myself.
75

75

00:03:41.100  -->  00:03:45.593
So afterbegin, and we want to attach actually is the loader.
76

76

00:03:48.440  -->  00:03:51.530
All right, and that is it, I guess.
77

77

00:03:51.530  -->  00:03:56.170
So, moving over to our index.js file over here,
78

78

00:03:56.170  -->  00:03:58.995
we now need to edit here, prepare UI for results.
79

79

00:03:58.995  -->  00:04:01.310
So the first thing that we want to do,
80

80

00:04:01.310  -->  00:04:03.520
we're actually, not so, after clearing the results
81

81

00:04:03.520  -->  00:04:07.200
from the search view, we now want to render our loader.
82

82

00:04:07.200  -->  00:04:10.110
So let's say, and actually we have to import it still.
83

83

00:04:10.110  -->  00:04:13.630
So this here, inside of this base file, right,
84

84

00:04:13.630  -->  00:04:17.660
and so, let's actually add the renderloader.
85

85

00:04:17.660  -->  00:04:19.573
So these are all named exports.
86

86

00:04:21.283  -->  00:04:23.000
And we could actually have done it
87

87

00:04:24.101  -->  00:04:25.090
with the asterisk import here.
88

88

00:04:25.090  -->  00:04:26.330
So basically, importing everything
89

89

00:04:26.330  -->  00:04:28.700
at the same time, but I'm keeping it like this
90

90

00:04:28.700  -->  00:04:30.350
because later we are actually going
91

91

00:04:30.350  -->  00:04:32.250
to add some stuff here that we're maybe
92

92

00:04:32.250  -->  00:04:35.080
not going to use here, so we don't have
93

93

00:04:35.080  -->  00:04:37.803
to expose it to this index.js file.
94

94

00:04:38.640  -->  00:04:42.023
Anyway, we can now use renderloader here,
95

95

00:04:44.239  -->  00:04:46.690
and all we have to do now is to pass in the parent element.
96

96

00:04:46.690  -->  00:04:49.430
And the parent element, where we want this to be
97

97

00:04:49.430  -->  00:04:52.720
is actually this, results, because the results
98

98

00:04:52.720  -->  00:04:54.690
list is an unordered list, we don't want
99

99

00:04:54.690  -->  00:04:58.290
the div inside of that, so this is only for LI elements.
100

100

00:04:58.290  -->  00:05:01.070
And so let's actually attach it here in this div
101

101

00:05:01.070  -->  00:05:05.267
so it is called results, and we need to then edit
102

102

00:05:05.267  -->  00:05:09.758
here into of course, into this element.
103

103

00:05:09.758  -->  00:05:14.758
So search document.queryselector,
104

104

00:05:21.330  -->  00:05:22.510
okay.
105

105

00:05:22.510  -->  00:05:23.863
Let's copy out this one.
106

106

00:05:26.350  -->  00:05:28.087
So elements.searchres.
107

107

00:05:29.600  -->  00:05:31.063
So this renders the loader.
108

108

00:05:32.500  -->  00:05:34.670
Okay, close this one up,
109

109

00:05:34.670  -->  00:05:35.820
and let's check it out.
110

110

00:05:37.600  -->  00:05:40.230
And here we go, so here it is.
111

111

00:05:40.230  -->  00:05:42.869
And it keeps rotating and rotating and rotating,
112

112

00:05:42.869  -->  00:05:45.260
waiting for the data to come back,
113

113

00:05:45.260  -->  00:05:47.650
and here we go, so here is our data,
114

114

00:05:47.650  -->  00:05:50.270
but the spinner is of course, still rotating here.
115

115

00:05:50.270  -->  00:05:54.160
So that's not ideal, and so let's get actually rid of it.
116

116

00:05:54.160  -->  00:05:57.437
Okay, but let me just inspect it here for you to see it.
117

117

00:05:57.437  -->  00:06:00.760
So that's the icon that we included
118

118

00:06:00.760  -->  00:06:02.537
and with the, sorry, with the
119

119

00:06:02.537  -->  00:06:06.451
infinite rotating animation here.
120

120

00:06:06.451  -->  00:06:08.820
So that's our spinner.
121

121

00:06:08.820  -->  00:06:12.769
Now we also need a method to get rid of it, right?
122

122

00:06:12.769  -->  00:06:16.170
So let's get back to our base.js
123

123

00:06:16.170  -->  00:06:18.383
and create the clear loader.
124

124

00:06:21.762  -->  00:06:24.410
And this time around we don't need to specify
125

125

00:06:24.410  -->  00:06:29.090
the parent, all we need to do is to select the loader.
126

126

00:06:29.090  -->  00:06:31.140
Now right now we cannot really select it
127

127

00:06:31.140  -->  00:06:33.210
like we did here in the elements,
128

128

00:06:33.210  -->  00:06:35.700
and that's because by the time that this code runs
129

129

00:06:35.700  -->  00:06:38.470
the loader is actually not yet on the page.
130

130

00:06:38.470  -->  00:06:42.083
And so we cannot select anything that is not yet there.
131

131

00:06:42.083  -->  00:06:43.840
So what we need to do here is to do
132

132

00:06:43.840  -->  00:06:46.710
the document.queryselector right here.
133

133

00:06:46.710  -->  00:06:51.710
So const + loader + document.queryselector,
134

134

00:06:54.860  -->  00:06:56.060
and then the class.
135

135

00:06:56.060  -->  00:06:59.032
Now it really bothers me to hard code this class
136

136

00:06:59.032  -->  00:07:02.460
into this query selector here now.
137

137

00:07:02.460  -->  00:07:04.630
I really want all of these classes like
138

138

00:07:04.630  -->  00:07:07.810
to be in a central place, so just like we did here.
139

139

00:07:07.810  -->  00:07:10.460
So this is a lot cleaner and in order
140

140

00:07:10.460  -->  00:07:13.120
to achieve the same thing, we will actually create
141

141

00:07:13.120  -->  00:07:17.523
a new object like this, elementstrings this time around.
142

142

00:07:25.259  -->  00:07:27.250
So we're gonna call this one loader,
143

143

00:07:27.250  -->  00:07:29.510
and it has the class name also loader,
144

144

00:07:29.510  -->  00:07:30.563
as we already know.
145

145

00:07:31.811  -->  00:07:36.811
Okay, so down here we now can say elementstrings.loader
146

146

00:07:40.480  -->  00:07:42.623
and the same thing actually up here.
147

147

00:07:48.870  -->  00:07:51.080
So if you were ever to change now the loader name
148

148

00:07:51.080  -->  00:07:53.080
in the CSS for some reason, then all we have
149

149

00:07:53.080  -->  00:07:56.010
to do would be to come here to this element,
150

150

00:07:56.010  -->  00:07:58.780
change it here, and then it would work automatically
151

151

00:07:58.780  -->  00:08:00.780
here in both of these methods,
152

152

00:08:00.780  -->  00:08:03.840
instead of being hard coded down here
153

153

00:08:03.840  -->  00:08:06.690
and also here in the render method.
154

154

00:08:06.690  -->  00:08:08.460
So maybe you think that's a bit overkill,
155

155

00:08:08.460  -->  00:08:10.010
that's not really necessary, but I like
156

156

00:08:10.010  -->  00:08:12.920
to keep things like that because I'm always looking
157

157

00:08:14.024  -->  00:08:15.270
for usability and maintainability,
158

158

00:08:15.270  -->  00:08:17.530
because that's something really important in all coding,
159

159

00:08:17.530  -->  00:08:19.780
not just Javascript, but also CSS
160

160

00:08:19.780  -->  00:08:23.690
and whatever really you're writing, okay.
161

161

00:08:23.690  -->  00:08:26.796
So in here we now selected the loader element,
162

162

00:08:26.796  -->  00:08:30.901
now let's test if it exists so we can then delete it.
163

163

00:08:30.901  -->  00:08:34.130
Okay, and actually this here is not ready yet,
164

164

00:08:34.130  -->  00:08:36.133
because we still need to add the dot.
165

165

00:08:37.080  -->  00:08:40.010
So let's do that using a template string,
166

166

00:08:40.010  -->  00:08:43.233
so dot and then this part.
167

167

00:08:48.100  -->  00:08:50.810
All right, and we cannot add the dot in here
168

168

00:08:50.810  -->  00:08:52.690
because then the dot would also be here
169

169

00:08:52.690  -->  00:08:54.952
in the class name, and we don't want that.
170

170

00:08:54.952  -->  00:08:56.513
So this really has to be just the class name,
171

171

00:08:58.532  -->  00:09:00.771
and then we add the dot here for the class selector
172

172

00:09:00.771  -->  00:09:02.570
here in the, right in the query selector.
173

173

00:09:02.570  -->  00:09:05.630
Anyway, if there is a loader, then you'd want to delete it.
174

174

00:09:05.630  -->  00:09:08.384
And maybe remember from the (mumbles) app,
175

175

00:09:08.384  -->  00:09:11.140
that deleting an element from the dom is a bit strange,
176

176

00:09:11.140  -->  00:09:14.603
so we have to go up to the parentelement,
177

177

00:09:15.950  -->  00:09:18.040
so parentelement, and then basically
178

178

00:09:18.040  -->  00:09:21.480
we move down again and remove the child.
179

179

00:09:21.480  -->  00:09:23.650
Okay, so in order to remove an element,
180

180

00:09:23.650  -->  00:09:25.170
we always have to remove the child,
181

181

00:09:25.170  -->  00:09:28.070
and in order to do that, we need to move up to the parent.
182

182

00:09:29.410  -->  00:09:32.570
Okay, and so, we pass in the loader again,
183

183

00:09:32.570  -->  00:09:36.381
which is our element, and that should be it.
184

184

00:09:36.381  -->  00:09:41.020
Okay, so what we want to do here is when we render
185

185

00:09:41.020  -->  00:09:43.450
the results, we first want to start
186

186

00:09:43.450  -->  00:09:46.674
by removing the loader, okay?
187

187

00:09:46.674  -->  00:09:51.674
And again we need to actually ascertain here.
188

188

00:09:52.700  -->  00:09:56.375
Or import it, so we want to render and we want to clear
189

189

00:09:56.375  -->  00:09:58.370
the loader, so all these methods
190

190

00:09:58.370  -->  00:09:59.852
we want it to be available here,
191

191

00:09:59.852  -->  00:10:04.852
and so let's say clear the loader,
192

192

00:10:07.160  -->  00:10:09.323
and that should do the job.
193

193

00:10:10.410  -->  00:10:12.480
So it already reloaded, let's search
194

194

00:10:12.480  -->  00:10:15.566
for pizza again, whoa, what's that.
195

195

00:10:15.566  -->  00:10:18.060
Well something's wrong here.
196

196

00:10:18.060  -->  00:10:19.890
I mean it did functionality, so it added the loader
197

197

00:10:19.890  -->  00:10:23.100
and it then it removed it, but I guess something
198

198

00:10:23.100  -->  00:10:25.710
is wrong with the class names.
199

199

00:10:25.710  -->  00:10:27.630
So yeah, of course it's not elements,
200

200

00:10:27.630  -->  00:10:29.373
it's elementstrings,
201

201

00:10:30.430  -->  00:10:33.800
so here and down here, it should be elementstrings,
202

202

00:10:33.800  -->  00:10:35.766
give it a save, let's try it again.
203

203

00:10:35.766  -->  00:10:39.380
And yeah, here we go, so it rotates
204

204

00:10:39.380  -->  00:10:41.900
and it disappears as soon as the results come back.
205

205

00:10:41.900  -->  00:10:45.080
So that's exactly the look that we were for.
206

206

00:10:45.080  -->  00:10:48.760
Okay, now next up we have to implement the pagination.
207

207

00:10:48.760  -->  00:10:51.472
So right now we have all these 30 results,
208

208

00:10:51.472  -->  00:10:54.600
all on the same page, and that's not really helpful
209

209

00:10:54.600  -->  00:10:57.370
because it makes the page way too long.
210

210

00:10:57.370  -->  00:10:59.870
And so what we want to do is to have three pages
211

211

00:10:59.870  -->  00:11:03.130
with 10 results on each, and so,
212

212

00:11:03.130  -->  00:11:05.140
in the next lecture, that's what we're gonna
213

213

00:11:05.140  -->  00:11:06.853
take care of, so see you then.
