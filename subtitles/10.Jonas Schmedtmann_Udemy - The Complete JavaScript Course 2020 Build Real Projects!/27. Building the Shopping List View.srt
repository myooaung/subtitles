1

00:00:01,367  -->  00:00:02,490
<v Instructor>So let's now build</v>
2

2

00:00:02,490  -->  00:00:05,640
a very simple, shopping list view.
3

3

00:00:05,640  -->  00:00:06,639
And as always,
4

4

00:00:06,639  -->  00:00:09,472
we start by creating the new file,
5

5

00:00:12,775  -->  00:00:15,108
then let's get our elements,
6

6

00:00:16,023  -->  00:00:18,523
simply by copying it from here
7

7

00:00:21,028  -->  00:00:22,432
and okay
8

8

00:00:22,432  -->  00:00:23,458
So we're only gonna have
9

9

00:00:23,458  -->  00:00:24,996
two small methods in here,
10

10

00:00:24,996  -->  00:00:27,449
one to render the item and in one to
11

11

00:00:27,449  -->  00:00:29,511
delete the item from the user interface.
12

12

00:00:29,511  -->  00:00:33,261
Okay, so very simple stuff here in this view.
13

13

00:00:35,569  -->  00:00:38,819
So the first one is to render the item,
14

14

00:00:40,843  -->  00:00:42,432
and in order to do that,
15

15

00:00:42,432  -->  00:00:45,259
we will simply receive the item as an input,
16

16

00:00:45,259  -->  00:00:49,176
and the other function will be delete the item,
17

17

00:00:53,847  -->  00:00:56,668
for which we need an ID,
18

18

00:00:56,668  -->  00:00:59,897
so in a similar way to the list model.
19

19

00:00:59,897  -->  00:01:00,967
Okay, so based on an ID
20

20

00:01:00,967  -->  00:01:03,469
we can delete the item
21

21

00:01:03,469  -->  00:01:04,426
and in order to render it
22

22

00:01:04,426  -->  00:01:06,778
we need to have the item object itself.
23

23

00:01:06,778  -->  00:01:08,788
So let's start with this one here,
24

24

00:01:08,788  -->  00:01:12,121
create a marker variable such as before,
25

25

00:01:18,014  -->  00:01:19,533
and so let's get that marker
26

26

00:01:19,533  -->  00:01:21,533
here from our HTML file.
27

27

00:01:23,700  -->  00:01:25,884
So where is that, so here we have
28

28

00:01:25,884  -->  00:01:27,629
the UL, which contains the
29

29

00:01:27,629  -->  00:01:29,249
shopping list items.
30

30

00:01:29,249  -->  00:01:30,632
So all of these items are inside
31

31

00:01:30,632  -->  00:01:32,327
the shopping list element.
32

32

00:01:32,327  -->  00:01:34,744
Okay, so let's copy this one,
33

33

00:01:39,156  -->  00:01:40,263
alright. And since we're at it
34

34

00:01:40,263  -->  00:01:42,127
we can also create the
35

35

00:01:42,127  -->  00:01:44,752
shopping list here in our dumb element,
36

36

00:01:44,752  -->  00:01:46,585
and it is in the base,
37

37

00:01:49,801  -->  00:01:50,830
so shopping will be
38

38

00:01:50,830  -->  00:01:52,747
document.query selector
39

39

00:01:55,939  -->  00:01:58,211
and then shopping list.
40

40

00:01:58,211  -->  00:02:00,478
Alright, so the first thing
41

41

00:02:00,478  -->  00:02:02,738
that we're gonna use is the ID.
42

42

00:02:02,738  -->  00:02:04,076
And so just like before let's
43

43

00:02:04,076  -->  00:02:06,883
add a data attribute here.
44

44

00:02:06,883  -->  00:02:08,966
So data item ID should be
45

45

00:02:10,293  -->  00:02:11,710
equal to item.ID.
46

46

00:02:13,559  -->  00:02:15,070
So the one that we passed in here
47

47

00:02:15,070  -->  00:02:17,111
with the list item.
48

48

00:02:17,111  -->  00:02:19,369
Okay so this is the same way that we did before,
49

49

00:02:19,369  -->  00:02:21,431
so we specified a data attribute here
50

50

00:02:21,431  -->  00:02:25,514
in this view such like we did here in the search view.
51

51

00:02:26,505  -->  00:02:28,367
Okay, and remember that one,
52

52

00:02:28,367  -->  00:02:32,417
so in here somewhere we should have, well,
53

53

00:02:32,417  -->  00:02:33,584
where is that?
54

54

00:02:35,711  -->  00:02:38,025
so uh ya it's here in the button.
55

55

00:02:38,025  -->  00:02:40,086
So here we have this data attribute
56

56

00:02:40,086  -->  00:02:42,146
which is data go to it, so we called
57

57

00:02:42,146  -->  00:02:43,875
go to to this one so we can later
58

58

00:02:43,875  -->  00:02:45,835
select the elements based on
59

59

00:02:45,835  -->  00:02:49,967
that data attribute and based on an ID in our case.
60

60

00:02:49,967  -->  00:02:51,568
Okay, So this will be useful
61

61

00:02:51,568  -->  00:02:53,896
in order to delete the item.
62

62

00:02:53,896  -->  00:02:55,742
So we have the ID attribute,
63

63

00:02:55,742  -->  00:02:58,503
let's now include the count,
64

64

00:02:58,503  -->  00:03:00,790
and the count is actually here in the value.
65

65

00:03:00,790  -->  00:03:02,367
Okay, so we have an input field,
66

66

00:03:02,367  -->  00:03:04,776
and that input field has a predefined value,
67

67

00:03:04,776  -->  00:03:08,218
and that value is what we want to specify here.
68

68

00:03:08,218  -->  00:03:10,385
And it will be item.count.
69

69

00:03:11,464  -->  00:03:15,260
Okay, and the same thing goes for the step.
70

70

00:03:15,260  -->  00:03:17,812
So the step is like the change that happens
71

71

00:03:17,812  -->  00:03:21,736
when we hit the arrow buttons on the number field.
72

72

00:03:21,736  -->  00:03:23,293
So let me show that to you,
73

73

00:03:23,293  -->  00:03:25,043
here in this example,
74

74

00:03:25,939  -->  00:03:27,406
So we have this list here,
75

75

00:03:27,406  -->  00:03:28,940
and you see that for example
76

76

00:03:28,940  -->  00:03:30,281
here we have 0.25,
77

77

00:03:30,281  -->  00:03:32,119
and when we hit the UP button,
78

78

00:03:32,119  -->  00:03:34,898
then it will increase by 025 to 0.5
79

79

00:03:34,898  -->  00:03:36,693
and then to 025,
80

80

00:03:36,693  -->  00:03:38,592
okay, and so we can define that step
81

81

00:03:38,592  -->  00:03:39,652
and if we do the same here
82

82

00:03:39,652  -->  00:03:43,076
then it will increase not to 1.25 but to two,
83

83

00:03:43,076  -->  00:03:44,501
three, and so on and so forth.
84

84

00:03:44,501  -->  00:03:46,399
And here for example it will increase to nine,
85

85

00:03:46,399  -->  00:03:49,533
then to 13, and so on and so forth.
86

86

00:03:49,533  -->  00:03:52,119
Okay so we define that we want the count
87

87

00:03:52,119  -->  00:03:53,292
also to be a step.
88

88

00:03:53,292  -->  00:03:54,997
Of course, if you want to manually change it by hand
89

89

00:03:54,997  -->  00:03:56,326
we can also write in.
90

90

00:03:56,326  -->  00:03:58,363
Okay so whenever we click these buttons here
91

91

00:03:58,363  -->  00:04:00,280
our value gets updated.
92

92

00:04:01,874  -->  00:04:03,995
So next up we have here,
93

93

00:04:03,995  -->  00:04:06,328
the, the unit, and of course
94

94

00:04:07,703  -->  00:04:11,786
so item.unit, and in here we have the ingredient.
95

95

00:04:15,446  -->  00:04:18,766
Okay, and finally we also want to add a class here
96

96

00:04:18,766  -->  00:04:22,402
so that we can later select this input
97

97

00:04:22,402  -->  00:04:24,781
so that we can then read this
98

98

00:04:24,781  -->  00:04:27,000
value here to update it in our model.
99

99

00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:29,424
Right? So when we want to do this updating
100

100

00:04:29,424  -->  00:04:31,152
here we need the new count, and that
101

101

00:04:31,152  -->  00:04:32,294
new count is, or course,
102

102

00:04:32,294  -->  00:04:35,080
gonna come through this input field.
103

103

00:04:35,080  -->  00:04:37,230
Okay, and so we want to read the value,
104

104

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:38,457
and so in order to do that let's
105

105

00:04:38,457  -->  00:04:42,152
edit class here so we can then easily read it out
106

106

00:04:42,152  -->  00:04:44,047
so this is going to be called
107

107

00:04:44,047  -->  00:04:46,047
uh shopping count value.
108

108

00:04:48,459  -->  00:04:49,539
So very simple.
109

109

00:04:49,539  -->  00:04:51,386
Okay now all we have to do is to
110

110

00:04:51,386  -->  00:04:54,969
insert this marker to our elements.shopping
111

111

00:04:58,368  -->  00:05:00,068
adjacent HTML,
112

112

00:05:00,068  -->  00:05:03,815
and we will do this here at before end.
113

113

00:05:03,815  -->  00:05:07,398
Okay, so that one is added after the other.
114

114

00:05:10,048  -->  00:05:11,751
Okay, so if we already have two items
115

115

00:05:11,751  -->  00:05:13,748
there then we want the third one to be
116

116

00:05:13,748  -->  00:05:15,998
after the first two, right?
117

117

00:05:17,554  -->  00:05:18,976
Okay, so that one is now done,
118

118

00:05:18,976  -->  00:05:20,712
let's move on to the next one.
119

119

00:05:20,712  -->  00:05:22,282
And so let's now actually already
120

120

00:05:22,282  -->  00:05:24,299
use this data item ID
121

121

00:05:24,299  -->  00:05:25,706
property that we have here,
122

122

00:05:25,706  -->  00:05:26,888
because in order to delete
123

123

00:05:26,888  -->  00:05:28,775
item function all we pass in is the ID.
124

124

00:05:28,775  -->  00:05:30,322
And so now we have to select
125

125

00:05:30,322  -->  00:05:31,516
the element that we want to delete,
126

126

00:05:31,516  -->  00:05:32,933
based on that ID.
127

127

00:05:36,473  -->  00:05:39,425
So documented query selector,
128

128

00:05:39,425  -->  00:05:42,426
and now we can use this CSS attribute selector,
129

129

00:05:42,426  -->  00:05:45,530
which is simply using these brackets.
130

130

00:05:45,530  -->  00:05:47,462
So we wanna select based on data,
131

131

00:05:47,462  -->  00:05:51,621
item ID which should be equal to, and now we want
132

132

00:05:51,621  -->  00:05:55,237
the quotes, and then we pass in the ID, and that's it.
133

133

00:05:55,237  -->  00:05:58,070
And so now when we pass in the ID,
134

134

00:06:01,208  -->  00:06:03,347
we will be able to select the exact element,
135

135

00:06:03,347  -->  00:06:06,493
because here we basically attached that ID
136

136

00:06:06,493  -->  00:06:09,196
to our element here, okay
137

137

00:06:09,196  -->  00:06:10,638
and so the goal was of course,
138

138

00:06:10,638  -->  00:06:12,806
to be able to do exactly this.
139

139

00:06:12,806  -->  00:06:14,429
Okay, and so now remember
140

140

00:06:14,429  -->  00:06:16,295
how we actually remove stuff
141

141

00:06:16,295  -->  00:06:18,357
from the user interface,
142

142

00:06:18,357  -->  00:06:20,183
we have to move up to the parent,
143

143

00:06:20,183  -->  00:06:23,045
so that we can then remove the child.
144

144

00:06:23,045  -->  00:06:26,661
So remove child, and then item again,
145

145

00:06:26,661  -->  00:06:27,494
and that's it.
146

146

00:06:27,494  -->  00:06:29,676
So right now we cannot really test this,
147

147

00:06:29,676  -->  00:06:31,730
because you don't have all your control yet,
148

148

00:06:31,730  -->  00:06:33,243
I mean we could but it's not really necessary
149

149

00:06:33,243  -->  00:06:36,042
so we're just gonna move in to the controller
150

150

00:06:36,042  -->  00:06:37,478
right now in the next video,
151

151

00:06:37,478  -->  00:06:38,946
and then we're gonna be able to see
152

152

00:06:38,946  -->  00:06:40,187
if all of this works,
153

153

00:06:40,187  -->  00:06:41,050
Okay, so see you there
154

154

00:06:41,050  -->  00:06:42,050
in a second.
