00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:02,180
<v ->All right.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,180  -->  00:00:04,670
Now before we do anything else in this section,
3

3

00:00:04,670  -->  00:00:07,110
let's take a look at the project that we're gonna build,
4

4

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:09,283
to get you really excited, okay?
5

5

00:00:10,150  -->  00:00:11,450
And so here it is.
6

6

00:00:11,450  -->  00:00:13,130
This is the project that we're gonna build
7

7

00:00:13,130  -->  00:00:14,680
throughout this section.
8

8

00:00:14,680  -->  00:00:16,970
And it's a small app called Forkify.
9

9

00:00:16,970  -->  00:00:20,100
And it is a very simple recipe searching app.
10

10

00:00:20,100  -->  00:00:23,710
So in here it says, search over one million recipes.
11

11

00:00:23,710  -->  00:00:27,050
And these recipes, they actually come from a real API
12

12

00:00:27,050  -->  00:00:28,860
that I selected for this project.
13

13

00:00:28,860  -->  00:00:31,230
And so, of course, we're gonna do all that cool stuff,
14

14

00:00:31,230  -->  00:00:35,080
like the asynchronus, JavaScript, and Ajax, and API's,
15

15

00:00:35,080  -->  00:00:37,960
all of that that we talked in the last section.
16

16

00:00:37,960  -->  00:00:40,870
So to try it, let's search for something like pizza,
17

17

00:00:40,870  -->  00:00:43,860
because everyone loves pizza, right?
18

18

00:00:43,860  -->  00:00:46,310
And so now it's fetching these data here
19

19

00:00:46,310  -->  00:00:49,450
from a real world API, again, as I mentioned.
20

20

00:00:49,450  -->  00:00:52,392
And so we have then 30 search results.
21

21

00:00:52,392  -->  00:00:55,220
And we have this pagination here.
22

22

00:00:55,220  -->  00:00:58,530
So we hit page two, one, three,
23

23

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:01,620
and then we can scroll through these different results.
24

24

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:03,690
And of course, we can select one of these recipes,
25

25

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:06,800
and again, it then loads it from the external API.
26

26

00:01:06,800  -->  00:01:08,330
And as soon as it loads the recipe,
27

27

00:01:08,330  -->  00:01:12,350
it stops that spinner, and then displays the recipe, okay?
28

28

00:01:12,350  -->  00:01:15,060
So we have an image, then we have here the ingredients,
29

29

00:01:15,060  -->  00:01:17,040
and we can also adjust the number of servings.
30

30

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:18,467
So we can hit these buttons,
31

31

00:01:18,467  -->  00:01:20,940
and you see that the amount of ingredients
32

32

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:22,770
then automatically adjusts.
33

33

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:25,070
So we can move up and down,
34

34

00:01:25,070  -->  00:01:28,040
and let's say we want this one to be for six people.
35

35

00:01:28,040  -->  00:01:31,640
We can then also add these ingredients to a shopping list,
36

36

00:01:31,640  -->  00:01:35,280
like this, which then appears here on the right side.
37

37

00:01:35,280  -->  00:01:36,900
So, cool, right?
38

38

00:01:36,900  -->  00:01:40,000
We can then also adjust these numbers here, like this,
39

39

00:01:40,000  -->  00:01:42,310
or we can, of course, delete some ingredients,
40

40

00:01:42,310  -->  00:01:45,023
if we already have them at home, right?
41

41

00:01:47,000  -->  00:01:48,070
What's more?
42

42

00:01:48,070  -->  00:01:50,740
Well down here is a button where we can then click,
43

43

00:01:50,740  -->  00:01:52,720
which takes us to the website,
44

44

00:01:52,720  -->  00:01:57,580
where the instructions for the recipe actually are, okay?
45

45

00:01:57,580  -->  00:02:00,250
And then, finally, another cool feature
46

46

00:02:00,250  -->  00:02:03,460
is that we can save these recipes in our favorites.
47

47

00:02:03,460  -->  00:02:05,230
So we hit this like button here,
48

48

00:02:05,230  -->  00:02:07,550
and then you'll see, up here, we now have this list
49

49

00:02:07,550  -->  00:02:10,100
of our liked recipes.
50

50

00:02:10,100  -->  00:02:11,920
So let's now try another one.
51

51

00:02:11,920  -->  00:02:14,730
Let's open this one here, let's say.
52

52

00:02:14,730  -->  00:02:18,090
And we can now also add these to the list, for example.
53

53

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:19,500
And you see that
54

54

00:02:19,500  -->  00:02:21,290
then we have the three down here now as well.
55

55

00:02:21,290  -->  00:02:23,890
And we can, of course, also like it.
56

56

00:02:23,890  -->  00:02:26,210
And so now you see that we have two here.
57

57

00:02:26,210  -->  00:02:27,760
And let's try with another one.
58

58

00:02:28,750  -->  00:02:30,650
Let's add this one as well.
59

59

00:02:30,650  -->  00:02:33,570
And so now we have these three here in the list.
60

60

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:35,700
And the coolest part is that this actually works
61

61

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:37,350
even after reloading the page,
62

62

00:02:37,350  -->  00:02:39,950
or let's say that we open this again.
63

63

00:02:39,950  -->  00:02:41,050
So let's copy the url,
64

64

00:02:43,740  -->  00:02:45,710
open it to a new tab, close the old one,
65

65

00:02:45,710  -->  00:02:48,390
and you see that the likes, they are still here.
66

66

00:02:48,390  -->  00:02:51,020
And so this is by using something called local storage,
67

67

00:02:51,020  -->  00:02:52,900
which is a cool JavaScript API
68

68

00:02:52,900  -->  00:02:54,799
that we're gonna learn a bit later.
69

69

00:02:54,799  -->  00:02:58,630
And so, yeah, I think that's the main parts,
70

70

00:02:58,630  -->  00:03:00,640
the main features of this app.
71

71

00:03:00,640  -->  00:03:02,290
And I really hope that you love it,
72

72

00:03:02,290  -->  00:03:05,060
because, once again, I tried to make it a
73

73

00:03:05,060  -->  00:03:07,150
real beautiful and real world app,
74

74

00:03:07,150  -->  00:03:10,460
so that you're really proud after coding this app,
75

75

00:03:10,460  -->  00:03:12,250
after all these lectures.
76

76

00:03:12,250  -->  00:03:13,380
So, that is the app,
77

77

00:03:13,380  -->  00:03:16,010
and I already opened the starter code
78

78

00:03:16,010  -->  00:03:18,010
that I hope that you downloaded already.
79

79

00:03:18,010  -->  00:03:20,590
So I opted here in VS code,
80

80

00:03:20,590  -->  00:03:24,710
by hitting here this open command, okay?
81

81

00:03:24,710  -->  00:03:28,490
And so we simply have two folders in this starter file.
82

82

00:03:28,490  -->  00:03:31,280
It's the source folder and the distribution folder.
83

83

00:03:31,280  -->  00:03:33,890
And in the source folder is where, of course,
84

84

00:03:33,890  -->  00:03:35,840
the source code will go,
85

85

00:03:35,840  -->  00:03:39,640
so our JavaScript code, and the index dot html file.
86

86

00:03:39,640  -->  00:03:41,840
So, our markup here.
87

87

00:03:41,840  -->  00:03:43,700
And then, in the distribution folder here,
88

88

00:03:43,700  -->  00:03:45,700
is where the final files go,
89

89

00:03:45,700  -->  00:03:49,800
ready to be deployed and ready to be served to the client.
90

90

00:03:49,800  -->  00:03:51,390
So, of course, we're gonna go a bit deeper
91

91

00:03:51,390  -->  00:03:52,850
into all of this a bit later,
92

92

00:03:52,850  -->  00:03:55,770
but for now, just know that the final CSS files here,
93

93

00:03:55,770  -->  00:03:57,130
as well as the image,
94

94

00:03:57,130  -->  00:04:00,180
and our compiled JavaScript file will also be here.
95

95

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:02,280
But again, a bit more on that later.
96

96

00:04:02,280  -->  00:04:04,950
You can also see the CSS file here.
97

97

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:07,450
And if you're interested in the styling of the app,
98

98

00:04:07,450  -->  00:04:09,860
then, of course, you can dive deep into this file
99

99

00:04:09,860  -->  00:04:13,707
and see all the CSS code that I wrote just for this app.
100

100

00:04:13,707  -->  00:04:15,760
And you see that I actually used some
101

101

00:04:15,760  -->  00:04:18,240
pretty advanced and modern CSS techniques,
102

102

00:04:18,240  -->  00:04:22,710
like CSS grips here, and a lot of flexbox as well.
103

103

00:04:22,710  -->  00:04:25,440
So this is a really a cutting-edge CSS as well.
104

104

00:04:25,440  -->  00:04:26,720
So if you're interested in that,
105

105

00:04:26,720  -->  00:04:28,540
then please take a look.
106

106

00:04:28,540  -->  00:04:32,490
It's for free (laughs), also included in this project, okay?
107

107

00:04:32,490  -->  00:04:34,700
And so that's it for this video.
108

108

00:04:34,700  -->  00:04:37,640
Next up, we're gonna talk a bit about modern JavaScript,
109

109

00:04:37,640  -->  00:04:39,710
and the development setup that we're gonna use
110

110

00:04:39,710  -->  00:04:42,033
to build this beautiful and real world app.
