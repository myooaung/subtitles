00:00:01,886  -->  00:00:04,023
<v Jonas>So after learning all about conditionals</v>
2

2

00:00:04,023  -->  00:00:06,403
and true false values in JavaScript
3

3

00:00:06,403  -->  00:00:09,596
it's now time for another coding challenge.
4

4

00:00:09,596  -->  00:00:12,202
So let's say John and Mike both play basketball
5

5

00:00:12,202  -->  00:00:13,805
but on different teams.
6

6

00:00:13,805  -->  00:00:15,221
And in the latest three games,
7

7

00:00:15,221  -->  00:00:19,064
John's team has scored 89, 120 and 103 points.
8

8

00:00:19,064  -->  00:00:23,731
And Mike's team has scored 116, 94 and 123 points, okay.
9

9

00:00:24,567  -->  00:00:26,744
What I want you to do, is calculate the average
10

10

00:00:26,744  -->  00:00:29,275
score for each team, then decide
11

11

00:00:29,275  -->  00:00:32,485
which team wins on average, so the one that has
12

12

00:00:32,485  -->  00:00:34,354
the highest average score and then
13

13

00:00:34,354  -->  00:00:36,914
print the winner to the console.
14

14

00:00:36,914  -->  00:00:39,300
And when you print that winner to the console
15

15

00:00:39,300  -->  00:00:41,465
then also include the average score.
16

16

00:00:41,465  -->  00:00:44,426
Okay, so we already calculated averages before,
17

17

00:00:44,426  -->  00:00:46,858
so all we have to do is add up the values
18

18

00:00:46,858  -->  00:00:49,244
and then divide by three in this case,
19

19

00:00:49,244  -->  00:00:51,537
because we have three results here, okay.
20

20

00:00:51,537  -->  00:00:53,156
And then what I also wanted to do,
21

21

00:00:53,156  -->  00:00:56,715
is to change scores in order to show different winners.
22

22

00:00:56,715  -->  00:00:59,124
And so here, don't forget to take into account,
23

23

00:00:59,124  -->  00:01:01,359
that there might be a draw.
24

24

00:01:01,359  -->  00:01:04,644
So it means that there is the same average score.
25

25

00:01:04,644  -->  00:01:06,461
And so in your fl statement, you will
26

26

00:01:06,461  -->  00:01:08,656
have to keep that in mind, okay?
27

27

00:01:08,656  -->  00:01:11,808
Now after you finish that, you can take it to the next level
28

28

00:01:11,808  -->  00:01:13,625
and add a little extra.
29

29

00:01:13,625  -->  00:01:16,399
And in this case, Mary also plays basketball
30

30

00:01:16,399  -->  00:01:20,316
and her team has scored 97, 134 and 105 points.
31

31

00:01:21,937  -->  00:01:24,277
And like before, I want you to log the average
32

32

00:01:24,277  -->  00:01:25,955
winner to the consule.
33

33

00:01:25,955  -->  00:01:27,417
So what you're gonna have to do here,
34

34

00:01:27,417  -->  00:01:29,188
is check if one of the players
35

35

00:01:29,188  -->  00:01:31,754
has a larger score than the other two.
36

36

00:01:31,754  -->  00:01:33,315
Okay, in order to do that you,
37

37

00:01:33,315  -->  00:01:35,399
you will probably need the end operator
38

38

00:01:35,399  -->  00:01:37,454
to take that decision.
39

39

00:01:37,454  -->  00:01:39,225
Okay, and if you can not solve this one
40

40

00:01:39,225  -->  00:01:41,605
then it's absolutely no problem.
41

41

00:01:41,605  -->  00:01:43,642
You can just watch the solution
42

42

00:01:43,642  -->  00:01:45,982
and see how I do it in there.
43

43

00:01:45,982  -->  00:01:48,217
Okay, the most important thing is that
44

44

00:01:48,217  -->  00:01:50,986
you can do these number one two and three.
45

45

00:01:50,986  -->  00:01:53,348
Okay, and if you wanna take it to the next level
46

46

00:01:53,348  -->  00:01:55,363
here with the number four, then that's also
47

47

00:01:55,363  -->  00:01:57,499
a great addition to this challenge, okay.
48

48

00:01:57,499  -->  00:01:59,089
So take a couple of minutes here,
49

49

00:01:59,089  -->  00:02:01,586
maybe a half an hour, and try to really complete
50

50

00:02:01,586  -->  00:02:02,642
this challenge.
51

51

00:02:02,642  -->  00:02:07,309
And then I'll see you in the next video with a solution.
