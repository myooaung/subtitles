<v Instructor>In this lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02.462  -->  00:00:05.814
we're going to start with updating the income percentages,
3

3

00:00:05.814  -->  00:00:08.282
which is the main task for this step three
4

4

00:00:08.282  -->  00:00:09.532
of our project.
5

5

00:00:10.810  -->  00:00:13.503
And this will be more of a short lecture,
6

6

00:00:13.503  -->  00:00:16.572
and so we're just going to reinforce some of the concepts
7

7

00:00:16.572  -->  00:00:20.155
and techniques that we have learned so far.
8

8

00:00:21.468  -->  00:00:23.403
So here we are once again
9

9

00:00:23.403  -->  00:00:25.782
in our app controller.
10

10

00:00:25.782  -->  00:00:28.554
Now the question that we should ask is
11

11

00:00:28.554  -->  00:00:30.723
when will these income percentages
12

12

00:00:30.723  -->  00:00:33.364
actually be updated,
13

13

00:00:33.364  -->  00:00:35.870
and the answer is that these percentages
14

14

00:00:35.870  -->  00:00:39.628
are calculated and updated each time that we add
15

15

00:00:39.628  -->  00:00:41.398
or delete an item,
16

16

00:00:41.398  -->  00:00:43.948
because remember these percentages
17

17

00:00:43.948  -->  00:00:46.598
are the percentage of the income
18

18

00:00:46.598  -->  00:00:49.672
that each expense represents.
19

19

00:00:49.672  -->  00:00:51.391
So when we add a new income
20

20

00:00:51.391  -->  00:00:53.973
or when we delete an income from the list
21

21

00:00:53.973  -->  00:00:56.106
then all of these expense percentages
22

22

00:00:56.106  -->  00:00:58.638
will be updated, they will all change,
23

23

00:00:58.638  -->  00:01:01.262
and also when we add a new expense
24

24

00:01:01.262  -->  00:01:03.236
the percentage must be calculated
25

25

00:01:03.236  -->  00:01:05.987
and of course updated and displayed.
26

26

00:01:05.987  -->  00:01:10.049
So again when we add and when we delete an item,
27

27

00:01:10.049  -->  00:01:12.298
and this means that we should probably
28

28

00:01:12.298  -->  00:01:14.746
create a new separate function for this
29

29

00:01:14.746  -->  00:01:17.314
so that we can then call that function
30

30

00:01:17.314  -->  00:01:20.040
here in our control at item function
31

31

00:01:20.040  -->  00:01:23.074
or control delete item function.
32

32

00:01:23.074  -->  00:01:25.159
Okay so this is something very similar
33

33

00:01:25.159  -->  00:01:28.775
to the update budget function here, right.
34

34

00:01:28.775  -->  00:01:31.186
So we also created a function for that,
35

35

00:01:31.186  -->  00:01:32.795
a separate function here
36

36

00:01:32.795  -->  00:01:35.602
which is called update budget, and then called it
37

37

00:01:35.602  -->  00:01:39.227
in both of these control functions here, right.
38

38

00:01:39.227  -->  00:01:42.915
And so now we're going to do something similar
39

39

00:01:42.915  -->  00:01:44.369
and I'm going to call it
40

40

00:01:44.369  -->  00:01:46.619
update percentages, simply.
41

41

00:01:48.074  -->  00:01:51.074
Update percentages.
42

42

00:01:54.654  -->  00:01:57.429
And we don't need any arguments here,
43

43

00:01:57.429  -->  00:01:58.610
and that's it.
44

44

00:01:58.610  -->  00:02:00.395
All right and what are we going to do
45

45

00:02:00.395  -->  00:02:01.796
here in this function?
46

46

00:02:01.796  -->  00:02:03.459
And again it's very similar
47

47

00:02:03.459  -->  00:02:05.937
to the update budget function.
48

48

00:02:05.937  -->  00:02:09.770
So we first need to calculate the percentages.
49

49

00:02:12.459  -->  00:02:14.923
Then after that we're going to read them
50

50

00:02:14.923  -->  00:02:17.173
from the budget controller.
51

51

00:02:24.426  -->  00:02:26.971
So very similar again.
52

52

00:02:26.971  -->  00:02:28.231
And finally
53

53

00:02:28.231  -->  00:02:30.981
we then update the user interface
54

54

00:02:35.312  -->  00:02:37.628
with the new percentages,
55

55

00:02:37.628  -->  00:02:40.419
and we're going to do that such as we did before
56

56

00:02:40.419  -->  00:02:42.614
over the next two lectures.
57

57

00:02:42.614  -->  00:02:43.831
So in the next lecture
58

58

00:02:43.831  -->  00:02:46.542
we're going to take care of the budget controller
59

59

00:02:46.542  -->  00:02:48.664
and then code these two functions here
60

60

00:02:48.664  -->  00:02:51.270
to calculate and to get,
61

61

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:53.504
so similar to calculating
62

62

00:02:53.504  -->  00:02:55.874
the budget and then getting the budget
63

63

00:02:55.874  -->  00:02:59.081
and then finally we're going to code a method
64

64

00:02:59.081  -->  00:03:01.292
which will then display these percentages
65

65

00:03:01.292  -->  00:03:03.098
on the user interface,
66

66

00:03:03.098  -->  00:03:05.002
but for now all we need to do
67

67

00:03:05.002  -->  00:03:08.013
is to call this function here
68

68

00:03:08.013  -->  00:03:10.512
in our other two functions, right.
69

69

00:03:10.512  -->  00:03:13.559
So in here we have a step six,
70

70

00:03:13.559  -->  00:03:18.333
which is to calculate and update the percentages,
71

71

00:03:18.333  -->  00:03:22.166
and update percentages.
72

72

00:03:23.346  -->  00:03:27.074
And this one is called update percentages.
73

73

00:03:27.074  -->  00:03:29.222
So we call this function from here
74

74

00:03:29.222  -->  00:03:31.901
so that we don't have to write the exact same code
75

75

00:03:31.901  -->  00:03:34.602
down here in the function that handles
76

76

00:03:34.602  -->  00:03:36.602
the deleting of an item.
77

77

00:03:37.897  -->  00:03:40.568
Okay and calculate and update percentages,
78

78

00:03:40.568  -->  00:03:43.846
and in here it's just step number four.
79

79

00:03:43.846  -->  00:03:45.781
All right so in the next lecture
80

80

00:03:45.781  -->  00:03:49.160
we're going to take care of coding these two methods
81

81

00:03:49.160  -->  00:03:51.493
into our budget controller.
