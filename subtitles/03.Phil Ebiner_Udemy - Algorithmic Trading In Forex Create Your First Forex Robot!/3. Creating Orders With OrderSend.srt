00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,430
Hello this is Carol from Fargo dot com and welcome to the 15th tutorial on algorithmic trading in kill

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,630
four for complete beginners.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,210
And today's going to be a very exciting tutorial.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,190
We're actually going to send our very first order through and algorithmic trading system.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,950
Yep that's exactly it.

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,760
You heard it.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,270
We're sending our first order today.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,980
And that's jump straight into it.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:41,300
So in front of me I have the code which we created in a previous tutorial I'm just going to go quickly

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,990
and say it as tutorial 15.

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:53,660
So we have a new file save that compile as you can see it's compiling a works where you have all the

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,800
necessary information in here.

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,130
We're letting the trader in the take profit level which is set at default 10 Pip's Stop-Loss level also

14
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,550
set a default 10 Pip's.

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,430
But because this is an xterm variable the trader can change it.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,370
Once you launches the script on start function creates two new variables take profit level and stop

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,170
the stop loss level.

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,970
These two variables are calculated using the bid price through the take profit supplied by the trader

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,360
and the stop loss supplied by the charter.

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:36,200
As you remember point is just an indicator or basically a internal variable of the terminal which tells

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:44,130
us that the basically the amount of decimal points of the current symbol.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:53,090
And finally at the well we stopped on the last toile was we just printed out onto the trader's screen

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,280
the calculate levels Volstead we're going to take one more step further and we're actually going to

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,590
send an order and to send an order we have to use a function is called Order send function.

25
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,120
Don't get too concerned about the word function right now we're going to look at functions in the next

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,740
tutorial for knowledge.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,910
Just use it.

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,030
And as I like to say let's learn by doing.

29
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,260
Let's actually send the order and see how it all works.

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:28,880
And in the next tutorial will actually understand in more depth what functions are and how how to use

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
them properly.

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,500
So we're going to type in order send.

33
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,670
I hope you're following open a standard bracket.

34
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,850
And here we have a problem.

35
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:45,260
So are in these brackets we're going to have to supply a list of parameters.

36
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,790
So we're going to click f highlight or center and click one.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,450
This brings up this call for reference.

38
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,660
Here you will see the list of parameters we need to supply for this function and it's a symbol name

39
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,970
the command in our case we're going to send a buy order volume number of lottes price at which price

40
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,560
we want to buy or sell slippage.

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,040
Basically that's up by how much the price can deviate.

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,240
Stop Loss level take profit level and I comment if we want to and some other parameters we should.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,190
We're not going to worry about at this stage because we don't really need them.

44
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,170
They have default values.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,830
Once again we will study this in more detail in the next tutorial.

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,600
For now let's just write the function.

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:39,080
So once again we type in the symbol name for us is going to be your dollar command.

48
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,170
We want to buy and the command for buys you O.P. underscored by you so you can see the prompt came up

49
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,530
Colma volume.

50
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,470
We're going to buy one lot.

51
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,490
Price at which price do we buy orders.

52
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:58,220
If you look back a couple of tutorials you can recall that we buy order.

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,000
We buy currencies at the ask price which is the dear price slippage.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,410
We're going to send a set at ten pips Stop-Loss.

55
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,960
We already have the calculated Stop-Loss in here it's asking us not for the stop loss not for the amount

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,180
of Pip's but actually the Stop-Loss level which we have calculated here so I'll just copy that and put

57
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,580
it in and take profit.

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,650
We've also calculated that to take profit in anything else.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:35,510
Yes it's asking us for a comment and a comment company we will say my first order exclamation mark.

60
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,820
And we're not going to put in any of these parameters because we don't actually need to alter them we'll

61
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,670
just leave the defaults and semi-colon at the end.

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,250
We'll compile this as you can see here.

63
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,070
It's returning a warning the return value of this function should be checked.

64
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,360
We're not going to worry about that.

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,550
Now we'll look at that in next to Tauriel.

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,810
For now that's fine for us as just a warning it's not an error.

67
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,740
So we've compiled that compiles go to the terminal OK.

68
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,030
So we're in the terminal.

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,520
And before we do anything that will basically of course you have to open the char will open your adult

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:24,430
chart and I'll quickly pretty this up to get rid of the grid.

71
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,820
Zoom in a little bit so we can see the action.

72
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:37,120
And now before we do anything we have to remember that for our algorithmic trading systems to work in

73
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,450
meditative for they have to be switched on.

74
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,120
So there's no way here you can see order trading is going to Redburn right now.

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,520
That means that all algorithmic trading systems are switched off and even if you try to pull them onto

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,600
the chart or launch them Thuram from the navigator they won't work.

77
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,580
Nothing will happen.

78
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,540
So now we're just going to press the button it's turned green.

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,110
That means all algorithmic trading systems are now allowed to trade.

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,440
And now we're going to find our script script a tutorial 15.

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:20,310
I'll just switch here to the trade view and here you can see that my balance is $5000.

82
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,440
Of course this is a demo account and I don't have any open orders at the moment.

83
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:34,840
I have just one county history transaction which is a deposit on the demo account so back to the trade

84
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,830
view.

85
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,100
Ok now I'm going to pull this tutorial 15 script onto the your adult chart.

86
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,520
As you can see right away we have these three tabs.

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,980
Last one is inputs and inputs we can choose take profit and Stop-Loss levels so we'll leave them at

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,360
default for now and we'll click OK.

89
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,090
So you can see he's brought up the alert statement and of course our orders have.

90
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,890
Order has opened.

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,100
So let's go here to the bottom.

92
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,000
We can see your adult all Order has opened.

93
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,010
The buy it's a buy order.

94
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,390
It's a total of one law that has been bought.

95
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:24,280
The price is 1 3 6 3 3 which was ask ask price when the order is open stop loss levels 1.3 6 to 1 which

96
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,560
is the same as in our message 1.3 six for one is a take profit.

97
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,950
Same as in our message which means everything is work correctly and we'll just close as a message for

98
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,050
now and we'll open up.

99
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,760
We'll add a section called the Commons section and in the Commons it's probably very small on your screen

100
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,950
but you can see here it says my first order exclamation mark.

101
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,610
So basically there you go.

102
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,310
Congratulations you've actually just opened your first order.

103
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:04,710
And that's that's a very big step and you should be proud of yourself that you've made it this far.

104
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:14,110
And yes so in the next tutorial we're going to look at how functions work and have a play Orangi can

105
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,630
open as many or as you want you can change this to 20 30 and it will open another order and you can

106
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,310
see now we have two orders.

107
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:32,470
So basically play around with that next fall and next to Tauriel we'll go in more depth on functions.

108
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:40,240
Hope you enjoyed the Tauriel don't forget to look on for ex-beau dotcom where you can find the source

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,340
code and more comments and more free tutorials.

110
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,900
And until next time happy coding.
