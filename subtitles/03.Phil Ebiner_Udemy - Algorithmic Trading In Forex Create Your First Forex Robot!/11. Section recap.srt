00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello this is Carol from for example dot com.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,870
And welcome to the third first tutorial on algorithmic training for beginners.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,300
In this tutorial we're going to recap on the fourth section of our course which is called putting it

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,760
all together.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,390
So in front of us here you can see the website where I post all these courses.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,020
It is called w w w dot for X-posts dot com.

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,400
And now currently we're in the courses section.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:41,020
So if we scroll down here to the section before putting it all together this is these are the tutorials

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:49,180
that we're going to quickly run through now so expert advisors are great for here we discussed the differences

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:57,040
between expert advisors and scripts and so we understood that expert advisers have this module which

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,560
is called on Tich which gets executed with every new tick which comes into the terminal and in that

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,570
way they were different scripts.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,620
Then we talked about rule based decisions and algorithmic trading and we found out that there are quite

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:19,150
a lot of different types of rule based decisions but in this course we only looked at three main ones

15
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:27,220
which are price based decisions on time based decisions and indicator based decisions.

16
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,510
Next internal number 23.

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:39,820
We talked about strategy ideas and understood that for a new trading strategy whether it's a manual

18
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,270
trading strategy or training strategy for an algorithmic trading system there has to be an idea at its

19
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,770
core.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:56,200
And given that we came up with an idea for our trading strategy which was to trade the British pound

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:05,830
dollar somewhere around 8:00 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning when the European session opens and in order

22
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:15,160
to capture retracement movements next we talked to we put that trading strategy idea into a trading

23
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,320
system and create a blueprint for that trading system.

24
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:27,580
So this was a very important tutorial because here we did a lot of ground work for our forex robot and

25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:36,290
which simplified which significantly simplified the coding process process going from there internal

26
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:46,030
number 25 we coded the time conditions and we made sure that the algorithmic trading system opens orders

27
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,160
at a certain hour of the day which was 9:00 in the morning.

28
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,230
And also very important we created a using flags.

29
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,680
We created a module which checks that the system is only executing its algorithm on the very first take

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,620
of the hour when it's supposed to work.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,910
And that helped us avoid duplication of trades.

32
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,260
Next we coded the green section meaning submission of orders to the market.

33
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:23,950
And finally in Toronto the 27 we coated the red section which was closing any existing orders before

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,250
opening new ones into tural 28.

35
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,650
We tested all forex robot and optimized it and this allowed us to get an array of really good parameters

36
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,350
out of which were all profitable out of them.

37
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:46,750
We chose the first set of parameters in the fourth set of parameters and we took them go further down

38
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,810
further on and talk course to see if we can improve them.

39
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:58,900
And we tried improving them in the next tutorial tutorial 29 where we attempted adding a moving average

40
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:09,700
filter and C and in order to cut trades and basically tell our trading algorithmic trading system when

41
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,940
it can trade and one cannot trade.

42
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:21,040
And finally in turn number 30 we evaluated effectiveness of the filter with default parameters and we

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:31,330
saw that with the default parameter the filter is not effective and it's making our system work worse

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
than it was.

45
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:42,670
But then we optimized the filter for a given set of parameters and we saw that by optimizing the filter

46
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,300
we can actually improve performance of the system.

47
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:55,510
And that that was the end of this section and I just wanted to say that it's been a very intense part

48
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:04,260
of the course and we created a whole trading strategy from scratch and we saw the this from start to

49
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:13,590
finish so all the way from a trading strategy idea we went through the coding part of the creation of

50
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,900
training strategy and we even tested out for ex-drug but we optimized it.

51
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,820
We improved it with a filter and then we optimize the filter as well.

52
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:32,340
So quite quite a big part of the course and hopefully you've had lots of takeaways which you can go

53
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,060
and apply to your own systems from here.

54
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,030
And I just wanted to show you while we are on the site that how you can get to the source code so if

55
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,460
you want the source code for a certain tutorial you just have to click on it and that will take you

56
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,440
to the page of this Tauriel where there's a quick short text summary of what we talked about.

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,910
Then there's the video which you can watch in full screen more dried on the website.

58
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,650
And finally the source code is underneath the video and you can always just copy paste it into your

59
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:15,060
own Mitta editor or you can look at it as you watch the video just to follow what's happening and see

60
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,640
the whole big picture.

61
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:26,760
And also it's very useful to have on your screen if you want to compare your code to what was quoted

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,960
in the tutorial.

63
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:36,900
So hopefully this is useful and you'll be able to access the source code if you ever need it.

64
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,620
And while you're on for example dotcom I would like to encourage you to subscribe to the first book

65
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,290
newsletter which you can do on any page of the website and the top right corner.

66
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,120
Enter your email address and your first name and then just click SUBSCRIBE.

67
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:02,100
And in that way you'll be able to be updated on any free tutorials that I post or any new courses that

68
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,050
I come up with.

69
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,920
I hope to see you on the next tutorial where we will just summarize the whole course and maybe I'll

70
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:18,930
give some tips on what next steps you would take from here to further improve your algorithmic trading

71
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,050
skills.

72
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,440
And until the next tutorial happy coding.
