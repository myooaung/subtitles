1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,940
Flow this is Carol from for example dot com.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,340
And welcome back to the beginners course on algorithmic trading in em kill for and today we're going

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:22,780
to discuss what is in fact kill for now in the previous tutorial we successfully installed metal trader

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,620
for which is a trading platform developed by a quote software and medical software is a company which

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:38,440
was founded around 2001 and they primarily focus on facilitating online trading in the trade or for

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,070
package.

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,520
You got the Met a trader trading terminal which you can see here on the left and you also got the Mitta

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,690
editor development environment which we briefly launched in the previous tutorial.

9
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,750
So these two programs they are separate programs but they work closely together.

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:06,160
They met a trader for the trading terminal you can trade you can conduct transactions and see prices

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,430
and carry out different types of analysis manually.

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:18,040
And also you have some indicators and scripts which are prepackaged with the terminal and you can use

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,140
these to facilitate analysis.

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,900
On the other hand the Mitta editor is a programming development environment.

15
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,660
Or you could call it a software development environment.

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,290
It is a C-based.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,090
So in the original language that was put into the core of programming language in Mitta editor is c

18
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,540
but because it's a modified language it's called em kill for.

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,320
And that stands for Medek quotes language version 4.

20
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:54,520
And this language allows you to create programs that falser in logic and at the same time they are able

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,070
to conduct transactions on the market through the metal trade or for trading terminal and hence that

22
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,790
green arrow between the two because their work really close together.

23
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:15,850
So we'll just replace these with the relevant icons the meditator like is on the left and the old editor

24
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,900
icons on the right.

25
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,960
They have a new one since build 600 I think came out.

26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,770
It looks like a little yellow book but I can find one at this stage in good resolution.

27
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:35,160
So the Mirror editor allows you to create three different types of programs or software.

28
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,730
And those are expert advisers.

29
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:43,060
That's the one on the left the boot the guy in the blue hat indicators on the middle and scripts the

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,770
one on the right.

31
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:54,010
So in short the scripts allow you to execute one of the actions on the X market like maybe close an

32
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:03,460
order or open a certain type of order or just a stop loss or perform like that one of analysis indicators

33
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,560
are well the name speaks for themselves for itself.

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:15,070
They can tell you they do some sort of analysis and they draw something on the chart or give you some

35
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,630
some information and it continuously updates as new information comes in to turn them on.

36
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,410
And finally the expert advises the one on the left and the guy in the blue hat.

37
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:34,780
They allow you to create algorithmic trading systems that will work continuously and they're not one

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,020
off.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,750
They just keep working as new information comes into the trading terminal.

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,200
So let's have a look at how the metal trader for trading terminal and Middx editor worked together on

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,900
the foreign exchange midair trader for once you have access to a broker.

42
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,340
Your broker provides you faxes to banks and other financial institutions.

43
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,150
And altogether this bill still states your access to the foreign exchange which in Medicare for looks

44
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,290
something like this.

45
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,520
The Editor On the other hand allows you to enhance your training by adding expert advisors indicators

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,380
and scripts to your trading systems.

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:23,030
This in turn allows you to generate lots of money by automating the whole extent or part of your analysis.

48
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,800
And this is actually called algorithmic trading when you substitute part of the decision making process

49
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,350
that you perform manually with a piece of software which can either be an indicator script or an expert

50
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,190
device.

51
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:47,680
In this beginner's course we will be focusing on learning and developing basic scripts and expert advisers

52
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:54,180
won't be looking at indicators as yet because this is this is a beginner's course and we want to just

53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,420
learn the basics of algorithmic trading.

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,810
But we will successfully develop some scripts which do analysis some scripts which perform actions and

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,130
also will work on creating I'll own fully functional standalone expert adviser which will be able to

56
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,660
trade in our Instead of us.

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,030
And so that's that's all for this Tauriel I hope to see you in the next one.

58
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,820
And until then happy coding.
