00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,160
A lot of this is Curole from for ex-beau dot com.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,120
And welcome to the 19th tutorial and algorithmic trading for beginners.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,320
And in this tutorial we're going to be talking about one more transactional related function a function

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:28,130
call for which allows us to modify orders which already exist in the market and this function is called

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,340
order modified.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:39,680
So with no further ado let's proceed to mid-to editor and start looking at how all of this works within

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,640
the code.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,900
So we're going to take tural 18 and we're going to build upon the existing code so we'll save this as

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,390
tural 19.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:01:02,150
It will change a number up here and there we go so we compile that it all works all compiles and I'll

11
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,810
just quickly recap on what we already have.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,270
We accept external variables from the trader.

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,930
We use these variables to calculate Stop-Loss and take profit levels.

14
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,330
We use the stop loss and take profit levels to send an order to the market.

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,710
Currently we are working with your dollar and then we have a failsafe mechanism in place so if there

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,890
were any errors when sending the order then will the trader will be notified.

17
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:37,220
Otherwise we know that the number of the order is stored in the ticket variable and this ticket variable

18
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,590
is used to further down the track in the program.

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,820
So this part is executed.

20
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,820
If there were no errors when sending the order we tell the trader that the order was sent successfully

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,790
and then this bit over here his bid is related to closing orders so I'll just put a comment here.

22
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:05,280
Osing the order and here we practiced closing the order and we told the trader that the order being

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,310
closed is going to be closed.

24
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:16,550
We used the order close function in combination of the ticket number to actually close that order and

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,490
once again we had a failsafe.

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,860
I would have a fail safe mechanism here telling us if everything went all right or not.

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,350
So we're not.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,880
What are we going to do is we're going to replace it.

29
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,790
The closing of the order.

30
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:44,970
We're modifying the order and that is going to just save us time basically and allow us to practice

31
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,750
modifying the order instead of closing it.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,280
So let's go ahead and do that.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,650
I'll just comment this out for now.

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:04,640
And then we'll just create a very similar bit to that but we'll modify the warrants that will say more

35
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,420
Maundy buying order and

36
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,180
let's just start coding it right away.

37
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,150
So alert we want to tell the trader that we are modifying

38
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,840
the order

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,430
then we will be using that order modified function.

40
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:42,700
So let's highlight this function and go into its help or and call for reference and just have a look

41
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,320
at it and how it works.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,760
So the order modified function it all just transfer this

43
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,890
in Q4 so it's in a bigger font.

44
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,160
So that's how it looks.

45
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:08,840
The order modified function has takes several variables which are ticket price subclause take profit

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,190
expression and color and returns a boolean.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,090
So it's similar to both the order send function and order close function.

48
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,990
It's similar to the order close function in the sense that it returns a boolean.

49
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:30,020
So we already know and we can check this and confirm this with reference that boolean means that if

50
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,880
the function succeeds it returns true.

51
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,420
Either way the trans folds.

52
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,880
So in that sense it's very similar to the order close function.

53
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,650
And it is similar to the order center function in the way that it requires.

54
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:52,730
You can posse's Stop-Loss and take profit parameter to it which allows you to control those two levels

55
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,890
associated with the order you're modifying.

56
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,170
And also you can change the price but that is something separate that is for the changing price only

57
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:10,130
relates to pending orders and that's something we're not going to be looking at for now.

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,910
We'll we'll look at that in the more advanced course of them kill for.

59
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:25,310
But at this stage we don't need to worry about the price and the ticket number is the number basically

60
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,650
and ticket number of the ticket office of the order that you'd like to modify.

61
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,630
And these two last parameters the expiration also relates to pending orders which we won't be worrying

62
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,490
about for now.

63
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,220
And the color we basically know we're about the color.

64
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,860
I just use the default settings.

65
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,560
So that's that let's create order and modify function.

66
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,670
So we have the ticket.

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,390
We know that we have that variable double price because we're not modifying impending order we will

68
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:07,460
just put zero full price because order is very open so we can change the price stop loss and take profit.

69
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,700
So this is the main probably the main reasons why you would want to power in order to adjust the Stop-Loss

70
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,890
though or the take profit level.

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,840
So that's what we'll do we'll.

72
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,820
We will adjust the stop loss and take profit level and set them for example to 20 pips or we'll actually

73
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,360
set them to double of what the trader has asked for.

74
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,600
So we'll take we'll take the bid price for this.

75
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:49,160
So this is a stop loss for so for the stop loss will take the bid price and we'll track it two times

76
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,670
of Stop-Loss and then multiply it by point.

77
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,240
So this is if this is 10 then this is 20 and this is 20 pips so 0.00 to zero.

78
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:11,490
And then we subtract 20 picks from the bid price and we'll do a similar thing for a profit.

79
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:23,640
It will be plus two times take profit Times point and we have to put a zero for daytime exploration

80
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,620
because it is a required parameter.

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,150
But in this case he'll be ignored.

82
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:42,140
Semi-colon our same thing as previously will have a bool arrests variable just to create a failsafe

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,700
mechanism.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,460
We can actually just copy this from here put it in and if resits falls then we want to say Alert area

85
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,780
not closing or about modifying or

86
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:12,380
and otherwise order modified successfully and so we'll do one more sneaky thing here we will add a delay

87
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:22,240
and that what that will do is actually before after opening the order so after all this happens but

88
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:30,200
before all of this happens we want to maybe wait for one second so that we have a chance to actually

89
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:39,770
look at the chart and see what what has happened and then we'll modify the order so it's not necessary

90
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,130
but it's something.

91
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,380
It's good to know.

92
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:51,560
So the delay is given by the sleep function and sleep tells the program to stop working for a certain

93
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,050
amount of milliseconds.

94
00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:00,920
So in this case we want to stop working for let's make it two thousand milli seconds which is a delay

95
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,030
of two seconds.

96
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,940
I'm pretty sure this can come in handy in some of your programs down the track as well.

97
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,580
So we'll compile that no errors or warnings and then go to the terminal and see how this works.

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:28,600
So if you go to scripts take total 19 drag it onto the chart inputs as you can see 10 and 10.

99
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,110
Sorry.

100
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,130
So that's what happens when there has been an error.

101
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,470
And luckily our failsafe mechanism has picked that up.

102
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:48,060
So in this case the error was that expert advisers and scripts Well basically all algorithmic trading

103
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,050
systems are switched off.

104
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,210
So we have to switch it on up here.

105
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,320
And the way I know it I just in this case I just remembered that they were off.

106
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,770
But from that message we can't really tell what the error was.

107
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:14,160
And that's something we won't go into that amount of detail in this course but if you'd like to learn

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,270
more about that and I encourage you to have a look at the more advanced course on for.

109
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,790
So now just drag a tutorial 19 over the chart.

110
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,550
So 10 and 10 will click OK.

111
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,650
So there you go or is opened and now order has been modified.

112
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,170
I hope I hope you saw that.

113
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,590
Let's let's quickly go back and change the delay four to five seconds for example compile that.

114
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,570
OK.

115
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,930
Total 19.

116
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,800
So I'll just close this order so it's not in no way

117
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,720
Toral 19 drag.

118
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,670
So let's say let's take profit 20 and then it should be changed to 40.

119
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,460
All right.

120
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,610
So there it is the order has been opened now in a few seconds.

121
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,580
It will be modified.

122
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:21,080
They go as you can see the tape profit and the Stop-Loss have doubled and that's exactly what we were

123
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,340
looking for.

124
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,930
So that's that that's how you modify orders in Q4.

125
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,950
And I hope that this tutorial was useful.

126
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,220
Have a play around with that and maybe create your own rules for modifying orders and to what levels

127
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,140
you want to modify.

128
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:49,170
Maybe it might be worth adding extra external parameters just to for the new stop loss and take profit

129
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,350
and just to basically train up your skills a little bit more.

130
00:11:53,570 --> 00:12:01,720
As always you can find the source code of this Tauriel on w w w dot for export dot com.

131
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,070
I hope to see you on the next tutorial.

132
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,450
Until then coding.
