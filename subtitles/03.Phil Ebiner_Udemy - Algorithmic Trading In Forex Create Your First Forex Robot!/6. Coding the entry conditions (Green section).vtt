00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.860
Hello this is Kiril from for ex-parte dot com and welcome to the twenty six tutorial on algorithmic

2
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.940
trading for beginners in the previous tutorial we started programming our very first algorithmic sharing

3
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.280
system and we did this blue part of our overview diagram and today we're going to do.

4
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.690
We're not going to do the read part yet.

5
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.090
We're going to do the green part.

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.260
So I'll move to the detailed diagram over here.

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.120
And so basically we're going to skip this part and we're going to just connect to the green part right

8
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.320
away so we're not going to delete any or open orders if they are if they are still open which is going

9
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.570
to code this green bit.

10
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.710
But we will leave out the moving average filter for now.

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.140
So we'll just code the entry condition for by and say a cell and the failsafe mechanism.

12
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:10.060
And that's what we're going to do today so let's get straight to it here in front of me I have this

13
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.310
simple system code which we started in the previous tutorial.

14
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.210
I saved a copy as simple systems turned 25 just for our future reference if we need to go back to it

15
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.950
and see how it looked at that stage.

16
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.090
But we are going to be building upon this code and so we'll be working in the system a simple system

17
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.530
door for file.

18
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.470
We had this alert for testing purposes and testing was successful so we'll get rid of it now to preserve

19
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.880
space and it has no functional function anymore.

20
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.830
We're where you see this common core of the logarithmic system that's exactly where we will be coding

21
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.270
today.

22
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.420
So I'll remove that for now.

23
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.030
We don't need that as well.

24
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.460
So here this is where we'll be writing our code.

25
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.240
So let's go to the diagram and look at the green part.

26
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.660
So what we need to check is if the price is lower than it was at the open of the market for the day.

27
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.270
So how we do that is we go if

28
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.940
so to access the price we need to use the open variable so open.

29
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:36.290
There are four variables or there are four different variables to which describe the price.

30
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.580
The prices of every channel are open close

31
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.440
high and low.

32
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.670
So I'm just writing these out for you.

33
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.600
So basically each one of them describes the relevant price of a candle but which candle you need to

34
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.780
specify in these brackets already here.

35
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.840
So this is actually an array but we won't be talking about areas in this course for beginners Aeros

36
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.730
we will be discussing further in the more advanced course of them kill for which you can also find an

37
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.910
adult for Explore dot com.

38
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.570
But in this course we'll just look at these square brackets as somewhere where we can enter a number

39
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.590
of the candle that we want to get the price for.

40
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.990
So in this case we will be looking at the open price and the way it works is.

41
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.300
So I'll just quickly jump to the terminal.

42
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:51.140
So if we change this to candle's and we zoom in a bit then in emule for him in trade for the way it's

43
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:59.260
structured is this candle over here to insert text that's right.

44
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.540
This candle over here is candle number zero.

45
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.210
That's candle number sir.

46
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.550
This one than the one next to it.

47
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.640
Is candle number one

48
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.740
and the one next to it is candle number two.

49
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:31.780
And so on and so basically the candles are numbered from right to left and so the current candle is

50
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.720
always candle number one zero then the one next to is number one number next to number two and so on.

51
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.860
So this one would be three four five six seven eight.

52
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:50.350
So if you want the opening price of the candle then you would type in opening them in square brackets

53
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.680
you'd type in eight and you would get this price over here at which it was kind of was opened or if

54
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.220
you want the low price of the seventh candle you type in low square brackets seven and you'd get this

55
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.020
presser here.

56
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:12.100
So for us when the expert advisors working we want to know if we are in this if we're in this modular

57
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.690
here than the current hour is equal to Starro So it's a 9000 So that means we are exactly in this candell

58
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.190
we're ready there.

59
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.710
And so for us in that hypothetical situation that will be the zero candle that will be the one candle

60
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.110
and that will be the two candle and so on.

61
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:42.220
So that's where we are in no we're in that candle so we need to look for the opening in zero price so

62
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.660
we want to know at which price this candle opened and we will get that price over there.

63
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.290
So if we want to zoom in a bit more that's better.

64
00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.560
So that third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth or ninth tenth So that's in this case there was 10 Cannell

65
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.780
So our algorithm will be actually working like this.

66
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:16.170
It will see this as a candle number zero candle number one candle number two and so on.

67
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.220
So two three four five six seven eight nine.

68
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.710
So this candle will be candle number nine.

69
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.840
And therefore we want to compare the open price of this candle and the opening price of the start of

70
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.070
the day which is actually the ninth candle.

71
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.510
So we want to see if our what does our algorithm tell us is price lower.

72
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.860
So we want to see if open zero is less than open.

73
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.260
Candle number nine.

74
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.280
And that old compared this open price to this open price.

75
00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:04.430
But what we can enhance this a bit more by checking the following condition we can instead of checking

76
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.760
open number nine.

77
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.750
We want to check open start our Because Taar hour is nine.

78
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:17.610
But if say the trader changes start hour 10 or 12 we want this value to change as well so we're going

79
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.250
to change this.

80
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.340
None of start out.

81
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:26.550
I hope that makes sense that we're actually replacing and nine Wipha nine but parameterised nine.

82
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.930
So this if this can now change if the trader changes it and makes the algorithm more versatile.

83
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.410
So if the trader wants to look at this can also basically he'll look like that look at it the trading

84
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:45.150
system that way this will be 0 1 2 3 and this will be candle number 14 or 15 or whatever it is at this

85
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.050
stage.

86
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.160
So that's that's our first check over here.

87
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.830
We're checking if the price is lower than it was at the start of the day today and now we're going to

88
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:04.860
ignore these two checks for below above and we're going to implement are sending of orders.

89
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.910
So if that is the case then we will open a buy order else if it's not the case then we will open a sell

90
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:18.900
order and I'm intentionally ignoring the situation where open is equal to open because that is very

91
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:26.430
rare and I don't mind if it falls under this case and Alegate I know algorithm if you want to filter

92
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.330
it out completely.

93
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:35.790
So if you want to be fair on both sides you would put here if open is greater so that would filter out

94
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.440
the situation when they're actually equal.

95
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.120
But I'm not going to talk about that.

96
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.200
So just to make the code simpler at this stage.

97
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:52.230
So what we're going to do is we're going to send our order to send an order we need a ticket variable.

98
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.880
And we're also going to make it static.

99
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.520
So our function remembers the value of ticket through our it's execution.

100
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:08.490
We're going to set ticket desire initially and then here we're going to use order send to send a ticket.

101
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:17.160
So here instead of typing like we did previously Uri's is dollar or in this case British bungees dollar

102
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.700
What are we going to do is we're going to use a function which tells us which chart the program is working

103
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.130
on the Grisman trading systems work on this function is simple and that just basically returns

104
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.820
the name of the symbol where the trading algorithm is being executed.

105
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:46.770
CMT is which way want to buy or sell so is by volume so volume to get the volume we want the trader

106
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:55.460
to actually be able to change the volume because based on your number the amount of funds on your accounts

107
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.030
you might want to set low volume.

108
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:03.830
So we're going to introduce an external variable and will be a lot of lots and it will sort of Tujuan

109
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:10.470
an issue we don't even need this point so will just set it to 1 and then we will use it here as the

110
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.230
volume of the transaction the price that we were at which we wanted to open the order.

111
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:26.070
Well the buy orders are always open to ask price slippage we're going to set it and Pipps and then stop

112
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.700
loss.

113
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:33.090
We're going to we're going to let the trader in put a stop loss and take profit as well so we'll have

114
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:44.740
an extra in in take profit here which will set or originally say at 40 Pipps and we'll have an extra

115
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.950
and stop loss here as well.

116
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.640
We said it's 40 pips.

117
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.250
I'm just going to make this look a bit better.

118
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.660
Okay that looks better.

119
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.240
All right.

120
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.870
So start out as 9 to profit 40 40 lots one.

121
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:21.180
And here we will use those take and stop loss and as you recall we always do a calculation Stop-Loss

122
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:32.590
bid minus Stop-Loss times point and bid plus take off times point

123
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.420
anything else we can put a column into some

124
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.390
said by simple system so we know that these orders have been set in the system.

125
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:56.080
Once again we're ignoring the last three parameters award or send because we don't need them at this

126
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.100
stage.

127
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:05.230
If you recall we used to calculate this as a separate variable in our scripts when we were practicing

128
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.100
to send orders.

129
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:12.000
But you don't have to do that you can put the calculation right in here and then it will be sent.

130
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.280
So we first calculate it and then will be sent off as a parameter to or reset.

131
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:23.440
So it's up to you if you want to take this out and you want to have a variable here which is which would

132
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:33.390
be double Stop-Loss level and calculate like that and then put this variable in here instead.

133
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.630
It's up to you can do that.

134
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.440
That is more comfortable for you.

135
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:44.890
But I was just going to leave it inside because it takes that space and it looks it looks better from

136
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.770
my perspective.

137
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.620
So here we'll have a say failsafe mechanism if ticket is less than zero.

138
00:12:51.640 --> 00:13:00.260
This is a standard one we've been coding for a while now no error sending order.

139
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.440
Exclamation mark done.

140
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.550
So that's our Send.

141
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.270
Order order sent for a

142
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.730
buy order.

143
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:18.570
Now we're going to do the same for a sell order we'll just copy that to be a bit quicker.

144
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:26.730
And when you when you do copy there's always a few things you have to change after change this to open

145
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.310
sell.

146
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.820
A lot stays the same the price at which you buy or sell is different.

147
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.890
You buy you open bid sell orders at the bid price the slippage is the same again.

148
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.890
This is important.

149
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:47.340
This changes to OSC plus stop loss because it's a cell orders it's upside down the stop losses above.

150
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.940
And this changes to OSC minus a profit take profit is below the order and the commons stays the same.

151
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.270
So that's just a quick way of keeping your code and that's it.

152
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:04.470
So we can compile that no errors or warnings and now we can go back to the terminal.

153
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.520
Well it was just quickly check that we've done everything here.

154
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.110
So we've checked that we've been on these two for now so going straight through We've opened a did a

155
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.700
fail safe open a solid fail safe and that's all within this block.

156
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.140
If it is the first check.

157
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.380
So we have compiled that list go to the terminal and see how this works.

158
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:36.480
So I'm going to bring up the magnifiers so that you can see what I'm doing and I'm using the chair strategy

159
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:45.510
tester over here and I'm going to select our simple system there is expert properties I'm not going

160
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.720
to change.

161
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.800
They can say the same period H1.

162
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:56.020
It's British pound dollar control points.

163
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.890
We're going to change.

164
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.520
Actually we'll keep we'll keep control points it's just going to be a bit faster.

165
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.750
Date doesn't matter.

166
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:14.250
Make sure you click visual mode and spread can be current and then it will set the speed to 31 and we

167
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.510
just go ahead and click Start right click properties.

168
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.730
Taking off the grid.

169
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.600
So it's not in our way and now we're just going to follow our chart.

170
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.350
As you can see first order has been opened.

171
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.530
It is a buy order.

172
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.630
So I'm going to show the period separators and so you can see it is legitimately buy order because no

173
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.530
price is less than it was at the start of the day.

174
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.480
Here again to buy order because price listen as you can see they've closed both profitably.

175
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.080
This is going to move this a bit.

176
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.480
Apologies if if I'm moving a bit too fast I'll try to slow down.

177
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.930
All right.

178
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.830
So 09:00 is approaching let's see which way should be sell order.

179
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:09.640
That's correct because the current price is above the price at which order was opened and that's the

180
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.330
seller.

181
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.380
So it looks like it's working right.

182
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:21.200
Are we going to deep go a bit deeper into testing in the Tauriel off to the next one.

183
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.610
And understand how all of this is working how we test like a better strategies.

184
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.900
But that's all for today.

185
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:40.650
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial and you're feeling some sort of satisfaction from your programming efforts

186
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:47.690
because your system is actually finally yielding some results and I hope to see at the next tutorial.

187
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.230
Until then happy coding.
