Hello this is curial from Fargo dot com.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,930
Welcome back to the series of tutorials on arithmetic training for beginners.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,600
In today's Tauriel we're going to recap on the system design and trading functions section of our course

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,250
which we have just completed.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,800
So as you can see here I'm on the forex Board website and this is where I upload all the totals and

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,140
supporting materials to them.

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:40,630
So if you go to w dot for dot com and then click courses in the ribbon up here you should end up on

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,680
this page where the courses are listed.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,670
And then if you scroll down and find three of our current course you'll get a list of tutorials that

10
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,280
we will discuss briefly each day.

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:02,260
So we started off this section by talking about basic algorithmic trading system design.

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:11,410
And we had a look at two specific examples and one we used a fixed distance to said stop losses and

13
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:20,200
take profits and then we used price levels on the market to find out where to put those stop losses

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:29,730
and take profits and also looked at a way of maximizing the safety of our system in the next tutorial

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:38,770
we talked about how we can incorporate trader inputs and we learned the externe keywords in them kill

16
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,320
for which allows us to do that.

17
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:53,350
And then we jumped straight into sending orders on the forex market and we had we looked at an example

18
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:01,600
of using the order send function and we actually send our very first order with phenolic through an

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,980
algorithmic trading system which was very exciting.

20
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,950
Then we had to take a step back and talk about functions because functions are a very big part of all

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:18,460
four and as you can see here there's quite a lot of functions involved in sending orders and doing other

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,790
stuff with them.

23
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,400
And so here we compared functions to a blender and there was quite a fun tutorial.

24
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:34,160
Next we talked about Fail-Safe programming techniques which are an integral part of a good programmer's

25
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:42,370
arsenal and allow you to cater to any thing that can happen on the forex market and make sure that the

26
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,240
traders are always aware of what's going on.

27
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:57,370
And after that we talked about two more functions which relate to sending and modifying orders on the

28
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,060
4 X market.

29
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,350
So the order close function allows you to close existing orders and order modify function allows you

30
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:13,480
to modify orders and change their stop loss take profit and other parameters.

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:21,760
And finally at the end of the section we talked about the order select function which helps you pick

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,760
out orders by if you only know their ticket number and then get more information about them such as

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,310
where whether they've been closed or not.

34
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,320
What was Stop-Loss is currently set for that order what tech profits and other things and that will

35
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,620
come in very handy in our next section where we'll be talking it will be will be actually creating our

36
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,750
very first big trading system from scratch.

37
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,800
So that's this section 3 in a very brief summary.

38
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,470
I just would like to say that the next section is going to be full of very interesting and exciting

39
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,500
stuff.

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,090
But at the same time it's going to be we're actually going to be programming our system so pleased to

41
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:21,880
make sure that you're very comfortable with what we've discussed here and that will help you move through

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,470
this course very quickly.

43
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:32,830

So what else.

49
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:07,110
Well the site is full of supporting materials to the lectures you can also appear you can also click

50
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:17,640
on the About Me page which will take you to this small summary which I did for why I started this website

51
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,790
just me over here I had some fun with that picture and there you can just read about why I started this

52
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,770
website what my background is and maybe connect with me on Linked In Google Plus or Twitter if you like.

53
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,460
And always happy to hear from you.

54
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:42,240
Maybe send me a message and we can we can chat and yeah that's basically this website that I'm running

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,300
at the moment.

56
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,840
