00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.630
everyone.

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.610
And once again,

4
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.350
welcome to basic shell scripting section.

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.060
Okay,

6
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.310
so this is the section we're actually gonna get into Creating shells.

7
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.710
Gross.

8
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.160
The basic cell scripts.

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.440
How we could create jobs,

10
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.720
how we could run simple,

11
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.440
um,

12
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.510
echoes scripts.

13
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.200
Or how we could use input and output off our state mints to war with the shell scripts.

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.010
So what are we going to cover in this section?

15
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.250
So let's take a quick look.

16
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.670
First,

17
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.610
we will start by creating our first script.

18
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.430
Yes.

19
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.150
So this is the fun part.

20
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.480
Guys okays first Shell script.

21
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.190
You probably have written many shell script as well.

22
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.700
Ah,

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.670
and the basic one.

24
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.100
It might be like,

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.590
Ah,

26
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.130
you know,

27
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.550
like ABC for you.

28
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.220
But that's OK.

29
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.350
We'll start with always start with ABC.

30
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.360
So we'll learn how we could create a first group.

31
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.970
How we could execute and permission stuff like that.

32
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.250
Then we will create a second script where we will run basic tasks like based on our regular

33
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.790
commands.

34
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.500
We will run our basic tasks followed by the basic administration Task Adminstration task

35
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.080
Are those like if you are checking the disc base,

36
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.190
our memory and how can we put that in a script that will do all that automated for us is in

37
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.030
that fund that you don't have to log in any anymore.

38
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.190
And then run those tedious commands everyday to check your system and see how it is doing.

39
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.450
We will cover that in the lesson.

40
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.530
Okay,

41
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.970
then.

42
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.750
Well covered the defining variables.

43
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810
You guys know already about the variables,

44
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.150
right?

45
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.950
How can we define variables in the script and actually use it?

46
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.150
Input and output.

47
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.840
When you run a script,

48
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.460
it will ask you a question.

49
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.030
And based on your answer,

50
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.930
how is going to respond those type of question?

51
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.310
Now,

52
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.410
how does it work in the rial life?

53
00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.800
Well,

54
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.800
if you notice when you run a script in Windows or even in Lennox and you installing a

55
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.860
package or something,

56
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.100
it will ask you question,

57
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.320
right.

58
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.000
Do you want to go ahead and continue?

59
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910
You click quiet and says Yes.

60
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.340
Based on your input,

61
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.490
it does certain functions.

62
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.450
So that is about but output.

63
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.160
Then we'll have condition statements.

64
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.460
This is where it gets a little complicated.

65
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.370
But don't worry,

66
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.380
I am with you.

67
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.730
That's what I'm starting with.

68
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.440
Basic.

69
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.110
Um,

70
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.550
it's just like as if you are,

71
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.980
Let's say going toe a war and you were in the military.

72
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.450
The first thing they do is they actually train you.

73
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.650
So this is the whole thing is about training.

74
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.760
I wanted to start from scratch,

75
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.090
so you know everything inside out.

76
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.080
Then we'll have some additional conditions.

77
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.490
Statement.

78
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.180
But for the case statement and then four loops statement.

79
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.370
Why do we need four loops Statements?

80
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.350
What are the advantages offered?

81
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.080
Do?

82
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.490
Well,

83
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.100
scripts will also cover the Doo Wah scripts,

84
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.940
and the last one is getting online Help.

85
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.150
What does it mean?

86
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.270
Getting online help.

87
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.410
Now,

88
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.170
let me tell you this.

89
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.510
I'm not like a I don't know every scripting,

90
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.210
um commands.

91
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.370
I don't know every scripting,

92
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.900
um,

93
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.170
variables inside a script.

94
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.830
So sometimes I also go online and find help.

95
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.260
So I want you to also utilize that same technique to go online and look for Pacific scripts

96
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.750
that can help you achieve your goals.

97
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.750
So how can we get those on my house?

98
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.440
All explain it to you,

99
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.360
so sit tight.

100
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.820
Let's start or start,

101
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.750
but are creating first grip
