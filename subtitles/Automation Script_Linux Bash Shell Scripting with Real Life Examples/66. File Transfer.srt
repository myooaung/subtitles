1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
file transfer.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,420
There are many commands that are used to transfer files from one computer to another.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,400
As long as you computer is connected in the network,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,850
you could transfer files or directories for once over to another.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,540
Some off those commands are FTP,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,050
which stands for file transfer protocol.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,090
This is one of the old legendary commands that are used in many different up operating

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,600
system.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,650
It is still used in Lenox,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,390
Windows and Mac and many other offering system.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,100
This command is used next one we have SCP,

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,050
which is a secure copy protocol.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,360
And then the next one is our sink command.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,930
This command is mostly used by system administrator to perform ah files backups from one

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,490
system to another.

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:57,540
They could schedule those commands through Cron job to copy all those sink our sync files.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,080
So let's look at a few off these commands in our links environment.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,980
Here we have our links machine and I'm logged in as myself.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,030
So when you want to copy ah,

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,400
fire,

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,780
let's say I want to copy file that is called my first file.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,930
The first thing I have to do is type FTP and the machine named that it's going to,

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,750
which is a destination server.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:33,660
Okay,

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,970
so as an example to ftp ah,

26
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:44,080
file from your server to another server I have logged into my legs machines myself and

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,010
we'll see who you are.

28
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,160
You are self.

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:55,590
So before you try to do a trash for just see if you could paying Google because without

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,400
Internet,

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,410
you won't be able to transfer any file now I could paying Google.

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,440
It means my computer is on the network now.

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,300
Where do we have to trash for?

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,440
And what do we have to trash for now,

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,850
of course,

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,150
you do need a server that is running ftp demon.

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,120
Meaning your so for your client and a server that you're trying to connect should have FTP

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,660
demon running and a demon name is V s ftp deep for this training.

39
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,640
We do not have an extra external ftp,

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,050
so we will try to connect to the red Hat FTP server just for training purposes.

41
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,250
So the command to run is FTP.

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,750
It's based FDP dot red hat dot com and you will see as soon as you're connected it will ask

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,790
you for the past words for the user name and password.

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,210
So you provide the credentials that are given to you by the red hat,

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,690
Um,

46
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,630
support.

47
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,660
So when you end to the password and user name,

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,420
then you will enter the command put and the final aim.

49
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,970
And that's how it will be Trash Ford to,

50
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,510
um,

51
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,150
to the FTP site.

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,050
Now,

53
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,220
if you're trying to trash for to a server that is not running the FDP demon.

54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:26,280
So let's say in our environment we have PS minus CF and we'll grow up for FDP and you will

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,410
see there is no FTP Damon running right.

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:36,350
So as a training purpose will cry to trash for FDP toe our own server.

57
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,260
And our own server is local host or the name off our host,

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,990
which is my first Lennox host legs os.

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,140
So first,

60
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,370
if you ping my first Lennox,

61
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,890
the less you'll see you are getting your apply back,

62
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,220
right?

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,390
So it means you are connected to your own machine.

64
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,970
Of course,

65
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,300
let's clear it out.

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:08,160
And now I try to do ftp my first Lennox os and they use hit enter.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,930
You will see it says connect ftp connect.

68
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,980
Connection refused.

69
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,870
And why is that?

70
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:20,010
Because my server are My Lennox machine is not running the demon and the demon is the one

71
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,450
that listens to the incoming traffic.

72
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,010
So anyway,

73
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,550
this is how you run the FTP command and you transfer the files.

74
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,000
And again,

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,130
the purpose off doing FTP is if you have a new issue with your system and you

76
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,160
troubleshooting it and you involve,

77
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,950
um support,

78
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,380
whether it's red hat are sent OS or windows.

79
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,660
Whatever the support that you have involved,

80
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,490
they would ask you to send the locks and they will give you the FTP server account

81
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,770
information and credentials.

82
00:04:50,770 --> 00:05:00,680
So you would have to run FTP Command to send the logs over the other Commander V wanted to

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,430
cover is SCP.

84
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,110
Now,

85
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,780
SCP is basically copping ah,

86
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,110
file from one machine to another and of course,

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,430
this has s in front of us.

88
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,400
It means is copping it securely.

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,660
So let's take an example off a file that we will want to transfer.

90
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,250
Let's see,

91
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,680
was directly were in.

92
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,850
We're in our home directory and let's say I have a file called right here la la land.

93
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,220
So I wanted to take this file copy it from machine a two machine.

94
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,050
Be now.

95
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,720
Of course,

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,370
we don't have machine be where you want to transfer.

97
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,190
So we was use our own machine and pretend that it's a remote machine.

98
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,000
So the way it works is we'll do a CP la la Land,

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,380
which is the file that I'm trying to copy.

100
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,520
Or so where am I trying to copy?

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,350
Or I'm trying to copy over to another machine remorse machine.

102
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,650
So we're pretending they're more machine is,

103
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,470
which is our own machine.

104
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:56,980
Of course,

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,170
my first Lennox owe us.

106
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,640
And then you put Colon,

107
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,080
which is first,

108
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,150
is a host name slash Where are you copying it to?

109
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,150
So let's say I wanted to copy it to my home,

110
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,480
my user directory and the director.

111
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,440
You want a copy to,

112
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,810
Let's say,

113
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,750
Seinfeld,

114
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,470
Seinfeld.

115
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,910
It's a directory of wine to copy that file into that folder.

116
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:33,350
So once you have that command hit enter and it says could not resolve host name my first

117
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,600
Linux os,

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,130
Uh oh,

119
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,300
yeah,

120
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,950
because I have miss build first.

121
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:46,060
These are the type of things that you probably would have to troubleshoot you enter.

122
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,280
Um,

123
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,350
my first,

124
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,410
the Knicks O s still have coming up.

125
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,550
So what we do is we'll just take out this part.

126
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:06,240
So I'm just gonna What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this,

127
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,150
and I'm gonna paste it and then hit.

128
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,450
Enter.

129
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,500
Okay,

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,830
So it is saying that connect to host my first Linux OS port 22.

131
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,270
Connection refused.

132
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,400
So it is refusing a connection.

133
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,850
Why is it refusing?

134
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,960
Not sure,

135
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,650
but let's try to do local host.

136
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,230
Yes.

137
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,590
So you put in the password,

138
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:36,990
of course.

139
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,070
Your own password.

140
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,120
Because you're logging in as yourself on the machine as well.

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,150
This is your own password.

142
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,290
So once you put in the past where you will see it,

143
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,320
say's LA LA Land 100% completed seven bites and the right,

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,230
and it's 70.5 kilobytes per second.

145
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,910
This is amount of time it took to trash.

146
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,400
So did transferred.

147
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,560
Now let's where if I if Seinfeld directory has the LA LA land file in it.

148
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,900
So which director I'm in?

149
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm in home.

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,130
I observe,

151
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,350
Let's go to sign fill.

152
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,550
And now Ellis to do ls myself to your and you'll see.

153
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,930
Yep,

154
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,260
Right here is his la la land.

155
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,670
Very,

156
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,750
um,

157
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,290
Just to confirm that they that see host?

158
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,340
Um,

159
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,740
my first Lennox O s.

160
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,150
So it has one eye to 1 $61.14 Okay,

161
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,910
so now I know.

162
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,870
So this one,

163
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:42,470
I have hard coded my host name with 19 to 1 68 $1.14 And I'm sure why didn't work?

164
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,350
Because my I p has probably changed by now.

165
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,840
So it's probably hating some other device in my never and you see?

166
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Yes,

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,700
it Now my limits machine is one about 13.

168
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,840
And the reason I was not able to connect because $1.14 is probably one of my other laptop

169
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,730
or my iPad or some other device in my home network that got that got 14 i p.

170
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,580
And when I ran the SCP command,

171
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,640
it was actually going to Dad device Perfect.

172
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,010
It was a very good example.

173
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,210
Now,

174
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,550
you guys learn as well that how important s a tse while host father's,

175
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,660
I'll go ahead and modify that have become route,

176
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,730
and I'll do V I at C host,

177
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,650
and I'll just take these two entries out.

178
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,440
I'll just leave these two in close.

179
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,090
So now if you run that command that we were trying to run before hit a barrow.

180
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,320
Kia Paro key?

181
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,750

Right.

185

So now when you run that command,

186
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,350
you will see it will give us a prompt.

187
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,630
They go see right that this was the one,

188
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:51,930

192
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,290
It's connected.

193
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,250

Copy falls.

197
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,020

198
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,230
