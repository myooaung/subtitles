1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
system utility commands.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,950
These are very basic commands,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,780
um,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,480
that are being used in Lenox environment.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,240
Some off Those commands are just like and Windows.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,110
We have time.

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,890
You have a calendar.

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,600
Now Windows is a qui environment.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,520
You could view those time and calculators and stuff like that by going to the accessories,

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,380
but in Lenox,

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,290
it's not possible.

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,550
So so that's why they are commands that are being built to tell you to the date.

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,920
The up time information.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,740
The host name the You name the about the operating system,

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,630
which means where the commands are located.

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,600
Their calculators Sorry,

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,490
the calendar and the B C is binary calculators.

18
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:54,340
Now let's look at our Lennox machine and run these commands one by one Lennox machine.

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,680
When you logged into the going to the council,

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,220
you'll see the time here.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,800
You also have the option to go into the applications and pull up a calendar,

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,760
and you see all information that are automatically viewed.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,540
Um Vidal running any command.

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,060
But what if you are logging in through the party or the terminal client?

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,160
And as I said before 98% of the time,

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,130
you will be logging in to the party client to the terminal where you're not gonna be able

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,430
to see all those qui environment.

28
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,070
So let's look at the view through the party again.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:39,450
We will put in our I P addresses 1 90 to 1 68 $56.1 a one and I remembered by now.

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,790
And if you don't,

31
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,790
you just simply go back to your consul and type.

32
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,110
If config enter and the top right here,

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,520
this is the I P address.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,050
You punching that I p address right hair and click on open terminal A little pin up your

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,450
log in as yourself put in the past and you are locked in.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,700
Once you clear the screen and you will see here there is nothing but the black terminal.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,990
So and you wanted to run when you wanted to find out.

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,110
What time is it or what dated it?

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,050
It is just type date.

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,520
Tell you.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,320
Today is Tuesday,

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:26,250
March 13th the time and the seconds and Eastern daylight saving time and the year.

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,160
So that's what the date command is used for.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,350
It's very simple,

45
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,290
and sometimes that they commend is used to combine with the script.

46
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,740
So script will wake up checks the date and it will run.

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,150
Certain scripts will cover that in our scripting session.

48
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,120
Ah,

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,420
the next one is up.

50
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,250
Time up.

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:56,390
Time simply tells you along Been the system up for and how Maney users have been logged

52
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:10,530
into the system and the load average the next one.

53
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,450
It tells us about the host name.

54
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,270
Uh,

55
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,630
right here the host name.

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,850
Let's move this little to the side.

57
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,080
First name.

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
We could go back to our council.

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,460
They could do the coast name and you'll see this is the host name off our links machine.

60
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:35,630
And host name is one of the important command that I would recommend you to run every time

61
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,160
you log into the system shoe.

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,280
So you would know you are not logging in to the wrong system and you're not running very

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,550
critical commands on the wrong system.

64
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,530
Clear the screen.

65
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,110
The next one we have you name and you type you name.

66
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,280
It would tell you it's a little machine again.

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,680
The Lennox machine.

68
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,580
You do need to run this command because sometimes in an environmentally have Lennox you

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,550
have Solaris.

70
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,060
You have X many different links uh,

71
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,820
UNIX flavours.

72
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,720
So it's good to run your name if you want to know more details about you.

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,070
Name you type you name minus a Ever give you a lot more detail than just let me give you

74
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:25,450
the host named the kernel version the time it was built and other architecture information

75
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:25,450
.

76
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,880
The next command we need to learn is which Which command tells you the location off your

77
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,260
command that you run.

78
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,150
Let's say you run the command PWD right?

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:43,520
Andi tells you that the command is telling you which director you are in.

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,550
So where is that command located?

81
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,150
Of course.

82
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,770
Every command is a file itself and is located located somewhere to find out your type which

83
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:04,150
pwd And it tells you this command PWD is located and user Ben P W d.

84
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,260
If you want to know more attributes about this command,

85
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:14,250
you're on ls minus l user been pwd and you will see right here.

86
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,060
This is the script.

87
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,870
Actually,

88
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,010
the command itself is a script.

89
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,530
The script itself is a text file that has been written by developers and it tells you right

90
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,700
here it is owned by route and the group is owned by a route and that these are the

91
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,440
permissions off this file.

92
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,780
Everybody has the right to execute it.

93
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,390
If I take this bit out than I cannot run or nobody else can run this command.

94
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,860
So this is what which command does?

95
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,010
Let's clear this out.

96
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,760
If you want to know where is date command located it.

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,110
Command is also located,

98
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,520
and use have been date.

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,910
So as you can see,

100
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,550
most of the commands are located in user.

101
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,500
Been,

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,250
you do ls minus l.

103
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,610
And you see whole bunch off commands.

104
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,450
If you want to view one page at a time,

105
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,410
you could do more.

106
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,700
And you could see all these commands that we have there.

107
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,150
A bunch of commands that Lennox has.

108
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,320
What if I wanted to know how many total commands are in lyrics?

109
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,510
Very simple.

110
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,800
You do?

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,970
Ls minus l.

112
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,000
And if you remember you,

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Piper,

114
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,630
you do board count minus tell.

115
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,880
This would gives me the total number of all these lines.

116
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:37,150
That coming up is telling me there are 597 commands that are inside off this next machine.

117
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,800
Moving on.

118
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,980
Um what if I wanted to know the calendar.

119
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,170
If I just typed Cal,

120
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,350
it was Give me the calendar off this month and this year.

121
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,170
Ah,

122
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,440
what if I wanted to know the month when I was born?

123
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,890
Let's say,

124
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:07,510
for for training of Do Cal September 18 1977 salt type Sept.

125
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:15,710
99 start September which is the month 1977 and it will give me.

126
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:25,300
I could look at its Sept 18 Waas Sunday so you could type any a month followed by the

127
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,980
calendar.

128
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,620
If you just wanted to know all the months in the year 2016.

129
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,950
So you just have Cal to down 60 and I'll give you all those months,

130
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,920
uh,

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,520
starting with,

132
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,830
of course,

133
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,250
January ending in December.

134
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,200
That's what the cow of command is used for.

135
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,040
Next Commander,

136
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,320
you have as clear in this B.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,730
C.

138
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,120
B.

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,100
C stands for binary calculator.

140
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,810
If you want to do the calculation,

141
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,500
of course,

142
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,470
you could go in here and bring the calculator,

143
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,100
but you don't want to bring the country and going more.

144
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,060
You are in terminal mode,

145
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,620
so you want to use a calculator than what you do.

146
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,540
You type again.

147
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,950
BC it enter No if you wanted to,

148
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,130
Plus to enter and give you four.

149
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,380
What it 2 56 times.

150
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,490
Greed 21.

151
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,250
That's the answer.

152
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,740
So this is this the basic calculator You could do division,

153
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,460
multiplication,

154
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,390
anything that you want.

155
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,080
If you want to quit out if it just type,

156
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,290
quit and you will be at If it's that these air a fuse system utility commands,

157
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,240
Um,

158
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,720
and you could run that these are fun commands.

159
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Come up with the different options.

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Enough great,

161
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,360
of course,

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,560
to look at the options you could do man on every command and run with few.
