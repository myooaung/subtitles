1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
if then scripts.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,530
Now you know how to write script.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,470
Let's get into one.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,700
Step up some advance groups.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,130
Some.

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,360
If then scripts these air the scripts,

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,070
which will define some variables.

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,340
And if they're those variables are met.

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,750
Then you could run those scripts.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,760
And if they didn't script statement.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,670
If this happens,

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,250
do this otherwise do that.

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:44,380
So whatever that you define that has to be met,

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,860
then it will run it.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,420
Otherwise,

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,490
I'll give you some different output,

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,190
depending how you write a script to better illustrate this concept off.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,770
If then script statements.

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,450
Let's get into our machine.

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,850
Okay,

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,030
Mr To Be are in.

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,010
We are in our home directory and the directory inside.

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,170
Off it is my scripts and this directory.

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,150
We're gonna create a new script.

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:21,210
I'm gonna call it the our if then script again.

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,260
It does not have to be the name that I'm picking.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,850
You could pick any name like my script or X Y Z or ABC Anything that you want.

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,210
So when you we wanted to write a script,

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,550
you do B I and the name off the file.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,150
It will get you into the insert mode.

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,240
So the first thing do you do If you want,

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,460
Roy,

33
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,950
a script is defined.

34
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,180
Variable.

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,800
Now,

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,850
I already have a script written that I'm going to copy it from so it will save us time.

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:03,350
And this is the script which checks for the variable.

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm gonna copy it and I'm gonna paste it.

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,300
Now let's look at what's this group does.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,480
This script is gonna look for count equal 100.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,680
So if Count equal 100 which is the variable then is going to say echoed a Countess 100 If

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,450
it is not equal 200 that is going to say the count is not 100.

43
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,610
So that's what pretty much if else statement does.

44
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,180
So let's look at our script.

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,070
Let's run it that first save it.

46
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,290
And once we save it well,

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:38,710
of course.

48
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,770
Where fly the file is created.

49
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,650
Yes.

50
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,060
What's inside of the file?

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,580
The look into it and it has exactly the same thing that we typed in.

52
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,850
Now we need to give execute herbal permission to the script.

53
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,080
Verify it?

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,520
Yes,

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,460
it does have execute permission and I'm going to run it.

56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,770
There you go.

57
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:10,160
It says the count is 100 Perfect because we defined in our variable that the count is equal

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,160
.

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,810
200

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,420
So what happens if the change the count to,

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,880
let's say one?

62
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,370
We save it and we're on it.

63
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,920
Once we were running,

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,050
it says Count is not 100.

65
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,700
So this is the exact purpose off.

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,260
If then statements is if it looks for the variable,

67
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,070
whatever the variable is defined.

68
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,550
If the variable value is not met,

69
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,340
it will tell you exactly what you wanted to do.

70
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:57,450
You could also change the output by saying if then else I think.

71
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,890
Sorry,

72
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,750
the count.

73
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,460
Let's make a lower case.

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:14,150
Count is not 100 again.

75
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,470
Countess 100.

76
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,650
This is our variable.

77
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:30,490
And it says if bracket count equal 100 then a coed Countess 100 Els otherwise echo.

78
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,260
Sorry,

79
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,150
the count is not 100 fee Fi is the opposite off.

80
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,480
If and it is telling the script now,

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,210
you should exit out that your work is done.

82
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,160
And if else statement is done so you exit out of it by saving it.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,250
And now when you run it,

84
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,190
it tells you Sorry,

85
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,110
the count is not 100.

86
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,090
So you just change the output to whatever you want and that's what the If statement if else

87
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,190
our if then statement does another example off.

88
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,800
If else statement that I'm gonna pick is right here,

89
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm gonna copy it and I'm gonna create a new script is if then new,

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm gonna define the variable which I already copied.

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,120
And the first command I have clear it means when the script runs is gonna create the screen

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,120
.

93
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,860
I don't want to see anything that's already on the screen.

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:45,050
Next thing is going to do is if minus e which is used,

95
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,950
which is the option that is used to check if a file exists or not.

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,630
So it's staying.

97
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,750
If this file home my absolute narrowed a text file exist than what you should do,

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,070
you should then Atco file exist else.

99
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,750
If file does not exist then say echo while does not exist.

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,950
And that's what pretty much it's doing to Let's run this command.

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,040
And we,

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,600
of course,

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,860
have to give up.

104
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,020
Execute herbal permissions that's verified has excuse permission.

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay,

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,180
does no let's run at if now new Okay.

107
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,750
And you run it is this file does not exist.

108
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,710
It's telling you the actual thing.

109
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,190
Why?

110
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,400
Because there is no file exist.

111
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,850
There's do cat.

112
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,720
If then and it's the file exists where should define exist That fire should exist in my

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,680
home directory.

114
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,980
Error that text.

115
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,800
So I'm gonna create a file.

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
Now I'm going to just touch it,

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,570
and I'm gonna create this file.

118
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,740
The file is created.

119
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,480
Now I'm gonna run the script,

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,720
and now it says file does exist.

121
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,390
So this is ah,

122
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,440
sometimes a very useful command.

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,160
And it is very useful tool for system administrators who wanted to run this command,

124
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,090
um,

125
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,040
at a certain intervals or a certain day because,

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,790
um,

127
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,750
an application create some error files or not.

128
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,020
And they run this script on Cron job to see if the file exists or not.

129
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,770
If it does,

130
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,390
it means the application is running fine.

131
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,560
If it does not,

132
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,480
then it means the file doesn't exist,

133
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,610
and it will tell you an error message.

134
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,650
So this is F if then statement and we do have other effects else statements,

135
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,380
examples in this file as well.

136
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,960
And this file is also part off.

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,530
Your,

138
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,400
um,

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,890
resource is your handouts,

140
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,290
and I want you to try out every single script,

141
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:06,260
create every new script and try out different values that you have here.

142
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,950
So this is a very cool script that I have written.

143
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,470
It tells you about your name and it's still asking you,

144
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,380
Do you like working in I T.

145
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,180
And it asks you if you if you respond,

146
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,530
yes,

147
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,010
I will tell you you're cool.

148
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,870
If it does now,

149
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,100
you say you should try.

150
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,580
I t.

151
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,950
It's just a good feel,

152
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,180
so I want you to run the script on your own,

153
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,830
created,

154
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,800
create a new file,

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,470
write the script and executed,

156
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,650
and I'm very sure it will run just fine without any air.
