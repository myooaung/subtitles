getting online help.

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.840

let me tell you this not everybody is perfect.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.310
What?

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.350
Their expertise that people always learn.

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.330
Always learn.

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.990
And you're not gonna find anybody in the world who would say I got it all.

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.640
I know,

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.160
Matt,

12
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.200
I know everything about Matt.

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.160
I know biology.

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.150
I know everything about biology.

15
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.330
So what I'm trying to say is everybody Even if you become expert,

16
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.870
you will still learn newer things.

17
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.570
So people who are very proficient and export in writing scripts,

18
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.950
they still need help.

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:01.050
They sometimes get help online so they actually go help other people and also get help

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.860
online.

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.380
So if you're writing a script to date,

22
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.710
So let's pick an example.

23
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.220
Let's say if you want to write a script today and you need some kind off,

24
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.990

25
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.450
syntax in your script and something is not working for you,

26
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.280
you know,

27
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.180

ask question.

30
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.510
It's OK.

31
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.920
We don't know everything inside on our head.

32
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.210
Sometimes you do forget.

33
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.060
So that's what this lesson is about is getting your online help You should use all online.

34
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.170

40
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.050
search or whatever.

41
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.250
The search engine off your choice.

42
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.950
People actually even start writing questions nowadays with websites like Facebook,

43
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.130
our Cora or there.

44
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.820
So many other websites.

45
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.320
You actually go and pace your questions.

46
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.730
And you know what happened?

47
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.080

your questions is answered.

49
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.770
Now,

50
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.050
how people are answering your questions when they don't have interest in spending time for

51
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.250
you.

52
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.250
Well,

53
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.650
first thing is,

54
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.250
people,

55
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.060
most of the people are nice enough to help other people out.

56
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.700
That's one of the reason they actually help.

57
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.150
Plus,

58
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.780
if you help someone,

59
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.600
you are not actually making a difference or actually doing a favor to them.

60
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.740
You actually improving your own skills.

61
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.360
So that's why go online.

62
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.950
Try out all the resource is that are out there.

63
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.950
Second,

64
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.650
when you search online,

65
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.360
try to make precise search meaning don't just have ah,

66
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.880
vague search like linen shell scripting.

67
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.380
Well,

68
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.360
you're gonna get thousands off search results,

69
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.140
but if you're looking for Lennox.

70
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.750
If else statement,

71
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.130
you will get exactly if else statement.

72
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.940
But if you're looking for Pacific error that you get from l f l statement,

73
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.550
you will get that to Pacific.

74
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.350
So be precise,

75
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.020
then.

76
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.950
Next one is second opinion.

77
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.540
What I mean is,

78
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.550
if you find a search,

79
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.250
a new article on a website that someone has offered that you should do the script this way

80
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.250
,

81
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.600
then just don't be done with it and is like,

82
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.880
Hey,

83
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.020
I found my search.

84
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.850
I'm just copy and pasting even you understand?

85
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.600
No.

86
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.150
Go ahead and look for another such.

87
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.350
Maybe you'll find a better search an easier one that you will make you understand what this

88
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.150
is about and how the scripting works.

89
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.940
Then ask questions what I meant.

90
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.460
What I mean by ask question is,

91
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.750
if you are trying to look for something and that is not already answered by the community,

92
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.490
then you could post your question online.

93
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.550
If you're writing a script to actually delete,

94
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.360
um,

95
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.030
certain servers or toe wipe out or do past management on your system and you want to delete

96
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.150
those patches that are no longer used by users,

97
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.750
so and you need help.

98
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.290
Go put that question online.

99
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.150
And I tell you this people will answer.

100
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.350
People will reply back to your question with the right script.

101
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.550
So this way you will learn as well then at the end,

102
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.150
create your documentation when you write whenever you.

103
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.050
Sorry.

104
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.580
Whenever you get something from someone,

105
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.460
write it down on the documentation.

106
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.660
That's one of the things I always do.

107
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.820
I write it down because a year to year,

108
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.840
five years from now,

109
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.650
I will forget.

110
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.620
So I write down the dot on the documentation.

111
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.850
And once you become yourself and export a profession,

112
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.420
please go and help others.

113
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.980
Don't forget but you that you were helped once and people help you.

114
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.750
So now when you become good at something,

115
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.010
go and help out others.

116
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.450
Now it's your turn to return the favor,

117
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.150
right?

118
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.880
Okay,

119
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.830

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.850

127
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.430
Don't go.

128
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.010
Bye bye.

129
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.060
My preference.

147
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.770

148
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.160
So before you could come in and ask me question?

So you see,

156
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.380
you have a lot of articles here.

157
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.990
People have put in articles about understanding exit codes how they work,

158
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.450
spend some time reading it,

159
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.630
and you see right here they have given also examples.

160
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:48.300
Touch cannot touch arrest test permission denied and and the echo and the exit status.

161
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.700
Zero file ran all the different commands.

162
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.550
All the testing for codes.

163
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.950
Look for it.

164
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.120
See right here.

165
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.000
If dollar question more equal zero than Echo successfully created while else could not

166
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.750
create a fall.

167
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.980
So this is right here.

168
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.550
They use this exit code right here.

169
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.950
So it's about exit coat.

170
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:20.550
And let's say if one of the one of the script that we written in our course was,

171
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.680
check up process and kill it.

172
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:34.550
So let's say if I wanted to actually do that exact same thing process in Lenox and killing

173
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:40.270
Simple is that check up process in the Nixon killing fine and killed process,

174
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.710
you see?

175
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.500
See how it easy It is,

176
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.870
ah,

177
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.350
guide to kill people and kill all commands to terminate a process.

178
00:07:48.350 --> 00:08:02.800
And here you will have this website technical That explains you how you could find process

179
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:02.800
,

180
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.960
different commands to find process.

181
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.850
And what are the commands to kill the process.

182
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.940
If you want to do automate,

183
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.870
you could actually go and put your search precisely.

184
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.550
Check a process in Lenox and kill it,

185
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:28.730
and I'll put it a script to check and you'll find Shell script to capture process I d and

186
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.650
kill if it exists.

187
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.850
See,

188
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.840
you have to be Pacific.

189
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.750
What you're typing.

190
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.720
So click on it and you will find.

191
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.980
See right here.

192
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.450
People have written the script already for you,

193
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:50.070
so you don't have to actually spend time and troubleshoot your scripting code.

194
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.150
If it doesn't work,

195
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.350
you could try these out.

196
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.010
And basically,

197
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.920
I would encourage you to try every lesson that recovered in our,

198
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.020
um,

199
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.990
in our class.

200
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.730
Tried.

201
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.950
See people if see if people have script written in a different way.

202
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.770
See,

203
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.100
there people have answered.

204
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.480
People have questioned that I probably Randa's.

205
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.930
I tried this code and it is not working well,

206
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.050
you could also look for what is wrong with this code.

207
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.650
And then you will see answers right here.

208
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.920
It says this works good for me.

209
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.660
Perfect.

210
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.950
And then you try this.

211
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.250
This will make you rial real good in scripting.

212
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.050
Basically in anything that you wanted to do in life.

213
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.250
You wanted to you get answers and then eventually your answer people,

214
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.760
once you gain knowledge on that,

215
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.150
OK,

216
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.880
going back.

217
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.950
So let's say one of the,

218
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.570
um script.

219
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.900
Every road was,

220
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.300
um,

221
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.850
less unless all uses who are logged in.

222
00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:03.040
So I'll do script to list all logged in he uses in Lenox.

223
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:10.110
Make sure because we need a script to list all logged in users invent and Lennox.

224
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:16.100
If you don't put Lennox that it probably give you the information in windows as well.

225
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.930
Because remember,

226
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.490
in Windows you also write script and those scripts are back scripting.

227
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.380
So you're not bash?

228
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.180
Um ah,

229
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.050
power shell script.

230
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.570
So every operating system has scripting,

231
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.540
um,

232
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.280
capability.

233
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.660
So make sure you type clinic.

234
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.350
So anyway,

235
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.590
your next links less current logged in user.

236
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.050
Let's see.

237
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:43.420
Bash list logged in users name Terminal four ways to identify who logged in and in your

238
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.850
Lennox So many things that you will find.

239
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.570
Okay,

240
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.850
so now that's a You wanted to get mawr,

241
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.850
um,

242
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.850
examples off four loops scripts you could do.

243
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.850
Um,

244
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:05.630
four Luke script examples since four.

245
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.750
Luke mostly is in shell scripting.

246
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.620
But I would say put in Lenox for love script example.

247
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.150
Letting bash for Luke.

248
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.760
Example.

249
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.460
See if you click on it,

250
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.350
you're gonna find so many examples right here.

251
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.870
These people have,

252
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.390
or you could try different examples.

253
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.050
So many of them see what people have to see what other issues they had.

254
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.550
Lenin Bashar script for bash for Luke.

255
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:51.250
See how to look through a list for number 123 do echo number two and exit.

256
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.820
So basically,

257
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.230
what I'm trying to say is I'm not gonna go into more detail about searching.

258
00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:05.610
I think you understand now that what exactly I'm talking about so I'm saying is go ahead

259
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:14.460
and use your resource is don't limit yourself to ah book or to even my course or to a

260
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.950
person that you rely on.

261
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:22.830
This world is open for the whole war once this internet was introduced.

262
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.450
So you have a whole world on the palm off your hands on the lap,

263
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.330
which is your laptop.

264
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.170
So go ahead and open up your search engines and type of anything you want and you'll find

265
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.650
tons of resource is out there.

266
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:42.260
So that's why my focus is even if you are in Windows or in Lennox or in any kind of

267
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.150
capacity utilizing utilize the search engines,

268
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.580
see how you could use the search engines.

269
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.670
And this way you don't have to rely on anybody else to try it out.

270
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.630
Different searches,

271
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:59.630
and I'm sure you will find the answers that you look and once again,

272
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.250
good luck
