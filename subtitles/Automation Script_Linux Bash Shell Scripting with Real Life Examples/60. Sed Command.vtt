Hello,

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.870
everyone and welcome again to Ardell.

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.070
Newer Lesson said Command said command is a substitute command which replaces our

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.040
substitute a text with another texts or manipulate your file.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.580
It is a very,

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.440
very powerful command.

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.280
So what are the few things that said commanders?

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.880
It replaces a string enough file with another string.

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.590
So our string is a word.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.970
Ah,

11
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.440
sentence text message or any kind off text message inside off your file and that you want

12
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.570
to replace it finds and deletes a line.

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.650
So if a line has ABC and you want to get rid of that line in that text file,

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.590
well,

15
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.210
you could go in and use the set command and delete that line that contains ABC.

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.530
Now,

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.230
wait a second,

18
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.740
Imron.

19
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.270
Hey,

20
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.540
why can't I do the same thing when I goto v I and find the line and deleted?

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.970
Yes,

22
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.340
you could definitely do that.

23
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.170
But what if you have ah,

24
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.220
file that has,

25
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.560
let's say,

26
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.030
a 1,000,000 lines and in those 1,000,000 lines,

27
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.420
you probably have at least 1000 lines that has ABC.

28
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.510
Are you going to go into the file and delete or place that string one by one you think that

29
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.370
is efficient?

30
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.380
Not at all.

31
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.790
So that's why I said command is so powerful that allows us to manipulate the text inside a

32
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.250
file.

33
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.200
Another example that we'll learn is how to remove empty lines from a file.

34
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.470
If they are more than one empty lines,

35
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.780
how can you get rid off it?

36
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.350
Yes,

37
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.690
of course.

38
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.110
It going back to the same thing that you could go into the V I and D D and remove it.

39
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.880
But again,

40
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.160
this is not productive.

41
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.380
Remove the first line or number of lines in a file to replace tabs.

42
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.250
But space is these air.

43
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:07.060
The few very few examples offset commands that I'm gonna go over and substitute within V I

44
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.540
editor.

45
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.730
So if you are already in B I and you want to replace a text X y Z or TXT or anything with

46
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.300
another,

47
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.850
um,

48
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.400
text or another word you could also do by going straight into the V I.

49
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.470
But again,

50
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.390
um,

51
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.060
am I,

52
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.580
uh,

53
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.880
negating my statement?

54
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.900
What I said before,

55
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.470
No,

56
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.860
because when you are going to the eye and you you when you look for one word and then you

57
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.050
replace it again it's a manual process.

58
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.430
But there is another way in B I that you could just find that text one time and replaces it

59
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.100
everywhere in one shot.

60
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.450
And there is so much mawr and mawr,

61
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.530
That is,

62
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.280
um,

63
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.750
that said commands has to offer.

64
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.240
So I'm gonna log into my linens machine.

65
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.370
I'm gonna log in as a putty client,

66
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.450
and I will show you a few examples off How Said command works.

67
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.940
Um,

68
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.550
I'm logged in as myself.

69
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.450
I am in my home directory.

70
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.440
Um,

71
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.550
I have a file in my home directory that is called this duelist myself.

72
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.930
Your that is called Seinfeld characters.

73
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.050
So if you do cat on Seinfeld characters,

74
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.750
you will see all these characters off Seinfeld.

75
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.090
Um,

76
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.550
again,

77
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.170
it's just a list off all the characters that played in Seinfeld.

78
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.260
If you do not have that file or if you did not create that file previously,

79
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.400
then go ahead and you could just pause it right here and create that file.

80
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.870
But all those names that I have or if you want to use a different ball,

81
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.440
a different names,

82
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.030
that's fine.

83
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.610
It's just example that I'm gonna be using to explain how said.

84
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.520
Command works.

85
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.470
So I already have this file now The first thing I want to do.

86
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.110
Let's say what if I wanted to replace Ah,

87
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.900
one of the word with a different word.

88
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.050
Let's say I wanted to replace Kenny.

89
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.380
There's a character named Kenny Banya.

90
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.250
How about if I want to replace his name from Kenny to Lenny?

91
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:28.150
You would use the command said single code s for substitute Kenny with Lenny to slash Lenny

92
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
and slash again.

93
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.270
And if you if there are more than one Kenny,

94
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.070
then you could type G because this G is stands for global Every replace the entire file

95
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.950
wherever you have the word Kenny.

96
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.420
So by default,

97
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.130
I always juice G.

98
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.450
You should also get into the habit of G if you want to replace it everywhere.

99
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:58.800
So you you you close the single coat and then you type the name off the file where you are

100
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.360
trying to replace the board.

101
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.560
Kenny hit,

102
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.950
enter.

103
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.300
And now you will see at the bottom.

104
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.050
It is replaced with Lenny.

105
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.950
Now another thing.

106
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.000
Um,

107
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.530
I do want to mention that this is going to display the change on Lee on the screen.

108
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.140
It is not actually going to make a change in the file.

109
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.250
So if you get out the file,

110
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.950
you will see the name Kenny still there,

111
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.050
but didn't be just replacing Lenny.

112
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.880
Yes,

113
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.260
we did.

114
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.340
But it did not make the change inside the file.

115
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.170
It on Lee makes the change to the screen.

116
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.820
And if you wanted to have that output to another file,

117
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.560
you could do that.

118
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.950
And that change will be reflected in the newer file.

119
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.050
But if you want to make a change to the existing file,

120
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:59.730
then what do you have to do is you come back to the same command by hitting up arrow key

121
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.800
and you type minus I.

122
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.830
That is to insert the changes into the file the same command and you hit Enter.

123
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.380
Now,

124
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.230
when you do cat Seinfeld characters,

125
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.880
you'll see the name has changed.

126
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.830
Two Lenny permanently.

127
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.810
So this is how you replace Kenny?

128
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.450
Will any and save the file.

129
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.450
Now,

130
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.110
let's see.

131
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.530
What if you,

132
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.550
um,

133
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.170
wants to replace um,

134
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.750
the word Costanza?

135
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.630
So it works the same way.

136
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:44.150
So you do said substitute Costanza.

137
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.480
And this time you just don't want to replace anything.

138
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.040
You just want to remove that word.

139
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.000
So you just put Costanza and don't put anything in there,

140
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.270
G and the name of the fall characters.

141
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.800
You see any anyone who had the last name?

142
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.910
Constanza That is gone.

143
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.730
She were here.

144
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.280
Frack.

145
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.540
Costanza's going Stell,

146
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.580
Costanza's gone.

147
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.830
Another consents.

148
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.130
I have.

149
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.070
The bottom is gone.

150
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.460
George Costanza is gone.

151
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.380
But again,

152
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.840
this has gone on Lee on the screen.

153
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.660
And if you want to make a changes to the file,

154
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.850
you have to use the minus.

155
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.550
I option.

156
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.060
I don't want to use the minus I option this time because I want to show you how the set

157
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.450
work.

158
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.450
So this way the file won't change.

159
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.150
So just that's just confirmed.

160
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.520
Our file has all the correct names that I want to have them in it.

161
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.730
So it does have it next.

162
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:45.650
One I wanted to show you is how to find a string off line and remove it.

163
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.400
If you see,

164
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.250
um,

165
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.070
this is the 2nd 1 in our slide,

166
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.390
Find and delete.

167
00:07:53.390 --> 00:08:02.610
So what if I want to delete every line that has the word Seinfeld took for the command to

168
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:09.450
do that is said Seinfeld.

169
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:21.520
And this time type de de is to delete any character or any word that comes up the matches

170
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.190
Seinfeld.

171
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.090
That line will be deleted.

172
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.010
So I am not using my eyes.

173
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.640
I option because it will actually see make the changes to my father and save it.

174
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.790
I just want to show you.

175
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:39.700
So I just I'll just run it and you will see all the lines that had the Seinfeld are gone.

176
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.550
See none off.

177
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.950
This has the word Seinfeld's in it.

178
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:51.200
So that's how you replace or delete a line that matches a key word or award.

179
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.400
The next thing I wanted to show you is how you could,

180
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.500
um,

181
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.380
remove Mt.

182
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.810
Lines from a file.

183
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.830
So if I have empty line,

184
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.120
let's make them T line.

185
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.550
I'll go into Seinfeld characters and I'm gonna make empty lines.

186
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.420
So I have four empty lines,

187
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:16.840
right?

188
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.640
I'll just make one empty line right here as well.

189
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.840
Five empty lines.

190
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.650
Now I'm gonna save that file cat Seinfeld characters,

191
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:42.510
and you will see right here I have five empty lines.

192
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.450
I wanted to get rid of these five empty lines.

193
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.990
The command to do that,

194
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.710
IHS said.

195
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:59.000
Stash cap caps shows that anything that starts,

196
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.590
which is right above number six and dollar.

197
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.910
Anything that ends but dollar,

198
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.850
meaning nothing.

199
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.950
Then just delete that sign.

200
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.900
Sorry,

201
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.950
Seinfeld characters.

202
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:21.830
So anything that is starting or anything that is ending has nothing in the middle.

203
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.460
Which is the empty fall,

204
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:23.920
of course,

205
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.270
right?

206
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.850
So whatever that finds,

207
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.050
please go ahead and delete it.

208
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.120
So hit,

209
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.880
enter and you will see everything is gone.

210
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.360
But now,

211
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.450
if you do Seinfeld character again,

212
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.260
you'll see you'll still have the line.

213
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.530
Why?

214
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.600
Because we did not specify the minus I option,

215
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.300
and I want you to go ahead and specify minus I option.

216
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.350
Do a Seinfeld characters and you'll see all the empty lines are gone.

217
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:50.520
Now what if I want to remove the first line in our file?

218
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.270
Ah,

219
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.870
I just wanted removed Jerry Seinfeld,

220
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.630
which is the first line off the file.

221
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.790
So I will do,

222
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.600
said coat one D coat.

223
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.580
Close the name of the file and you'll see the first line was searched very sinful.

224
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.560
That is gone now,

225
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.070
of course,

226
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.790
again,

227
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:15.350
I'm keep saying it is not going to affect our file because we did not use mind's eye option

228
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.350
.

229
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.620
Um,

230
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:24.210
now what if you want to remove 1st 2 lines will hit up Arrow Key and just type one comma

231
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.550
two,

232
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.950
and it will delete the 1st 2 lines.

233
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.050
That's how you delete 23 or four more lines.

234
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.050
Now what if you have,

235
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.850
um,

236
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.640
tabs in your,

237
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.020
um,

238
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.050
and your file and you want to remove those tabs with spaces?

239
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:49.200
So if I do V I on Seinfeld characters and instead of,

240
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.850
um,

241
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.250
space is I'll just put tabs,

242
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:58.320
tabs and tabs Save the file.

243
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.150
You could do cat Seinfeld character.

244
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.650
You see,

245
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.000
three lines have tab.

246
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I wanted to remove all the tabs inside the file with space,

247
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.140
So the command to do that is said substitute slash.

248
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:22.780
You have to use backslash and T that tells the operating system for the show that this is a

249
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.390
tab.

250
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.420
Anywhere you find Tab,

251
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.250
please remove it with space and apply it globally.

252
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.450
Seinfeld characters,

253
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.680
You see,

254
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.250
um,

255
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.150
cope Didn't like something.

256
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.950
Um,

257
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.950
one second.

258
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:49.250
Oh,

259
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.550
my mistake.

260
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:56.330
I used backs last year,

261
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.840
so I have to use force.

262
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:06.120
Slash is here because this slash right here and this slash right here in the middle right

263
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.550
here is to string that we're trying to replace.

264
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.750
We're trying to replace that string with what would 70 line.

265
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.250
So now that should work.

266
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.700
And there it is.

267
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.550
It did work,

268
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.520
but it is so good not going to impact our file.

269
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.230
I'm gonna use that command of minus I option.

270
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:28.150
So it will make the change to my file and bring it back to this original content.

271
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.990
Okay,

272
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:36.620
so now that's how you actually replaced tabs with spaces.

273
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.020
If you want to do the same thing,

274
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.970
replace spaces.

275
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.550
The tabs.

276
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.650
You could do the same thing,

277
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.980
but just switch.

278
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.160
Ah,

279
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.570
backslash tea with the with the second a space holder.

280
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:55.880
So you move this thing to here so it will remove everywhere that let's say you want.

281
00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:05.450
If you want to try it t and hear any spaces that it's in their please replace it with Tab.

282
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:10.850
And I have to this year.

283
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.980
Okay,

284
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:37.380
So I believe sign fell characters.

285
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.620
And there you have all the taps in there.

286
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.790
I did not want to make the changes.

287
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.490
That's why when I was checking it,

288
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.330
it was not coming up anyway.

289
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.750
I wanted to bring it back,

290
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:53.760
bring it back around the earlier command which is this replaced habit spaces and hit enter

291
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.190
and now do Seinfeld characters,

292
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.510
and you'll see my format is back the way I want.

293
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.180
Okay,

294
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:01.690
now,

295
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.850
what if I wanted to,

296
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.150
um,

297
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:11.300
a show on ley lines from 12 to 18 from a file.

298
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.790
So I just wanted to view 12 to 18.

299
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.700
So 123456789 10 11 12.

300
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.380
So I wanted to see all the lines starting with J.

301
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.260
Peterman all the way to the end,

302
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.490
which is the 18th line.

303
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.050
I don't want to view any of these lines.

304
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.500
So for natural use,

305
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:45.290
the command said again with minus an option 12 from 12 to 18 p is the option that you have

306
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.640
to pick and you hit.

307
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.330
Enter and you will see right here.

308
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:54.010
It's giving me from line 12 to 18 now.

309
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.870
What if you want to view?

310
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.640
Ah,

311
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.490
the opposite way.

312
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:02.550
Meaning you want to be everything except line a 12 to 18.

313
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.640
Then you will run.

314
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.120
The command said Now,

315
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:15.180
don't use minus end Jews 12 18 de this time and Seinfeld characters and you'll seal.

316
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:22.550
You have all the results from the top except starting line 12 to 18.

317
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.250
Now.

318
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.120
What if you wanted to,

319
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.850
um,

320
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.900
put a put a space in your,

321
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.250
um,

322
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.500
and your file?

323
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.550
Like every name.

324
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.260
There should be a space.

325
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:35.730
There should be,

326
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.240
Ah,

327
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.300
empty line.

328
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.200
Um,

329
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.030
after each character.

330
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:45.300
So you will do said just G Seinfeld characters.

331
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.200
And you see,

332
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.020
every line has a space empty line,

333
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.490
then the name empty line,

334
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.170
then the name.

335
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.540
This is how you add it.

336
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.030
But of course,

337
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.970
it's not going to impact our file.

338
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.810
You could you could have that changes by putting in mind's eye option.

339
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.400
Okay.

340
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.890
Now,

341
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.460
um,

342
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.180
what if you wanted to replace,

343
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.380
um um,

344
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:06.780
like,

345
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.270
let's say,

346
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:16.020
if I have Seinfeld character and I wanted to replace Seinfeld with s or any other name,

347
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.390
but I do not want to replace number line eight.

348
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:28.570
So 1234 by 678 I wanted to replace Seinfeld with s except the eighth sign.

349
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:28.990
Fill.

350
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.810
So you do said single coat.

351
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:44.260
Do not do eight and substitute Seinfeld with s do it globally.

352
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.260
Seinfeld characters.

353
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.510
Okay,

354
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.550
See it.

355
00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.310
Um,

356
00:17:53.310 --> 00:18:02.590
the change one second may see No,

357
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.460
um,

358
00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.950
let's see.

359
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.670
So if I just type eight,

360
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.810
just subject sign of A s,

361
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.050
so it is still not doing it.

362
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.420
Am I doing something wrong?

363
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.210
Ah,

364
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.590
yes.

365
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.850
I am doing something wrong.

366
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.800
See,

367
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:29.850
sometimes just a tiny bit of a mistake Makes a huge difference if you notice there is no

368
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:30.390
such word.

369
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.760
A sign fled.

370
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.470
I put signed.

371
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.950
Fled.

372
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.360
All right.

373
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.450
It's a good exercise.

374
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.620
Um,

375
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.530
it enter.

376
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.040
You see,

377
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.550
every Seinfeld,

378
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.740
uh,

379
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.480
text award has been changed with s.

380
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.090
But now let's go back to our original question.

381
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.950
I don't want to replace number eight.

382
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.350
Fix my spelling.

383
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:59.660
Enter and you will see all of them have changed extent except line number eight.

384
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.250
Now,

385
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:05.110
the last one I talked about substitute while you are in B I editor.

386
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:11.260
So go ahead and type V I the name of the file.

387
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.970
And now you are India editor.

388
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.590
Now what?

389
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:20.350
If you wanted to replace every cycle character while you are in B I so you'll do.

390
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:27.910
Colon percent sign success for substitute slash.

391
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:35.160
Sign filled to Peter.

392
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.730
Right.

393
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.970
You want to replace every one of them and slash hit,

394
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.950
enter and you'll see every Seinfeld has been replaced with the word Peter.

395
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:51.050
That's how you make the change while you are nbr editor.

396
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:51.870
No,

397
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.670
