00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
difference between Lenox 56 and seven.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.990
Now,

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.220
as you gonna learn Lennox and you understand Lennox,

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.410
you'll know that you will be upgrading your system from different versions.

5
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.120
And the reason companies are livings distribution companies come up with different versions

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.710
is because they as their features existing features,

7
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.950
add new features and fix a lot of books.

8
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.370
So the reason im including this as part of a lesson or part of the training is because

9
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.820
maybe you have experience in Red Hat or Cento as five or six.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.530
And now you is time to move on to seven.

11
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.150
And of course,

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.950
um,

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.050
in my trainings,

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.350
everything on seven.

15
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.950
So you should really know some off.

16
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.010
The difference is the primary differences between all these versions.

17
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.430
So Santo s and rail or red hat,

18
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.770
what are the major difference?

19
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.350
Well,

20
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.510
as I mentioned a few times,

21
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.500
Cento s and roll are both exactly the same.

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.950
The only and only difference is that is that Red hat provides support,

23
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580
technical support to the customers,

24
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.090
and they also provide patches that break fixes.

25
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.570
Whereas santo us,

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.350
they do not.

27
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.880
It's a it's a free software and where you could get support in the community.

28
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.320
You just have to wait for someone to reply back when you post your answer your question.

29
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.250
So that's a primary difference.

30
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.980
Now,

31
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.220
what are the total worsens off Santo s and roll Red hat All the story from version zero

32
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.780
through all the way to seven.

33
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.740
Up to now,

34
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.450
whereas Santo s actually spun off the off off red hat when right have was at version two.

35
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.660
Um,

36
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.660
again,

37
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.260
the versions are the primary words in that we will be discussing our version 56 and seven.

38
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.110
I have ah Chee Chee,

39
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.150
which I have also attached with this lesson.

40
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.160
I'm gonna cover the chief sheet which you which will enable you to go over it and find out

41
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.950
what exactly the differences are.

42
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.630
So let's open up my she sheet.

43
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.210
It's a pdf document and I'm gonna code really quickly.

44
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.950
Um,

45
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.500
the differences off Red hat 56 and seven.

46
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.900
And please don't be surprised by looking at Hey,

47
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.760
this is only read had what happened to Cento us as I mentioned Santo s and Red hat is

48
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.790
exactly the same.

49
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.720
So let's start off with the first section right here says system basics so views

50
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.890
subscription information in five.

51
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.040
He had system I d six.

52
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.030
No changes.

53
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.630
Seven,

54
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.390
We have subscription manager,

55
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.870
which is in your command with identity Configure subscription.

56
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.190
When you want to register your system with red,

57
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.200
hot or very satellite,

58
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.230
then you'd run the command origin.

59
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.640
Underscore.

60
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.940
Registered 56 the same thing,

61
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.370
then five minutes.

62
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.930
Then at six,

63
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.260
they introduced subscription manager as well,

64
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.140
along with origin registered and in seven,

65
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.670
it's a subscription manager.

66
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.400
But now origin underscore.

67
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.530
Register is,

68
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.120
um someone deprecate id you putting.

69
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.170
They're gonna find in a lot of system a new abortion.

70
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.330
You system information how to get sa sir.

71
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.040
Poor d m.

72
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.220
I decode hardware browses some of these commands we have already learned stays the same in

73
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.210
six and seven.

74
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.890
The last command changes to L S H W,

75
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.730
which is list hardware to view the red hat version.

76
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.180
Information it is,

77
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.970
etc.

78
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.230
Red hat release.

79
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.250
It's the same across all the words is nothing has changed.

80
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.800
All you have to do is cat out this file and you will see the difference of you will see the

81
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.850
versions off your center s or red hat operating system.

82
00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.610
So this is about system basics moving down the basic configuration.

83
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.900
When you configure your system,

84
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.940
there is a command in five and six system dash config and followed by a second or third

85
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.890
other commands attached to it.

86
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.540
You could look it up when you do.

87
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.220
Ls minus.

88
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.420
L on slash Ben.

89
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.590
You'll find these command in real 78 changed to genome Control Center Configured network We

90
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.350
have done that.

91
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.920
System CONFIG Network is a gooey based as well an m I C allies the newer utility that you

92
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.940
should get yourself familiar with.

93
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.840
Run this command.

94
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.950
This will allow you to configure your network,

95
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.750
then configure system languages.

96
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.950
Um,

97
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.620
different commands in six and seven configured time and date.

98
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.940
We have NTP,

99
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.960
uh,

100
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.080
in the older version five and six.

101
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.670
And the newer one is,

102
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.370
um,

103
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.850
crony,

104
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.970
Crony Sea or Cron E.

105
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.090
D is a demon.

106
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.800
You could modify the etc quality dot com file.

107
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.500
Recover that already in,

108
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.390
and I believe modules.

109
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.010
Seven.

110
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.560
Then configure keyboard.

111
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.190
A couple of different commands from 5 to 6 text.

112
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.780
Big configuration tool.

113
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.760
There are a few different differences,

114
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.250
but there are same across all versions.

115
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.070
Configure printers.

116
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.850
I'm sure you don't have to worry about it cause a lot of times the next servers are not

117
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.350
attached to Lennox of sorry to printers or fax machines.

118
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.150
Configure samba,

119
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.050
same commands,

120
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.770
nothing change.

121
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.900
Configure a cessation.

122
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.550
Nothing changed.

123
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.530
Everything's sink.

124
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.620
Now we're talking about jobs and services.

125
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.350
There is configured logging is R a cist law dot com file and five and in six they changed

126
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.900
toe RCIs log dot com file because our stands for remote so you could also get remote logs

127
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.680
from remote servers so they enhanced it at immune new features.

128
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.060
Well,

129
00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.870
same thing.

130
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.560
Our system is completely gone now.

131
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.400
It's replaced with RCIs log lists of services you could do check config,

132
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.640
dash dash lifts.

133
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.750
This is to see what are the services that are enabled at Bhutan.

134
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.270
But in seven,

135
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.020
it has changed.

136
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.050
Everything is controlled by system CTL.

137
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.520
Now,

138
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.930
if you want to see the list of all the services you could do system CTL I leave,

139
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.010
um space dash dash list.

140
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.760
It will give you all the listing off services running or access this running process

141
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.010
service Dash s status.

142
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.780
All,

143
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.720
um,

144
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.390
in roll seven again.

145
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.450
System CTL start and stop the Service Service Command Service Command.

146
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.580
And here we have system CTL command system CTL commit.

147
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.000
These are the type of service we learn in modules.

148
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.470
Seven.

149
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.510
So pay close attention how they are changing.

150
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.750
So don't be surprised.

151
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.070
You should know both commands because if you are going into an environment where they have

152
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.180
a red hat 45 or six and seven as well.

153
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.430
So you should know which command can be used where there aren't a lot of changes in the

154
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.840
command.

155
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.330
But some of these commands that will make a difference.

156
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.730
That that's why I want to make sure they are covered.

157
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.230
Check configures a command that will enable service at boot time.

158
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.640
And now system CTL.

159
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.370
Does that service the same thing?

160
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.030
Check unfixed.

161
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.730
Same thing.

162
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.720
Um,

163
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.100
we talk about something wrong.

164
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:38.150
Levels now run run level has been controlled by system CDL as well That run the level can

165
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.460
be changed by going to that seeinit tab.

166
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.970
Now it is going through the command line.

167
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.230
You could change.

168
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.260
You can make the changes to their own level by running these commands You lost.

169
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.510
Nothing changed in war long war log.

170
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:57.320
But now there's a new command called journal CTL ritual provide you more information about

171
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.940
the logging configure system audit.

172
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:10.000
We do not have covered that thistles mawr off system that are facing on the Internet or

173
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.730
more vulnerable to this hackers attack.

174
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.250
But most of the systems most Olynyk machines are behind firewalls.

175
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.920
So there isn't much you have to know about this,

176
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.800
but it's good that you should know,

177
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.030
and nothing has changed.

178
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.630
That's up main thing.

179
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.960
So not to worry about what you need to know what you don't at sea,

180
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.590
Pam.

181
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.080
D that system off if you remember,

182
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.900
we covered that in in a lesson.

183
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:46.010
Where I the lesson where you're doing the oars hardening how to harden or secure your

184
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.550
system.

185
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.150
Um,

186
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.960
moving on Cron at job.

187
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.050
Everything is the same.

188
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.720
I'm not gonna cover every detail here because all of all of them are same.

189
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.990
Nothing changed.

190
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.020
Then.

191
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.940
We have kernel boot and hardware.

192
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.250
What has changed?

193
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.200
Um,

194
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.030
single user rescue mode.

195
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.880
Um,

196
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.640
some of these changes are with the configuration file changes shut down before we have shut

197
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.480
down just to command.

198
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.050
But now you run system CDL followed by the shutdown.

199
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.550
Same thing.

200
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.650
Everything is the same.

201
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:26.170
Same commands except now you define system CTL command preceding the actual command.

202
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:32.800
The file change we talked about this group fly location has changed the rest all same.

203
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.410
Nothing has changed then.

204
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:42.500
Software management junk install Young group installed everything on the command itself.

205
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.830
John is the same.

206
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:49.940
Except this part where they had junk group install as one word.

207
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.210
Now they have,

208
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.650
um,

209
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.920
added space between group and install.

210
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.040
Now someone would ask me a question.

211
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.310
Hey,

212
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.660
Imron,

213
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.910
why would they make these changes or why they put a space or why they make up a command

214
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.340
different?

215
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.650
Honestly,

216
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.780
this just I don't know.

217
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.560
That's the way the standard works.

218
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.720
It's just that,

219
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.020
like,

220
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.850
you could ask the question why Apple comes up with a different,

221
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.420
um,

222
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.750
look different.

223
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.650
Icahn's They just want people to embrace newer features.

224
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.400
New technology,

225
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.200
your icon.

226
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.590
So that's what pretty much it,

227
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.060
of course.

228
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.970
I also think that,

229
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.670
you know,

230
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.310
looking at the same thing again again,

231
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.080
you get bored.

232
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.440
The change is always good.

233
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.010
That's why every window,

234
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.490
every,

235
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.160
um,

236
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.910
opening system provider chain make changes like Microsoft and red Red hat slurs.

237
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.790
Anyway,

238
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.450
so on moving,

239
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.930
Let's move to the right side.

240
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.240
I'm gonna go up all the way to the top.

241
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.230
And the task is user management.

242
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.310
Nothing changed everything to create yours and delete user change.

243
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.880
Password.

244
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.150
Everything is the same.

245
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.400
So you don't have to worry about using management,

246
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.210
security and identity.

247
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.040
I'm glad nothing changed because security is something.

248
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.100
Um,

249
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.420
if you don't want to mess with If you make a mistake,

250
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:11.720
it could make your system vulnerable or create a a leak in your system.

251
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.100
Anyway,

252
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.820
nothing has changed.

253
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.450
You don't have to remember any new commands.

254
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.040
File systems.

255
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.400
Let's see.

256
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.850
Fall system volumes and discs.

257
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.960
There are few things that have changed.

258
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.820
Um,

259
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.900
in rail five and six.

260
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.470
We have file system 63 4 seven.

261
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.070
We have exit fous Every new version.

262
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.610
Have a newer,

263
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.990
faster file system now,

264
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.720
except fesses a lot faster.

265
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:43.830
I covered that in module to or module three were covered by the file system.

266
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.310
What Paula system is then,

267
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.150
some off the changes,

268
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:54.310
like port disk on the added new utility coming down to Mont file system looks the same.

269
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.200
P create creating Wally management.

270
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.520
Everything looks the same.

271
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.300
There's nothing changed on on mounting the follow system for dealing with file system.

272
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.730
Then we have no working.

273
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.420
Um I p tables is the command to enable firewall rules.

274
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.550
Now we change it to firewall that cmd firewalled as config,

275
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.020
which is a gooey This is something that we cover.

276
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.570
Um,

277
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.600
in module seven.

278
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.030
Um,

279
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:29.400
then we have to configure d c decline a few of the configuration file changed at Syria's

280
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.600
old etc.

281
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.180
Host name?

282
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.720
Where do you define your host name?

283
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.280
Same thing at sea host at sea.

284
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.380
Result a cough.

285
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.790
But now they added a new utility NMC ally con M o d.

286
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.560
I believe this command updates thes falls for you,

287
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.050
so you have to manually add them.

288
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.090
I never used it,

289
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.120
but if you want fried,

290
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.250
go ahead and use it.

291
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.070
Um,

292
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.420
configure host name at sea sis config Network.

293
00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:00.040
And now the new utility is host name CTL Recovered that while you were changing the host

294
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.430
name,

295
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:10.470
I believe in module for um I p is the new command be Have I p confected mostly recovered in

296
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.450
our training.

297
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.430
Now the newer version off rail seven has,

298
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.800
um I p command.

299
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.180
So I p configure has been deprecate id.

300
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:25.000
You could have that command if you install Net dash utility package that will allow you to

301
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.590
run if conflict but don't get used to wear Just,

302
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.090
you know,

303
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.150
be ready to use the new command,

304
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.730
which is I p configured network interface.

305
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.420
The path is the same.

306
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.130
Nothing changed.

307
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:42.160
But now you could do update or hat I peas or updates your configuration files to the

308
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.850
command and m c a lot.

309
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.040
Ah,

310
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.440
the arrest looks the same.

311
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.330
Going to resource management.

312
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.890
All these commands are the same top PSR top there few commands that it probably added.

313
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.680
Looks like t you and a tuna.

314
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.210
I really don't know what it does,

315
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.650
but I should look into it.

316
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.990
And you should,

317
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.410
too.

318
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.500
They're your thinks.

319
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.150
It's definitely something with the resource management.

320
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.360
It tells you what other resources available.

321
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.140
What are the resident?

322
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.070
Um,

323
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.120
contention?

324
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.760
On the network side,

325
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.780
there were distress.

326
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.450
Resource is so anyway,

327
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.660
view disc information,

328
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.690
d f I was stabbed.

329
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.990
We both covered that and the rest off the commands are all the same.

330
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.090
So these are the commands I wanted to cover.

331
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.990
So you should be familiar and be ready when you see new commands.

332
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.850
Don't be surprised.

333
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.090
Hey,

334
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.420
I never called that in training.

335
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.320
Hope it's their guys.

336
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.440
Try these commands out and you ready to face the challenges in actually corporate

337
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:43.980
environment.
