00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
No,

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.880
let's talk about the different type off the Lennox shells that are available to us in our

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.860
Lennox environment.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.680
When we have a Lennox machine running,

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.650
what are the different shells of he could take advantage off?

6
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.350
The 1st 1 is genome.

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.050
If you don't know what genome is,

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.770
actually,

9
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.950
genome is like a graphical environment that is in Lenox.

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.640
Now.

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.300
You must be thinking home isn't Lennox command line interface.

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.420
It is most of the time,

13
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.690
but there are people who actually installed Lennox with the gooey and the gooey while you

14
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.080
were installing the gooey.

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.550
Or while you're going through the installation,

16
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.650
you have the option to install Gui as well.

17
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.030
And the two options that you have for Gui is genome,

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450
and the 2nd 1 is K D E.

19
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.160
Both of these are the desktop gui environment,

20
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.450
and they are the shells.

21
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.310
So you log into those environment you are in the show and then you run command.

22
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.680
How you execute commands you to execute your keyboard and through your mouse you click

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.980
click,

24
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.350
click,

25
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.870
drag drop here and there.

26
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.550
That's how the interact would the operating system through that show.

27
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.480
Now,

28
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.920
of course,

29
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.630
let's go back to our main topic,

30
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.680
which is the command line chills.

31
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.250
Now the command line shows the main one is shell is just s h shell.

32
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.160
Of course,

33
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.900
this is we are now talking about when we do not have a gooey We are in a command line.

34
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.350
And now we need to use a show.

35
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.950
When you use the logs in,

36
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.740
um,

37
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.550
a user is given a shell a platform to work.

38
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.510
That platform is assigned to the user when when the user account is created.

39
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.030
So as I mentioned before,

40
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.730
if you go to Etsy past where you will see your shell So if you are let's suppose are given

41
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.600
bash shell by default and you want to switch to S H.

42
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.080
You could do that by going to a different shell.

43
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.360
How do you How can you do that?

44
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.350
We'll cover that later.

45
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.980
So show this just s H is a born show Call.

46
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.330
Sh R s H is one of the original in eggshells.

47
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.560
It is developed by UNIX computers by Stephan Born.

48
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.150
His name was actually born.

49
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.800
That's why they picked the name born chill from he worked for AT and T Bell Labs in 1977

50
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.410
Those are one of the oldest days when actually let exports or UNIX was being developed.

51
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.660
Its long history of use of means.

52
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.630
Many software developers are familiar with it.

53
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.580
It offers features such as input and output redirection shell,

54
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.880
scripting with string integer variables and condition testing and looping.

55
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.390
And so many of the things which,

56
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.800
of course,

57
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.590
don't worry about it.

58
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.250
All those the heavy words will cover them later in the lessons.

59
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.670
Then we have Bash Bash What is it now?

60
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.700
The popularity off shell which was S h was so so much that you know it made it.

61
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.030
It actually motivated programmers who actually developed the results show that was

62
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.780
compatible with it but with the several and has men.

63
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.780
They added so many things to it.

64
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.040
Lennox system still offer shell scripts They came away with bash so they still have show.

65
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.020
But now they came up bash Know what bash means?

66
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.750
It means born again shell.

67
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.270
So if the shelves still exists somewhere,

68
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.450
don't think that shell S H is gone.

69
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.640
Now the newer shell is available,

70
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.550
which is called Born again shell.

71
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.350
And in our entire course,

72
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.280
we will be using Born Again shell.

73
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.820
Why?

74
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.520
Because it has a lot of enhanced features,

75
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.760
and it is very user friendly.

76
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.590
So maney,

77
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.350
um,

78
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.750
features of variables that we could use in that show.

79
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.180
Then what out what their other shells there is.

80
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.390
Seashell and T C.

81
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.040
Shell developers have written large part of slings operating systems in C and C plus plus

82
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.840
language is right,

83
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.230
you know that using cease in Texas,

84
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.310
a model Bill Joy,

85
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.660
who was at Berkeley University,

86
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.750
developed a seashell in,

87
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.140
ah,

88
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.030
believe 1977 or 78 then the Ken Ken Greer.

89
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.610
I think that was his last name.

90
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.850
Working at Mellon University took seashell concept as a step forward,

91
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.630
and when it took several,

92
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.220
what did he do?

93
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.830
He came up to the New York show,

94
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.920
which was T.

95
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.380
C Shell and based on your system directory structure and follows.

96
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.850
T Shell does not run bash scripts.

97
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.100
Eso um,

98
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.990
if you are in a t shell and you want to run bash,

99
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.830
it's not gonna run it anyway.

100
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.660
Most of the people don't use seashell and T shells unless you really are proficient in C

101
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.750
and C plus plus programming language.

102
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.080
So my advice to you,

103
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.200
you could stay away from it.

104
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.650
If you are a beginner not to worry about these,

105
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.830
then the last one we have is corn shell or Keisha David Corn.

106
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.760
OK,

107
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.030
see,

108
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.870
that's the name.

109
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.710
So that's why the people came out with the shelves because they associate ID.

110
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.910
The name,

111
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.650
whether so the person who came up with a corn shell His name was David Corn.

112
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.130
He developed a corn shell on dumb.

113
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.350
It was about the time like T.

114
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.660
C.

115
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.370
C shell was introduced.

116
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.770
So corn shell is compatible with shell and bash l as well.

117
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.210
Now core Shal improves on boring shelled by adding floating point automatic job control and

118
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.450
so many of the things I don't want to confuse you right now.

119
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.270
Um,

120
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.750
injure UNIX environment.

121
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.400
Um,

122
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.350
most of time.

123
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.570
Corn shell is used in Solaris where,

124
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.910
as in Lenox environment most of the time,

125
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.750
a bash Ellis used,

126
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.740
as I mentioned again,

127
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.510
If you need to know the list of shells that you have installed in your system,

128
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.170
all you have to do is go into you,

129
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.850
log into your linens machine and type cat s sea shells,

130
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.250
and you will see all the list of shells.

131
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.410
So this is what I wanted to cover,

132
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.220
and I want you to be aware these are the different type of shells.

133
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.530
If you are creating a shell script and you need to get help on creating a shelves,

134
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.030
let's say,

135
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.810
if you google it,

136
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.520
maybe you will find some off the information or some of the US ah,

137
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.960
scripting syntax in bash and some off them in corn shell.

138
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.480
So you have to be very careful.

139
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.380
They're probably not gonna work on one another.

140
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.250
That's why you need to know the difference off different shells.
