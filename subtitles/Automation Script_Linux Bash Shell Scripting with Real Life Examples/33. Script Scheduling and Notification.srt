1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
script schedules and notifications.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,430
Now we have a few scripts that Realogy rondos are useful.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,250
Valuable script.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,050
Now we need to schedule them.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,130
And how do we need to schedule them?

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,350
You schedule them through the Cron job.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,020
Cron job is a process and automated service.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,860
Um,

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:29,250
in Lenox are in UNIX flavours that you could specify scripts to run at a certain time.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,280
And then we could notify the users or administrators engineers through the email that this

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,050
script ran and they heard the out descript.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,870
So this is something that you,

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,480
um,

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,090
probably already been doing or you might have to do when you are in corporate environment.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,850
When you create shell script,

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,160
then you need to make it more automated.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,190
What I mean is more automated.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,910
Meaning you automated a script to perform certain task.

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,610
Right now,

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,090
you go one step further,

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,750
which is to schedule it so you don't have to run it yourself.

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,930
Okay,

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,650
That's a second step off.

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,910
Automation.

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,950
The third step of automation is that you once it runs it,

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,420
what he wanted to do Well,

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,570
you wanted to either have a file created or do something or you could just described Could

28
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,430
just notify or Cron job could just notify the system administrator.

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,670
So this is Ah,

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,030
a few steps that we will take.

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,050
We will use this.

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,350
Ah,

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,820
this lessons based on our previous created scripts.

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,850
So I log in to my Lennix machine right here,

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,540
and I am logged in as myself And which directory?

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,680
Um,

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,250
in I'm in my professional scripts directory.

38
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,780
And the script that I will use to schedule is ah Ping script.

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,380
Also,

40
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,450
when you run the script,

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,050
it actually ping Yeah,

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,250
an I p address.

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,660
That is pinky belittle.

44
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,450
Say okay.

45
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,330
If it's not thinkable will say it's not OK now you could run the script and view that

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,330
result on the screen.

47
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:05,590
Right?

48
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,080
But if you want to schedule,

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,060
it does it will run itself and it notify you.

50
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,450
You have to specify that front,

51
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,140
um,

52
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,980
in the Cron job.

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,480
So first,

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,950
make sure you have the complete path.

55
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,950
Um ps ping script Look.

56
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,680
So this is a complete path.

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,630
Copy it.

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,950
So you don't make any mistake while you are creating a Cron job.

59
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,450
No type craun before you type Cron type dates.

60
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,880
So you would know what time you want to run at this time.

61
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,120
It is 2031.

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,730
Um,

63
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,250
I will schedule it for 20 um 2034 for exam.

64
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,440
So if I do,

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,750
Kron Tab minus e is to edit.

66
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:01,550
So the first field off Cron and I'm sure you are familiar with it is the minute.

67
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:08,830
So I want to pick the minute 34 And the hour is 20 and the day of the month.

68
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,530
Arana running every day,

69
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,750
month of the year,

70
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,450
every year and day of the week every day of the week.

71
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,050
And now the command so hit right and it will paste.

72
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,880
You're so it will paste it Now how do you know it ran?

73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,790
You could just output to ah script.

74
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,850
Um Ping,

75
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:41,210
I'll put So this is the output from the from the script that will run And the reason I'm

76
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:46,850
putting paying dash up with said this way you wouldn't know that Describe did run.

77
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:54,580
So let's save Cron 2034 deaths.

78
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,450
The time will run.

79
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,350
What time is it right now?

80
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,250
2032

81
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,550
So we actually have to wait.

82
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,020
What?

83
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:09,700
One minute and now is 2033 So in one minute scribbled Rana.

84
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,550
So you will see.

85
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,920
We have,

86
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,550
Ah,

87
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,480
a file name called Output Dash Air.

88
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,950
So don't confuse with this one.

89
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,950
The file that will come in ever will be output.

90
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,090
Um,

91
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,700
was it Tab Dash?

92
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,150
Oh,

93
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,950
put,

94
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,350
um,

95
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,160
ping dash upwards.

96
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,750
So this is the file that was spit up my script and ah,

97
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,020
a friend.

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,150
Variables are specified.

99
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,640
Now,

100
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,670
as we wait for the script to run,

101
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,740
the next thing that I will cover is about the notification.

102
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,040
Now,

103
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,480
how do we notify?

104
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,830
Ah,

105
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,700
user through the email?

106
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,110
Well,

107
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,290
you could actually take that file that will be created,

108
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,690
which is paying dash output you could create.

109
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,850
You could take that file and send it to them.

110
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,860
The user,

111
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,370
right.

112
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,060
You could do that.

113
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,840
But then you have to cad the file and send it.

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,850
But how about we just simply,

115
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,800
instead of going into Ping Dash,

116
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,590
a profile will just specify the the name.

117
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,690
Oh,

118
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:11,960
sorry.

119
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,710
The email,

120
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,300
An address off the use that is going to.

121
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,730
So that's what that's what we will do on the second step.

122
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,920
So let's check again.

123
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,470
What time is it?

124
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,200
Right now it's 2034.

125
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
So the script has already ran.

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,050
Let's confirm,

127
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,050
and hmm.

128
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,450
It did not help.

129
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:42,180
Output is ping up.

130
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,650
Put thing,

131
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,210
huh?

132
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,850
Where did I think it's probably,

133
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,050
um,

134
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,000
putting it into my home directory.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's probably it's a at minus.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,760
L whom I have so hang output.

137
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,020
Yes.

138
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,310
See,

139
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:12,090
that's what if I wanted to have this output file to be in the exact same location where I

140
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:12,480
want,

141
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,470
where my scriptures.

142
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,960
Then I have to specify the full path,

143
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,130
the absolute path.

144
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,110
But since I did not specify it by default,

145
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,070
it will put in to the Users Home Directory,

146
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,140
which is home.

147
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,680
I have salt.

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,050
So now,

149
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,100
anyway,

150
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,150
let's go one step back.

151
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,060
This is my home directory.

152
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,080
Let's check and at the oil thing dish.

153
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,980
And you see it is there when I want it to one.

154
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,420
That one is okay and is not okay anyway.

155
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,070
So that's how you could schedule your scripts.

156
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,410
And it becomes so much easier when you actually rely on Cron tabs.

157
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,050
Now,

158
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,920
next one is the notification.

159
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,620
As I said,

160
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,070
you could cat out the file and send it over to the another Cron.

161
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,410
But why?

162
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,780
You wanted to do another cross.

163
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,950
So what you do is you go back to your Cron tab minus e.

164
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,850
And now,

165
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,630
instead of running it to ping output,

166
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,550
what you could do is you pipe it and do Male minus s for subject.

167
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,450
Um,

168
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,800
connective ity status.

169
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,550
This is this is going to a subject.

170
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,960
And where is it going?

171
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,550
It's going to my email,

172
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,450
and that's pretty much it.

173
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,380
So if I schedule this for,

174
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,650
ah time,

175
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,430
that is right now or two minutes from now it will run.

176
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,650
But it is not going to email me.

177
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:38,960
Why?

178
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,030
Because the email Relais server is not configured in my server.

179
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,780
So if you already have email configured in your Lennox machine and it is able to send out e

180
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,380
mails outside off your environment,

181
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,480
then it will work.

182
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,100
Definitely work.

183
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,290
But in my case,

184
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,550
it's not going to work.

185
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,240
