00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.110
disabled in active users.

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.860
This is Ah,

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.490
another lesson where,

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.350
um the security comes in.

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.460
And,

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.920
um,

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.130
not like actual security.

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.380
I mean,

9
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.720
the security concerns you are that this the users who are not logged into the system for a

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.050
certain number off days should be next.

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.890
Um,

12
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.860
so we will run the command in this lesson toe,

13
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.200
identify those users,

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.880
And how does it work in a real world?

15
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.510
Well,

16
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.320
it happened to me many people,

17
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.240
and I'm sure might have happened to you,

18
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.650
too,

19
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.900
that your boss comes to you and says,

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.160
Hey,

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.930
give me a list Of all the users who haven't been logging for the past three months or a

22
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.250
year,

23
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.280
well,

24
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.930
you could do two things with This is one who pre people who are already working in your

25
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.320
environment and and they just don't have the need to log in anymore.

26
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.560
So you want to go and and to leave their account.

27
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.720
That's why second reason people who have left the company and somehow you missed Ah,

28
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.340
one of the servers are a few servers where you forgot to delete user account off that

29
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.550
person who left the company.

30
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.410
So of course,

31
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.630
it's a security concern,

32
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.940
right?

33
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.450
If the user account is still there,

34
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.150
well,

35
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.520
mistakes do happen.

36
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.750
And you do forget to the lead user account on certain number of servers.

37
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.950
Actually,

38
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.870
if you have 1000 servers and forget about it.

39
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.960
So what do you need to do?

40
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.450
You have to implement some kind of automation tools that will run,

41
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.250
Um,

42
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.330
like after 90 days or after year,

43
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.910
or whatever the number off days you wanted to run ritual,

44
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.050
pick up all these users that haven't been logged into the system,

45
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.600
and it will simply disabled you.

46
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.920
Go sit leader if you want to.

47
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.020
But the better disabled.

48
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.840
So this is what we're gonna do in this lesson.

49
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.060
Well,

50
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.350
first identify the users.

51
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.950
Then we will create a scrip.

52
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.670
We'll create two type of script.

53
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.270
One script is Four Loops Script,

54
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.250
which will look for all the users and disabled the inactive account.

55
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.490
That there's the second script.

56
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.190
Double create is will be exactly same script,

57
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.050
but we will use X argument demand,

58
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.410
which is a newer commander.

59
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.950
I'll show you that could be used in scripting language to take the input from the command

60
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.550
and execute.

61
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.560
You know,

62
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.250
another command on So that's how we will do.

63
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.230
Ah,

64
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.610
and so let's ah,

65
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.760
log into our machine,

66
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.910
our legs machine.

67
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.800
No.

68
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.150
Again,

69
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.810
As I said,

70
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.360
um,

71
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.900
I have created these scripts for you already to say time.

72
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.070
So the script that I first created as let's V I.

73
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.620
That script and I name it disabled users four four.

74
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.970
Meaning,

75
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.050
is this a script I did for four?

76
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.900
What it does is,

77
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.470
of course,

78
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.520
to find the variable and all the or third a description,

79
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.250
modified comments.

80
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.110
Then it's gonna run.

81
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:33.430
This command last logged till correct AUC these few commands to identify those users.

82
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.610
Now,

83
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.450
why am I picking these good question.

84
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.380
First of all,

85
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.540
last log is the command which will give you all the list of users have been logged.

86
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.470
You could use last as well as last log,

87
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.650
but last log is much efficient for this purpose.

88
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:57.340
Then till dash minus two day tail minus and plus two meaning get rid of the first line off

89
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.820
the up,

90
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.860
which I'll show you in a minute.

91
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.650
What is the first line?

92
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.810
So if I open up a duplicate session,

93
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:26.830
that's log in as root and if I run last log you will see hopes as do more you see at the

94
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.150
top.

95
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.220
This is a line that comes up that you don't want to get.

96
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.210
So that's why I'm using the option.

97
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:49.870
Last long tail minus and plus two to minus end less to and just doom or again.

98
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.450
And you will see that first line that was showing up is not showing up again.

99
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.160
So that's why I'm using No,

100
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.350
that,

101
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.280
uh,

102
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.750
minus and plus two,

103
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.560
then next one is group test zero.

104
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.970
So now,

105
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.200
if you wanted to disable those accounts that haven't been logged into the system for 90

106
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.560
days,

107
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.450
then you have to use the command.

108
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.690
Um,

109
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.780
I believe it's ah,

110
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.850
last log minus B 90.

111
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.960
So this will give you all the uses that haven't been logged into the system for the last 90

112
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.320
days up.

113
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.780
Sorry.

114
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.720
I have to remove the piper eso these other uses that had never haven't been logged in.

115
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.600
So now you also notice that they are There are other users that are systems users like

116
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.540
route or male operator games or nobody or FTP.

117
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.860
You don't want to get rid off or disable these accounts,

118
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.650
so you would have to actually make sure that you put some kind of grew up inside that,

119
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.250
uh,

120
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.950
we're moving,

121
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.950
filtering out some off them and or you could just,

122
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.350
um,

123
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.100
run this command and grip it against all the users in etc.

124
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.950
Password file.

125
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:10.370
And you could actually do for either people who have home directory or group minus B for

126
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.530
those who actually have the user like no log.

127
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.250
And so let's see if you do cat see password.

128
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.500
You see,

129
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.350
all the users that our system users are have no log in and user that actually created

130
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.420
encounter in law again.

131
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.040
Have this sash home directly with it.

132
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.130
So you could specify different options,

133
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.640
different grub commands to get rid of those.

134
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.610
But anyway,

135
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.450
let's ah,

136
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.220
let's go back to our command.

137
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.560
This is a command that will give you all the uses that been never logged in or have not

138
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.150
been logging for 90 days.

139
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.550
So for my test purposes,

140
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.310
this lab I created a script,

141
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.850
um,

142
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.590
cat disabled user for so this script,

143
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.960
what it will do is it will actually do the same thing last law.

144
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.790
But instead of minus B 90 because this again,

145
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.950
this is a test to show you how to delete the system and how to create a scrip I just

146
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.550
removed minus B minus 90.

147
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.630
Uh,

148
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.720
kept the till till command.

149
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.650
And now I'm groping for only test.

150
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.630
Ah,

151
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.920
why I'm graphical Because I do have a test account in there that I'll show you in this

152
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.550
exercise.

153
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.950
It's ironic,

154
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.130
Will.

155
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.430
See,

156
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.350
I have two tests account so this command will grapple the used to test account and then it

157
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.670
will use the command.

158
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.050
Use Ahmad minus l two disabled account.

159
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.450
So let's v I this script again.

160
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.930
And here,

161
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.290
If you want to specify,

162
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:50.430
let's say if you want to grab minus B sorry with minus a not not a a C minus VfB and you

163
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.070
are to exclude.

164
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.610
Never you could do that and then print out all those user.

165
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.130
But since we're doing the test,

166
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:03.850
only who will pick the test once and now you'll see this is going to disable all the test

167
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.130
the old accounts that matches test.

168
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.050
So instead of doing for,

169
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.050
uh,

170
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.560
so for now,

171
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.820
I will use the four command for in the variable dollar A,

172
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.050
which is getting from here,

173
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.850
is putting in the variable A it's doing use Ahmad,

174
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.740
and minus l option is to disable the list and done so instead of just for test.

175
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.450
I will do,

176
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:37.250
um cat dollar I for now,

177
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.950
and Allah is put,

178
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:44.250
but ah,

179
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.050
comment here.

180
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.720
So I don't want to delete it right now,

181
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.350
so I will just check What are those users?

182
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.950
Let's run it.

183
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.840
Four obsesses.

184
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.350
No such father directory.

185
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.590
What happened?

186
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.650
Let's take a look.

187
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.050
Four.

188
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.050
Um,

189
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:11.920
last logged.

190
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.390
This is what it's giving us the entire list of fuses and then we're doing is we're putting

191
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:26.160
this list for I in into the eye and then Oh,

192
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.140
we not care.

193
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.720
You don't have to care.

194
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:36.550
We have to echo just to see what are those?

195
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:43.350
Clear the screen.

196
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.250
Disabled uses for Luke.

197
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.140
Okay,

198
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.650
so here's a list of all these users that have not been logged in,

199
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.950
but it's still not correct because I just wanted to grope test.

200
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.250
Right.

201
00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:03.040
Let's take a look at the disabled account for and I want to all I did the minus V to

202
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.730
exclude.

203
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.050
I don't want to exclude.

204
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.820
I want to grab only those because,

205
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.680
as it said again,

206
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.650
this is just for test.

207
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.830
Now let's see and you run.

208
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.990
It gives me only those users.

209
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.170
So now I have identified these other uses of you want to disable,

210
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.150
Go in and,

211
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.270
um,

212
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.350
disabled user for script.

213
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.620
And this time I will.

214
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.450
Instead of echo,

215
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.690
I will get rid of that line,

216
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.550
put user mode myself and whatever the user returns disabled.

217
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.850
Perfect.

218
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.160
Before I run this script,

219
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.920
I will verify it that I could log in with the use it is going to disable.

220
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:56.110
It was going to disable test 123 and I'm logging in and you will see it has logged in

221
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.990
Perfect.

222
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.150
So now I could get rid off this,

223
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.550
and now I'll run my scrip.

224
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.950
The script ran.

225
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.000
Now let's say now it should have disabled those accounts.

226
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.800
Let's say if I log back in test 123 in the password and there you go.

227
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.810
So it's not gonna let me get in.

228
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.150
It's his access denied.

229
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.050
I know it has disabled those accounts.

230
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.070
And to verify it,

231
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:30.330
you'll see you could do grip test one just or just test.

232
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.040
And at sea,

233
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.500
Shadow Shadow is the one that actually puts the exclamation point right here that would

234
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:42.250
tell that this account should be deceived to be right here If I just modified,

235
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:42.580
etc.

236
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:48.650
Shadow fall and look for test.

237
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:55.050
I could remove this exclamation point and I'll sort of more exclamation point here.

238
00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:01.770
So now I should be able to log back in and tow Log back in my comm,

239
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:08.350
my user is test 123 and password and bingo.

240
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.200
A lot Exit out again.

241
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.350
Run again from the command again and it should have logged.

242
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.550
Locked the count.

243
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:25.110
Try again and it's not letting me in excess and perfect.

244
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.870
The script works.

245
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.770
So now this is the one way to a disabled user account using a for loop.

246
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.750
Another script I wanted to show you to do the same thing is,

247
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:40.450
um SV Eyes I have created a script for you guys already is ex argument script.

248
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.420
So what is going to do is in Skinner,

249
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:50.610
instead of specifying the variable and then running the four loop and then going through

250
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.450
the whole process,

251
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.690
it's gonna run that script right here,

252
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.970
do everything growth for test and AUC those.

253
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.220
And instead of that putting into a variable,

254
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.080
I am actually passing that too.

255
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.270
As an argument,

256
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.490
I put an X argument and minus I option curly braces,

257
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.050
meaning Whatever comes in as a result from this command,

258
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.450
do use Ahmad lock these account.

259
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.250
It's just that simple.

260
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.460
In so doing the four loop command,

261
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.150
you can also specify what you wanted to do with exact same line in one command.

262
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.950
So let's try it.

263
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.400
Let's try to run it.

264
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.450
But before we run it,

265
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.570
um,

266
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.360
we already have disabled those,

267
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.450
um um,

268
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.690
account.

269
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.810
So I'm gonna enable them again by going to see Shadow,

270
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:51.950
look for test accounts and get rid off exclamation point exclamation point and save.

271
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.120
Now,

272
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.650
when I run this disabled ex argument,

273
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:05.730
it should have disabled those I could verify by doing Grab test on Etsy Shadow and you will

274
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.750
see it has put that exclamation point.

275
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.300
It's doing the same thing as four Luke doing,

276
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.470
but it's a different way,

277
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.400
so I have to descriptors that you need to learn one as cat Oh,

278
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.650
sorry,

279
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.750
one as disabled for,

280
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.950
and the 2nd 1 is disabled arguments.

281
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.350
So both doing the same thing as you see again.

282
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.740
If you wanted to do the test with me,

283
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:35.620
you would have to create test account before using this before doing this exercise.

284
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.750
Um,

285
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:44.550
I actually I will actually add that to my video at the beginning by editing it.

286
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.660
But anyway,

287
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.440
if you if you if you are listening to the message you know already that this mess,

288
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.550
this lesson has been edited for you to create account first,

289
00:14:54.550 --> 00:15:01.550
which are test 123 or test 345 or whichever account that you wanted to Ah,

290
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.250
you want to disable and do your lab for
