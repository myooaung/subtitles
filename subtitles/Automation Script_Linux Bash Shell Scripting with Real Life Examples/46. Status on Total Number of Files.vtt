00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
OK,

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.230
moving on to the next lesson.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.230
Now we have status on the total number of files.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.490
So basically,

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.880
we're gonna have a script that will send alert if files are less than 50 or whatever the

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.520
defined number of balls.

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.550
So this type of scripts are often used incorporating Wyman when an application generates a

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.650
few number of files.

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.950
And for the developers or Ewan system administrators,

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.610
they have to make sure those fall are there before they actually go and run another

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.150
workflow.

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.850
So if the number of files are 20 go ahead,

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.160
run the workflow.

14
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.540
If it's 19 the workplace not complete its waiting pending.

15
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.470
And then once it's complete Nordic parts of these type off workflow our entire process 10

16
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.940
from one to another.

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.220
So this is what we cover.

18
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.430
What?

19
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.060
What we will run here is simply we will run Ellis command my cell option because it will

20
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.390
give the listing the different options.

21
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.830
If you want to like ls lt are,

22
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.850
or just tea or any of the option that will give you the entire listing off your directory.

23
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.220
Then we will create a script to perform that comparison and,

24
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.690
of course,

25
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.140
at the end schedule and notify if you have to schedule it through the Cron job and notify

26
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.980
through the email.

27
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.650
So that's a two main ah way to schedule a job and to notify users to the email.

28
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.590
So let's go into our main lab,

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.450
the next machine I have already logged in as myself.

30
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480
I am in home directory.

31
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.550
Let's go to PS,

32
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.550
Derek Tree and I will create the script real quick.

33
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.330
Eso Let's call the script.

34
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.850
Um,

35
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.540
you know what?

36
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.860
Before we call the script,

37
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.750
So let's create far so that he could run that script against those files.

38
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.800
So,

39
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.370
uh,

40
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.910
to create the fall I will create instead of 50.

41
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.650
All create 20.

42
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.250
It's a touch file.

43
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.400
Um,

44
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.620
and of course,

45
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.020
um,

46
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.070
I wanted to have one through 20 and let's call it dot text.

47
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.450
So I want to create files for 1 to 20.

48
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.990
The ends with Texas hit enter and you will see I have files from file one all the way

49
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.950
through to 20 and as the text file.

50
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.350
So my scrip,

51
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.360
what it will do is whenever it runs,

52
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.170
it will verify if he have total number 20 files in my home directory And if it does,

53
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.300
then it will notify the user.

54
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.580
Hey,

55
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.790
I got the 20 files.

56
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.040
Go ahead and start your workflow eso to verified.

57
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.870
You do ls minus.

58
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.350
L command and do file and asterisk.

59
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.880
And you will get all the 20 files.

60
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.100
But now we have to do wc minus.

61
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.450
L to check the count.

62
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.750
Count is 20.

63
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.690
Perfect.

64
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.950
Now let me put that script and little command this one in our script.

65
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.210
It's a small,

66
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.900
tiny script and we will run that script.

67
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050
So ah,

68
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.840
count files.

69
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.850
This is a name I want to give my scrip,

70
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:25.830
and you're defining all our parameters up there.

71
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.350
All our settings author,

72
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.350
the date description.

73
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.270
One of the most important one.

74
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.550
This group will,

75
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.250
um,

76
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:52.550
verify total number fun modified.

77
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.970
By the way,

78
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.430
You could also add any of the comments you want that will actually make you,

79
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.960
um,

80
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.540
understand what descript is for.

81
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.850
You could also give comments on every lime and ever you write some.

82
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.030
So let's say if you are defining a variable,

83
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.630
I'm going to define their variable here.

84
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.830
A cool take ls minus.

85
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.310
L file.

86
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.960
Asteroid W c My cell stick close.

87
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.060
So I have defined variable A.

88
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.050
So I could put a comment here if you want to comment,

89
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.050
defining variable.

90
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.050
Okay,

91
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.050
that's it.

92
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.750
If you want to actually do,

93
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.250
um,

94
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.400
if you want to actually add comments in every line,

95
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.430
so are variable is defined.

96
00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:03.870
So what we'll have to do is if dollar A is equal 2 20 now using e que because usually

97
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.950
integer and you remember when we use equal equal sign,

98
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:16.180
which is equal equal when we actually using the letters.

99
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.980
If you are putting why or no?

100
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:26.150
Then if a is equal 20 then echo.

101
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.650
Yes,

102
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:43.740
there are dollar A files meaning 25 else go miles are less than 20 because now be defining

103
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.740
.

104
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.330
It actually number what we're looking for,

105
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.450
so we cannot are very variable.

106
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.550
See,

107
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.840
that's pretty much it's that simple.

108
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.830
Let's put if here,

109
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.550
so come in life.

110
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:07.910
So let's give it executed permission count files and let's run it.

111
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.710
It says Yes,

112
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.750
there are 20 files that as perfect.

113
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.620
No.

114
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.350
What do you have to do?

115
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.150
I could show you real quick if,

116
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.390
first of all,

117
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.700
before I show you something else,

118
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.450
let's change it.

119
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.970
Let's delete one part.

120
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.950
So one room or file?

121
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.550
Um 20.

122
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.420
No.

123
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.050
When I run it,

124
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.950
it will tell me Count Falls Files are less than Okay.

125
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.690
So now we know that.

126
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.230
Ah,

127
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.850
the script works.

128
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.550
Here's another quick thing I wanted to show you.

129
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.350
You see,

130
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.890
right here we always defined variable here,

131
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.150
Right?

132
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.650
And variable is a equal.

133
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.950
Whatever the variable is,

134
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.590
What you could also do here is instead of just defining variable,

135
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.150
you could also actually put this entire,

136
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.540
um um command here so you could do,

137
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.750
like,

138
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.950
take.

139
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:20.460
If this command quit,

140
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.020
it comes out.

141
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.750
It is cual to 20.

142
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.990
Then do that.

143
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.850
And then you don't have to define the various.

144
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.050
You're just common dot Up seafood runs.

145
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.850
Yes.

146
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.510
Bars are less than 20.

147
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.050
If I create back the,

148
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.960
uh,

149
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.290
flow's touch my remote while Juanita txt.

150
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.450
And now when I run it?

151
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.110
Yes,

152
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.750
there are.

153
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.350
Ah,

154
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.030
there are files.

155
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.320
Yes,

156
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.000
there are falls.

157
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.490
Which one is?

158
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.860
Oh,

159
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.320
remember,

160
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.520
we have that variable in there.

161
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.450
That's why it couldn't.

162
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.110
Ah,

163
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.650
right here.

164
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.500
Yes,

165
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.150
there are.

166
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.750
And it doesn't understand what that variable is because we are commented out the variable.

167
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.080
So we could say yes,

168
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.050
there are 20.

169
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.330
Anyway,

170
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.910
my point here is to explain you that you could define variable,

171
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.180
which is the best way and cleanest way to put your script together.

172
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.290
So you would know where to use your very if you do not want to use variable,

173
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:23.350
you could also put that entire command inside all l state.

174
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.650
So that's how this works.

175
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.630
And once that is completed,

176
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:34.250
you go also send a message return status to another workflow.

177
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.400
Hey,

178
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.550
the command ran success.
