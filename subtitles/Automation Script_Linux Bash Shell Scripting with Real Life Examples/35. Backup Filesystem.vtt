00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
Okay,

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.250
so now in this lesson,

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.650
we are going to write a scrip that will back up our file system.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.850
Very important script.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.120
Um,

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.870
if you do not have,

7
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.240
ah,

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.450
back up product or backup application or backup solution in your environment.

9
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.430
Um,

10
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.360
most of the time.

11
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.050
Ah,

12
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.530
smaller companies do not have,

13
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.950
um,

14
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.200
the backup third party application that does the backup for them.

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.240
So what do they have to do is they have to rely on this operating system tools that are

16
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.150
available to do the backup and run those backers manually by creating little script?

17
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.390
If you're in a bigger company,

18
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.450
you have a backup.

19
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.950
Perfect.

20
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.040
Um,

21
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.540
you probably don't have to worry about it,

22
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.440
but I would still say that sometimes you do have to tar ah,

23
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.940
file to do the backup.

24
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.460
If you are making certain changes for certain times.

25
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.110
Anyway,

26
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.340
um,

27
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.450
let's go into the lesson.

28
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.120
And in this lesson,

29
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.810
we are going to back up r slash,

30
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.350
etc.

31
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.350
And war directories using the Tar Command.

32
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.400
Okay,

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.590
why am I picking slash at sea and war directories two reasons.

34
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.150
One,

35
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.420
These are the most important directories in Olynyk system environment,

36
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.980
which is less,

37
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.640
etc.

38
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.800
that has all the configuration files and war that has all your Apache and logging

39
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.460
information.

40
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.130
If you need to go back and troubleshoot same thing if you need to go back if something has

41
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.820
changed in your etc.

42
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.550
Directory configuration has gene in your application has stopped working.

43
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.990
You could go back and restored from your backed up etc.

44
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.480
Directory.

45
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.250
That's one reason second reason is I'm just picking these up.

46
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.380
You could actually pick up any directory that you want for your test purposes.

47
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.700
So I am picking these up as just for my lesson to go,

48
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.870
where to make you understand.

49
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.180
So we'll create the backup of these two directories was using the command tar.

50
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.710
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

51
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.030
Then what we're gonna do is we're gonna compress the backup file,

52
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.610
which is the tar file now using the Jesus command.

53
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.650
So compress is actually going to reduce the size off the tar file.

54
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.860
Then we're going to do,

55
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.310
Of course.

56
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.160
Then we're going to write a script to automate the entire process,

57
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.110
and we're gonna put some logic.

58
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.740
Some intelligence inside of the scrip that will look for the backup file first before is

59
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.420
actually.

60
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.170
Ah,

61
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.200
move it somewhere,

62
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.120
send it to someone,

63
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.950
or send an email that the back of his complete or anything.

64
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.250
So we will put that logic in there.

65
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.060
So let's,

66
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.450
um,

67
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.150
go into a winning machine.

68
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.330
Um,

69
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.130
I have logged in again as myself and which directory I'm in.

70
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.570
I'm in my home directory now,

71
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.620
since we are going to back up had that sash at Sea and War Directory.

72
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.860
These are the directories that are owned by route.

73
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.270
So me being being myself,

74
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.370
I don't have permissions to do the ah,

75
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.790
backups or touch,

76
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.720
even touch those records.

77
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.650
What do I have to do is I have to become route perfect.

78
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.850
Who am I?

79
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.490
You confirm that I am route now?

80
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.460
I'm very powerful.

81
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.900
I could do anything I want.

82
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.800
So the command,

83
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.750
first of all,

84
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.670
we always before you write a script,

85
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.380
always run your command to make sure that command works.

86
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.650
Before you actually put that command inside of his script.

87
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.430
So I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna do.

88
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.570
Tar C v F.

89
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.950
It's just the option for the tar to actually put everything off.

90
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.930
Um,

91
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.670
that's the etc.

92
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.310
Or tar.

93
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.460
And then you have to specify the name off the destination file,

94
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:04.250
which is back up dot backup dot tar and what are be backing up your backing up at sea and

95
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.750
slash war.

96
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.080
So that's simple command to tar both of these directories and put them into backup Tar Tar

97
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.470
file,

98
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.350
which will go into slash temp directory.

99
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.450
Let's run it.

100
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.190
As you could see,

101
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.180
it's coming up with all those files and it looks perfect.

102
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.550
It actually taking every file and at sea and every file or directory in war and tarring it

103
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.150
together in a tar ball.

104
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.740
And it'll put in to the file that we have specified,

105
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.350
which is back up tour.

106
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.230
Okay,

107
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.650
so it should be done.

108
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.980
Ah,

109
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.700
pretty soon.

110
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.050
My system is small.

111
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.630
It's not huge.

112
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:54.990
But if your system that you're working on as pretty big and has gigs of gigs off ah so file

113
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.670
system petition in etc.

114
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.350
And war,

115
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.150
then it's probably gonna take low longer.

116
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.160
Anyway,

117
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.700
we'll give it a,

118
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.150
um,

119
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.670
a few seconds.

120
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.470
Other go see.

121
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.150
It's done as a matter off conversation that I was having with you,

122
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.650
and it's done.

123
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.920
Now let's verify it.

124
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:20.480
If it actually has created the file in where we defined the location temp right and the

125
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.660
father was back up.

126
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.150
I had TAB and it automatically completed because it knows there's a file their hit enter,

127
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150
and now you'll see the date.

128
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.550
The time the file was created and it is their perfect It has everything.

129
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.910
Now,

130
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.470
if you wanted to view what's inside the file,

131
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.620
you could view that by untiring it.

132
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.130
Or you could use the option tar T V F,

133
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.700
which will not untie or a bill.

134
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.840
It'll just show you what's inside anyway.

135
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.240
Our focus is not the tar or compress command.

136
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.470
Our focus is to write a script that will run those commands,

137
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.840
right.

138
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.150
So now we know that it works.

139
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:06.450
Next thing we have to do is we have to compress it so G zip attempt back.

140
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:14.640
You see the size off my slash at cease and slash war is this much,

141
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.750
and when I do that Jesus,

142
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.250
it will reduce the size.

143
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.770
Um,

144
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.440
most likely,

145
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.750
it should bring it down to about half off its size,

146
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.410
and once it's completed,

147
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:40.310
it will actually change extension from backup dot tar to back up the tar dot G zip and Of

148
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.680
course,

149
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.350
it will have a lot smaller size.

150
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.050
I come hopefully should be done soon.

151
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.420
If you are doing with me while I am teaching you,

152
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:57.250
that would be great exercise to actually toria walls and to compress your fault.

153
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.590
By the way,

154
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.620
if it is taking a really long time,

155
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.550
you could actually open up another terminal.

156
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.550
I'll show you This is a good exercise as well.

157
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.890
Log in the stem.

158
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.250
Log in as root because you're running his route.

159
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:34.950
I can now go to Temp directory and do ls minus lt or on backup asterisk.

160
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.860
And you will see both files.

161
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.140
One is back of dark tar and the other one's backup dot r dot gz Now,

162
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.140
since we are command is still running,

163
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.250
it means this size is going to change.

164
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.250
If I run that command again,

165
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.460
you see,

166
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.050
it's keep reducing.

167
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.450
Keep shrinking the file.

168
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.390
Okay.

169
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.850
Anyway,

170
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.620
um,

171
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.130
if you look at the back window,

172
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.750
you will see the Commander's finished successfully,

173
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.880
and the both of our commands that we want to include in our script ran successfully.

174
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.820
And even if the script will run it,

175
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.350
we know it's not gonna ever out or it's not gonna complain.

176
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.250
Now,

177
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.850
the time to actually create,

178
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.950
um,

179
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.750
our backup script.

180
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.350
So we'll call it back up.

181
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.550
Um,

182
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.050
file system.

183
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.320
Um,

184
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.440
you could pick any name you want.

185
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:31.930
Of course.

186
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.320
Hit.

187
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.650
Enter.

188
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.150
Now you have to specify the show.

189
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.040
Been bash,

190
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.050
um,

191
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.730
again.

192
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.110
Who is the author on the other?

193
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.820
In your case,

194
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.650
you're the out there.

195
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.780
Okay.

196
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:50.040
Date 080 a to 20.

197
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.310
Why am I picking 0808 all the time?

198
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.130
This is something.

199
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.450
Ah,

200
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.120
someone sport.

201
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.750
There's it.

202
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.950
Something important.

203
00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.850
No,

204
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.180
this is something I'm This is stuck in my mind.

205
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.160
I keep on picking on there anyway.

206
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.750
Description is back up,

207
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.950
slash etc.

208
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.750
And sash war files.

209
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.290
That's description important.

210
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.710
Modified.

211
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.400
It's the first time,

212
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.150
so we'll leave the same day.

213
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.920
All right,

214
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.180
now we have to put the same commander.

215
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.820
He created Iran,

216
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:43.250
which is to tar cbf him back up Qatar at sea sesh war.

217
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.510
Then what you're gonna do,

218
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.460
we gonna compress it.

219
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.010
Jesus,

220
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.650
Back up,

221
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.350
Dr.

222
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.000
Right now you're probably thinking Hey,

223
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.380
Imron.

224
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.630
Ah,

225
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.050
maybe when it runs the script runs all the time it runs.

226
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:03.460
It does the back of that tar file and the file or exists is gonna all right.

227
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.250
The older file,

228
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.600
right?

229
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.000
Yes,

230
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.460
you are right.

231
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.550
It will overwrite if you want to have.

232
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.630
Ah,

233
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.590
different name every time it creates that.

234
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.450
You could do that by specifying dot Um,

235
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.450
the date variable.

236
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.440
Um,

237
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.160
again,

238
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.390
I'm not gonna go into it.

239
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.760
It's gonna get very longer.

240
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.750
But you could You could definitely do that.

241
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.750
No,

242
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.720
Get into our backups.

243
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.050
Now.

244
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:35.740
The first thing I have to do is find back up dot tar dot gz before it's actually going to

245
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.950
run the script.

246
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.040
I have to actually Sorry.

247
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.660
When it runs a script and creates it,

248
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.740
I have to do something with that.

249
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.000
I have to notify the system administrator,

250
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.830
or I have to actually copy that back up and put it somewhere.

251
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.850
So in case if this system were the server I'm working on,

252
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.150
if it actually crashes,

253
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.560
then I could actually recover from another server.

254
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.480
So it's always a good idea to trash for them.

255
00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.690
You.

256
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.450
So this is the time I'm actually doing that third step.

257
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.520
So before I do the third step,

258
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.450
I have to verify if that actually filed that I'm going to trash for exist.

259
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:19.670
So And that would be I'm saying that Find backup dot org EMS m time and if it exists,

260
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.480
minus one.

261
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.450
Meaning if it if it was created to date,

262
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.920
not yesterday.

263
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:40.550
I don't want to send the yesterday's backup dot file type if print and then an percent Deb

264
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.550
.

265
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.800
No,

266
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.720
basically,

267
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.330
I'm saying,

268
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.870
if it is exist m time,

269
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.140
this which is the type,

270
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.740
is the file simple file,

271
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.400
then print.

272
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.790
I don't have to put that print.

273
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.850
It's gonna put it on the screen,

274
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.090
But,

275
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.590
you know,

276
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.410
it's just a command that I have.

277
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:53.930
Well,

278
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.000
leave it And I'm saying and percent greatest sign,

279
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.940
meaning Whatever the output comes out from here,

280
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.850
don't throw it on the screen.

281
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:07.350
Just put it on Definable Dumb null is just a a way to flush out the output.

282
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.600
But it doesn't mean that we're flushing out the actual operating we're not going to use it

283
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.240
would be,

284
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.210
actually will use it.

285
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.450
But it's not gonna throw that on the screen.

286
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:26.540
So now what we're gonna do is if dollar question mark is equal to zero Now what ISS dollar

287
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.150
question mark,

288
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.920
it's exit status.

289
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.940
If the command that ran earlier than that which is this?

290
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.550
So what we're saying is,

291
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:43.880
if we find a backup dot tarred a gz which was created today and that's we would define and

292
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.270
their exit status zero,

293
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.350
which is It's there.

294
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.780
Then may put then right here.

295
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.350
Then what do you want to do?

296
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:58.010
Echo back up was created Perfect,

297
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.350
right,

298
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.720
that go Just put one more line in that.

299
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:10.730
Go another and now se archiving back up because archiving being you're sending it to

300
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:16.830
another location and the another location would be you have to run the command like FTP or

301
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:24.610
SCP or whatever the command that you're running to run SCP Sex Temps as backup Qatar,

302
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.050
which is that well to wear to root,

303
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.160
um,

304
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.250
anywhere your server that you want to send it to 18 to 1 68.1 dot one or two.

305
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.350
Forex,

306
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.250
whatever.

307
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.120
And then the pie path,

308
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.860
where is gonna go,

309
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.350
too,

310
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:48.450
and then do else if it cannot find it now else's if equal.

311
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.250
If the output is not equal to one,

312
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:57.850
then what you want to do else echo back up fails.

313
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.250
Simple Is that and then just two feet.

314
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:09.110
So this is the script to actually back up the file system and actually transferring their

315
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.550
fall back of the tar file toe another location.

316
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.460
Now,

317
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.750
since we are testing it and this is like a training lab,

318
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:24.440
I just wanted to exclude this put hash here because what Hash is gonna do is gonna comment

319
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.050
out this entire line.

320
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.090
So now when me and I'm gonna run this script,

321
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.570
what it's gonna do is if this file backup file exist,

322
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.450
that is going to say backup was created and archiving the backup.

323
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.390
And if it does not exist,

324
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:48.300
then it's gonna say at Gobekli failed Simple is that I'm gonna modify the permission.

325
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.040
Execute herbal to back up all system.

326
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.530
Perfect.

327
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.450
Now let's run it.

328
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.050
All right.

329
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.750
Moment of truth.

330
00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:01.050
You know what is doing?

331
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.950
It is backing up your false system.

332
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:03.950
-

333
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:36.010
Mm

334
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.010
.

335
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.600
You see,

336
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.290
just what happened here came back and it says back up that tar find no such file or

337
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.730
directory.

338
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.450
Why is that?

339
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.250
Ah,

340
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.970
occurs,

341
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.350
Let's see what our script is doing.

342
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:57.550
Our script is first tarring and putting it right here.

343
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.150
And then ah,

344
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.190
see right here.

345
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.450
I did not specify the slash backup,

346
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.750
so I'll do war backup FS.

347
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.750
I have to let it know where that file is located.

348
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.550
And Wallace temp.

349
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.030
So that's what you have to do it here.

350
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.470
You have to specify the absolute path again because if you are running from somewhere else

351
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.470
,

352
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.250
it will complain.

353
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.910
Now it should run.

354
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.850
But now I don't want to run it.

355
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:34.250
I wanted to common that out because we already have the back dot cheesy.

356
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:41.200
That's where if I temp back up such easy.

357
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.570
Yes,

358
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.060
we have it.

359
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.350
Now let's run our script and it says Backup was created are coming.

360
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.690
Perfect.

361
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.560
Now what if I delete that?

362
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.260
Yes.

363
00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.960
Now I run the script back a field.

364
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.910
They go Bingo anyway,

365
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.780
So that's how you need to create a backup.

366
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.950
