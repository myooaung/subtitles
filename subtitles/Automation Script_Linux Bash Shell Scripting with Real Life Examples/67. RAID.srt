1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Let's go over the raid.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,880
What exactly a raid is?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:13,180
A raid stands for redundant array off independent disks or sometimes all often referred to

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,620
as inexpensive disk and raid.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,620
Why do we need raid?

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,380
Well,

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,280
to create a redundancy,

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,990
meaning if one disc dies,

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,960
you have another desk,

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,310
right?

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,020
You don't want to lose your data if one the fun of your primary disguise.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,500
So that's the primary reason we have raid.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,070
And there are different type of rates.

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,880
The main ones that you will cover in this lessons are three rates raid 01 and five.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,230
And how do they work?

16
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,150
Let's go over them.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,950
In raid zero,

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,490
you have one disc.

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,040
That is,

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,360
let's say,

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,050
five kick.

22
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,640
You add another disc that becomes 10 gig.

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,010
So you put them together and that five plus five becomes 10.

24
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,220
Gig,

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,660
right.

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,400
Perfect.

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,810
So you are writing to both disc one.

28
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,220
And here,

29
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,360
when they're its going across,

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,150
is faster,

31
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,800
of course.

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,880
But what happens if you lose one disc?

33
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,350
Well,

34
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,690
you're out of luck.

35
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:08,990
Why?

36
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,100
Because you have lost all your data.

37
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,540
So there is most of the time.

38
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,600
Raid zero is used for,

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,850
um,

40
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,620
like data warehousing or backups that you really,

41
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,770
really gonna use.

42
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,050
So things like that.

43
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,960
So you do need to add a couple of disk physical disk together to make one big disk.

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,580
That's how rate want.

45
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,950
Zero is mostly used.

46
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,550
Let's talk about raid one that will eliminate the disadvantage of raid zero where we lose

47
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,900
one disk and then you're out of luck.

48
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,060
In raid one,

49
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,130
you have one disk,

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,170
and then you have another desk.

51
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,850
But you mirrored them together.

52
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,350
Meaning,

53
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,170
if you have five gig off space on one,

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,070
you have to have five.

55
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,960
Give another one.

56
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,450
But that does not mean you have.

57
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,610
You're gonna have 10 get together because you're not adding them together you have

58
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,190
mirroring,

59
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,750
mirroring them together.

60
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,360
So if you lose one desk,

61
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,030
that's fine.

62
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,700
You still get the get your data from the other disk.

63
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,700
But there is another disadvantages to raid one,

64
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,950
and that is slow.

65
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,820
There it is slow because it has to,

66
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,680
um,

67
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,250
replicate everything from one days to another so that some sometime gets are slow readings

68
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,250
,

69
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,050
little rights,

70
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,680
then to solve.

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,520
All these problems are on zero and one.

72
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,500
What do we do then?

73
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,100
01 has,

74
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,490
uh,

75
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,040
uh we have arrested lose date as your raid one.

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,630
We have slow reading,

77
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:37,990
right.

78
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,990
So we come up with Raid five in raid five.

79
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,800
You have one disk,

80
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,150
right?

81
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,700
Then you have another disc.

82
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,070
But this time you don't just add to it.

83
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,220
You actually copy everything to a 2nd 1 as well.

84
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,490
But in raid five,

85
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,280
you have to have three or more disks.

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,400
Why?

87
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,890
Because the way the way rate fireworks is,

88
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,230
it will write to the first disc.

89
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,770
And it will put some information about that data to the second disc.

90
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,720
It will write to the second this,

91
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,640
and it will put some off that information that it's has written to the third disc.

92
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,970
And it goes around like a round robin like that.

93
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,530
So,

94
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,540
in case you lose one desk doesn't matter if it's the 1st 2nd 3rd you will have the

95
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,830
information off the lost data on one of the disk that you still have.

96
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,970
That's how you create rate five.

97
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,250
But in this case,

98
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,910
you're not gonna have,

99
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,070
like,

100
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
555 15 because you have to write some off the desk information.

101
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,780
That's parity to some other desk as well.

102
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,150
So they say you could retrieve that information.

103
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,820
So in order to put that information somewhere,

104
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,050
it needs to reserve that space for it.

105
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,100
And that's why we get out of it,

106
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,200
like 12 with their team gig of space.

107
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,210
So that's how raid works.

108
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,080
And the reason I I am covering raid.

109
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,170
And this training is because that's one of the where basic questions often been asked

110
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,100
during interviews and as a system administrator.

111
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,950
When you do become a system administrator in Lenox Environment,

112
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,950
you will have to create raid at a hardware level.

113
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,880
When you have a silver coming into your corporate environment,

114
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,220
you would have to configure a rate.

115
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,060
And the difference between the primary difference between grade and L V.

116
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,560
M is that raid is mostly configured on the physical system,

117
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,790
physical servers and sorry,

118
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,720
not physical physical disks,

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,920
whereas L.

120
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,140
V.

121
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,990
M is mostly configured on a virtual or logical disks.

122
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,230
So that's a primary difference.

123
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,230
So please remember it.

124
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,390
If you want to learn more about other rates,

125
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,250
I would encourage you to go online and find out about other rates
