1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
tap completion and up arrow key In this lesson,

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,020
we will learn how When we run the tab button on your keyboard,

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,640
how can it completes your directory or your command that you're trying to run and how the

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,630
up arrow key works and how returns you last round command hitting tab key completes

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,220
available commands,

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,680
files or directories such as when you running change.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,050
Meyer mod this command,

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,680
it has o.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,710
D at the end as well.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,450
So if you just type C h M and hit Tab,

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,790
it completes the command for you the same way when you do ls Space Jay and a tab,

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,550
it will list all the files that starts with J.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,350
Then you have CD D s.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,110
So if you do see d d as headed tab,

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:04,670
it will bring you any all the directories that matches the 1st 3 letters uppercase de es.

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,000
So basically,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,390
the tab makes ah typing a lot easier and Lennox,

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,940
so you don't have to run the whole long commands again and again,

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,890
you could just simply tab if you know the command and it auto completes it for you.

20
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,870
This is very useful feature and Lennox I'm telling you,

21
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,350
this is very useful.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,570
Once you're gonna become a riel export in Lennox,

23
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,800
you're gonna be using this tab button almost every day.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,550
And every time you logged into Lennox Machine,

25
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,680
then we have another cool feature off.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,500
Lennox is heading the up arrow key.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,010
What that does is every time you hit up arrow key,

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,580
it will bring you the last ran command on your Linux terminal.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,830
Isn't that cool?

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,070
It is cool because you don't have to run the command again and again and again.

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,060
So you just hit up a rocky and boom and hit Enter and we'll run that last comment.

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,700
So let's see how these Katou,

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,250
um,

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,050
tab and a park He works in our Lennox machine.

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:23,200
Let's clear the screen.

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,720
Um,

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,150
so the first command I want sure use.

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,440
Let's say if you have C h m and more deep,

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,250
this is the commands of what if I just take out CH OD and just right now hit tab.

40
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,880
It completes that command for me.

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,720
But if I just do see it and hit tab twice now,

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,490
it will give you all the commands you see that starts with C H Now,

43
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,320
you know,

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,930
there are many other different commands that start with C.

45
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,170
H.

46
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,010
And you could try different commands to see as long as you know about the command.

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,050
So don't run in command that you really don't know.

48
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,630
Or you I would recommend you run man command on that before you running it.

49
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:16,360
So another way we could check our tab is if you wanted to do ls And I want to do Ah,

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,160
J.

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,650
I wanted to list all the father has Jerry and I will have tapped.

52
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,070
There you go see it.

53
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,230
Auto completes my jerry.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,090
Why did that?

55
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,320
Because most likely,

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,280
I only have Jay fall starting with just one file,

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,760
which is this is the one J Let's say they are to files that starts with three files.

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,040
Actually,

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,550
that starts with L,

60
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,340
lex,

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,990
Lisa and Lois.

62
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,720
And let's see what happens when I do ls and do l and hit tab twice.

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,620
It gave me all three files that starts with l.

64
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,090
Isn't that cool?

65
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,250
You don't have to actually go into the directory.

66
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,010
Full do ls minus.

67
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,440
L look for your father.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,050
As long as you remember the first letter and you hit tab.

69
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,200
It will give you everything that starts with it.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,670
Same way we'll do ls minus.

71
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,340
L and let's say for want to do desktop.

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,920
I wanted to see the into desktop,

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,280
etc.

74
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,410
There is this,

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,890
um,

76
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,040
folder we have in our home director desktop.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,330
Right.

78
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,130
We could do CD this de es Kate s top type.

79
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,950
The whole thing Get enter ongoing.

80
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,760
Let's go one step back again.

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,780
Or we could just do CD desk and hit tab and it auto completes it for you and you hit enter

82
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:29,780
.

83
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,920
Isn't that cool?

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,530
Will save you a lot of time.

85
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,420
I love this this feature off Lenox,

86
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,180
and I'm sure you're gonna love it too.

87
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,570
Now,

88
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,280
the 2nd 1 what I was talking about is the up arrow key.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,250
So if you hit upper key right now on your desktop,

90
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,810
you'll see it will return the last command that we ran.

91
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,500
If you hit it again,

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,960
it will keep bringing all the commands that we ran in the sequential order seats.

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,600
So far,

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,490
we have ran so many commands and it's bringing everything.

95
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,220
So now if you type the lower case,

96
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,950
the down key,

97
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,680
it will bring you back to all the commands that you were last friends.

98
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,120
Now we didn't run any command.

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,090
Um,

100
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,160
after CD desktop,

101
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,440
if we wanna go back again.

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,410
Up arrow key,

103
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,600
desktop leg.

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
So now,

105
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,040
um,

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,650
let's say I want to do this m I want to do so.

107
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,210
Um Ah,

108
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,600
Let's see.

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
What is,

110
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
um,

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,650
Ellis?

112
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,710
And what is pwd and clear?

113
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,410
And one more command.

114
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,960
We will run.

115
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,170
Let's say date Date is another commander will cover later on.

116
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,400
And so you're on it.

117
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,710
It will give you the date off your system.

118
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,350
So now,

119
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,790
um,

120
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,490
you ran a few commands 45 commands.

121
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:46,730
Now,

122
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,270
instead of typing all those commands,

123
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:48,900
you could run.

124
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,080
You could up arrow key.

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,200
One time,

126
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,890
two times,

127
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,550
three times,

128
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,940
four times five times.

129
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,250
And it is bringing all the commands you ran.

130
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,380
So,

131
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,710
guys,

132
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,260
this is what it is all about.

133
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,870
The up arrow key and tap key.

134
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm telling you,

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,620
this is gonna make things so much easier once you're gonna become expert at the end of this

136
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,090
course.

137
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,800
All right?

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,850
I hope you really like this one.

139
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,370
And I really want you to practice this tab and a perky again and again,

140
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,700
again.

141
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,150
So you will know how these both features work.
