1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
wild cards.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,560
What are while cards,

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,500
just as his name says they are wild cards,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,160
meeting.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,620
If you play cards and,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,360
you know,

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,250
in poker or blackjack,

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,900
they do pick a card like a 10 or nine,

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,650
whatever the card,

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,160
and you could match it to any of the card to make your flash trail or whatever that you

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,410
like.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,000
So that is kind of a wild card.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,930
So just like that in Lennox,

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,480
we used wild cards to get the output that you were looking for.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,080
Ah,

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,860
wild card is a character now.

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,610
This is a definition right from the Lennox Dictionary that can be used as a substitute from

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,690
any off a class of characters in a search.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,620
So there are many wild cards,

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,980
but the most basic ones I have listed here they're three.

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,140
The 1st 1 is the one I use most of time is asterisk,

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,250
which is also referred to as a star.

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,550
Ah star represents zero or more characters,

24
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,380
anything that matches but that star placeholder.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,600
We'll look into that in a moment when we actually used the star wildcard in our Lennox

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,200
machine.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,500
That we have question more represents a single character so if you have Ah,

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,560
file name,

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,780
text and you're looking for any files that has the word text.

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,320
And you could use t e instead of ex.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,570
You could just put question mark in there and then t that means what ever files that had t

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,950
e doesn't matter what's inside off the X and the last letter is X the tea,

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,850
then it work.

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,940
The 3rd 1 we have brackets,

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,290
which represents a range of characters.

36
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,860
So it's better we look at in done limits machine to understand them more deeply.

37
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,550
I'm gonna bring up my machine real quick.

38
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,960
Where did it go?

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,220
Right here on long den hallways is myself and I'm in my home directory.

40
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,890
Of course.

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,800
Now,

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,010
um right now these are the files in directories in Exist in my home directory.

43
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,600
I want to create nine files that has a name that's a A B,

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,730
C D one and X y Z and then same thing instead of one.

45
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,940
It just increments the number 23456 I could do this.

46
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,220
Touch a B c d one dash x y z one time,

47
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,410
then hit up Arrow key again.

48
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,360
Change wanted to changed to three and keep going.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
But don't you think it's cumbersome?

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,490
A tedious It is.

51
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:54,870
Right.

52
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,450
So we use wild card to perform that task because you're gonna create nine files.

53
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,740
So it's just a practice that we're doing for nine follows.

54
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,350
Trust me.

55
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,130
In a corporate environment,

56
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,260
you're probably gonna have to create,

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,470
like,

58
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,420
thousands of miles.

59
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,190
What you gonna do?

60
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,630
You gonna just hit up arrow key and or type it 1000 times?

61
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,250
No,

62
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,570
that's not productive.

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,250
So then what do you do?

64
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,660
Use wild cards?

65
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,790
So first of all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove these files one by one.

66
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,560
Again.

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,450
I could removed vile card as well,

68
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,670
But let's created first and I'll show you how I could remove it.

69
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,150
So I have two left now.

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,750
I could use a wildcard to remove both in one shot removed,

71
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,930
ABC wild card.

72
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,560
So what is telling it?

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,940
Removed everything that has a farm name that starts with a B C and whatever that comes

74
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,490
afterwards.

75
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,200
You don't care.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,870
Just remove it.

77
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,940
Hit,

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,520
Enter.

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,120
That's myself here and you'll see all those two files are gone.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,370
Now I'm gonna create nine files and to create nine falls.

81
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,460
I'll use the command touch as you know,

82
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:05,940
the touches.

83
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,130
A command to use.

84
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,060
And then there's a wild card,

85
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,020
another oil card that's called curly Braces.

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:20,960
So I was creating filed A B C d curly braces one dot dot nine because I'm gonna create nine

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,380
files.

88
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,720
So this curly braces 1.9 selling create nine files that has digit one through nine and Dash

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,150
X Y z.

90
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,340
When I run this command,

91
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,430
what do you think that I will have listed in my home directory?

92
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,030
I will have nine files right here at the bottom.

93
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,950
You'll see.

94
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,950
I have nine files.

95
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,050
Awesome,

96
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,860
right?

97
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,050
This is what you wanted to do?

98
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:59,490
It is much more faster to do in the wild card as opposed to typing what by one.

99
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,990
So let's use the gastric.

100
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,500
It what?

101
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,550
I just want to list every file name that starts with a B.

102
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,070
C.

103
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,670
You do ABC ass trick,

104
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,770
and you will have all the files that starts with a B.

105
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,250
C.

106
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,840
I want to remove every file that starts with a B.

107
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,290
C.

108
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,000
You could remove one by one a B,

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,610
C D.

110
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,130
One and so on and so forth again.

111
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,200
Very cumbersome.

112
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,070
Don't do it.

113
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,390
Your system administrator.

114
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,080
You are smart folks.

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,830
You don't want to use the commands one by one.

116
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,630
What do you would use?

117
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,010
You use a wild card so you'll do a,

118
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,380
B,

119
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,090
C D or a B.

120
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,350
And to Astra the reason I picked the four letters.

121
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,310
Because if I just pick a and hit Asterix,

122
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,350
it will also remove any other files in my home directory that starts with a and which I

123
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,770
don't want to do it right now.

124
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,890
I don't have any file.

125
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:05,080
So let's say if I create a touch A So now I have all the files and a so I just want confirm

126
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,800
I don't have a so I don't delete any file accidentally.

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,200
So yes,

128
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,910
I don't have any.

129
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,410
Father begins with a other than these.

130
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,710
So if I just do it removed a Asterix ever removed all the files that starts with Kate.

131
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,950
Let's check it.

132
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,820
See,

133
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,760
all those files are gone.

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
Isn't that cool?

135
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,350
Yes,

136
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,860
it is.

137
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,340
I love this asteroid because I use it all the time.

138
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:39,860
I'm gonna recreate those files again by heard hitting up arrow key that will return my last

139
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,700
ran command.

140
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,160
Just confirm they're there now.

141
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,220
What if I wanted to remove everything that ends with X y z?

142
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,030
Same way removed.

143
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,390
But this time we'll put Asterix in front off X Y z it enter.

144
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,070
Boom!

145
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,170
All gone.

146
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,850
Awesome!

147
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm gonna recreate it just for the exercise off this lesson.

148
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,020
It created nine files.

149
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,620
Now we'll want to the next wild card.

150
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,470
But is the question mark,

151
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,870
The next question mark is telling it ls minus.

152
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,060
L question Mark B C d pastoring.

153
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,130
Okay,

154
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,830
what am I asking here?

155
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:32,090
I'm asking is gave me all the files that has whatever the character is the first,

156
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,940
as long as the other characters has B,

157
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,460
C,

158
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,060
D.

159
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,610
And whatever comes afterwards,

160
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,840
these are the matching files because whatever the first characters weathers a or not,

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,620
I don't care.

162
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,570
I just want to make sure I will get the listing of the files that has B,

163
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:49,960
C.

164
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,310
D.

165
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:59,020
And after the So that's how you use the question Mark and the last one we have brackets

166
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:11,900
bracket is gonna tell me that gives me anything that has C or D letter in a file.

167
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,110
It's just that simple either.

168
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,560
See,

169
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,630
either d either f or this and that.

170
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,810
So you put all that stuff that you're looking for inside of the bracket and you will have

171
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,470
all those files you see here.

172
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,720
And it went so fast,

173
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,970
I'm gonna put it in mawr.

174
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,950
Put.

175
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,020
I want to see one page at a time and you'll see it gave me.

176
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,750
And it has a has be every file that I'm getting as either has A or B either has A or B.

177
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,180
So that's how it works.

178
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,890
That's how wild card works again.

179
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,620
Now I want to get rid of all the files that has,

180
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,350
um why x and y in it.

181
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,080
Awesome.

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,730
I have my wild card.

183
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,650
I'm not gonna go into leave one by one.

184
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:09,210
So this command is telling the show that go head and please delete all the files that has X

185
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,390
and Y in it.

186
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,260
And X and Y has to be together,

187
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,850
Of course.

188
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,510
So we do have these matching files X y,

189
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,950
and it was good and delete it,

190
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,210
and all of them are gone.

191
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,510
So while card not necessarily is used just with LS or removed,

192
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,200
you could use it that any of the commands you we have.

193
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,050
You could use it with all the commands we have learned so far.

194
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,920
Try it,

195
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,140
try it with different commands.

196
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,180
If it doesn't work,

197
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,050
that's OK.

198
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,010
Go online.

199
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,030
Google it and try wild clad while Clark Examples Try them.

200
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,370
Just get familiar with them.

201
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,800
This will help you a lot in your job,

202
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,540
I promise you.
