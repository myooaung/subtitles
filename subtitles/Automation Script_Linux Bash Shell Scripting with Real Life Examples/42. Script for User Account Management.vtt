00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
user account management.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.550
This is the lesson we are going to cover how we could automate these user account creation

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.550
.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.020
Now,

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.450
why do we need to create user account?

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.450
Ah,

7
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.180
and why do we have to have automation around when we all we have to do is to run a user,

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.980
add command,

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.250
right?

10
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.390
Well,

11
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.560
that's very good question,

12
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.160
But what happened is sometimes you are working in an environment where your system it is

13
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.450
also being accessed by other users.

14
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.850
Let's say key warrior development,

15
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.750
and they also need to create user account for their own group.

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.600
But they don't have root privileges.

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800
Um,

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.750
or that's one reason that you need to automate the user account creation that you could.

19
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.870
You don't want them to run user at command and,

20
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.200
you know,

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.640
make a mistake or mess up USC password file,

22
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.390
or even delete uses accidentally so you don't want to give them root access.

23
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.650
So what do you do is you created an automation tool,

24
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.330
which will allow them to Onley.

25
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.550
Enter the users.

26
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.720
Here's a name and some information,

27
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.650
and it will create that account for you.

28
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.240
You could actually create Sue Do writes for them and that's how they could do it.

29
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.060
That's one of the reason that mostly people do.

30
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.350
And that's one of the reason I created that script in the past as well.

31
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.850
Where I was working environment There's ICTY Co was huge,

32
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.200
but they were all interlinked where there was a cure department development apartment and,

33
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.340
um ah,

34
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.850
database group networking group all needed access to the user accounts and Lennox.

35
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.200
So we didn't want to give them the full access.

36
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.450
We created this automation.

37
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.310
Well,

38
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.980
another way is that even if you do not have that type off environment,

39
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.250
you're the only one you want to create users.

40
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.150
You could create them,

41
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.930
but then again,

42
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.640
you could produce or at command.

43
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.350
You would have to remember it again.

44
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.640
What was the option chosen whether that,

45
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.480
um,

46
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.700
use already exists or not.

47
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.310
But anyway,

48
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.950
this is what this whole lesson is about.

49
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.820
What are we going to cover in this lesson is that first thing is we will create a script

50
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.350
that will simp really create a user account by just asking,

51
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.360
Um,

52
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.250
what is is using name and the user account is created and done.

53
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.620
Seconds that I will create is it will error out if the user already exists.

54
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.650
Let's say if you are creating an account that say,

55
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.550
Jerry,

56
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.950
and if a jerry account already exists,

57
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.170
it will ever out and I will tell you Hey,

58
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.250
this account already exists.

59
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.920
Second thing that I want to add a za third script is add a user now you could use user add

60
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.470
minus C option to provide the description.

61
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.350
But most of time people do forget to input that description.

62
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.530
Are Jews that my C option?

63
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.950
So we could add that to the script as well.

64
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.050
The fourth script that we will write will combine everything,

65
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.520
but also add the user with I d option meaning if you want to create a user,

66
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.400
it some Pacific user,

67
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.000
i d.

68
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.150
It will ask you to put that user I d in and we're creating.

69
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.560
So what happened is Lennox system,

70
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.360
and you do user at command followed by the user.

71
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.920
It will auto generate a user i d.

72
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.390
Based on the S E password,

73
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.920
and it will add one to the last created user I D.

74
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.750
And it will give the user i d to the account,

75
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.990
but more sometimes there are applications that require Pacific user account.

76
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.200
So for that purpose,

77
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.750
you have to specify user I d.

78
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.380
And then the last group that I will create fifth script with you is adding everything that

79
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.950
we discuss all four scrip.

80
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.410
But but that people also error out if their user I d exists,

81
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.250
it will do the check.

82
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.860
So this is a whole combined script.

83
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.260
It's a little longer script,

84
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.950
so we'll cover that one scrip at a time.

85
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.970
So again,

86
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.970
I have my machine right here.

87
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.650
My lyrics machine and to,

88
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.850
um,

89
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.490
save time,

90
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.660
save my time,

91
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.490
Save your time While your time is more swell,

92
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.690
more valuable S o.

93
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.850
I have created through five scripts already.

94
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.560
And if you notice I have these five scripts create user one creatures of 2345 I will go

95
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.820
over each script one at a time,

96
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.980
but you have to write those scripts again.

97
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.650
Those scripts are in the text document Attash to this lesson.

98
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.850
You could download that,

99
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.030
um,

100
00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:02.500
no pad on and you could view that text fall and then simply copy paste or type it.

101
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.250
I would prefer that you type most of the time and you copy Paste.

102
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.000
Something goes wrong with the script and doesn't war so tight anyway.

103
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.610
So let's look at our first script.

104
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.750
The I Create user one.

105
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.700
All right,

106
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.130
variable on the day description describable to create a user account.

107
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.950
Modify date.

108
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.730
I already have that again.

109
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.740
No waste of time.

110
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.260
Next thing echo,

111
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.380
please per wide.

112
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.750
Ah,

113
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.350
user name.

114
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.650
This is simply it's asking your users to provide the user name and it's going to read,

115
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.830
um,

116
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.660
input and Ecologists line and then simply is going to run the command user.

117
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.050
Add with the variable and variable we have you and the variable is the one that's provided

118
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.220
by the user.

119
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.250
And then,

120
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.290
once that account is created,

121
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.260
is going to see echo.

122
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.950
User account has been created.

123
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.450
Simple right?

124
00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.230
Straightforward,

125
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.860
yes.

126
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.750
So let's run it.

127
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.550
Create user one.

128
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.150
Please provide a user name.

129
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.450
Jerry Hit.

130
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.120
Enter Jerry.

131
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.480
Account has been created.

132
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.300
Perfect.

133
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:25.450
My script ran awesome verified Grip Jerry from password file and you will see it created

134
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.060
the Jerry account with User I.

135
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.450
D.

136
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.150
Group I D Home Directory and my show.

137
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.550
That's the first group.

138
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.350
Second is I wanted to create a script that will ask the same thing,

139
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.610
but it will ever out the the user that hate this user already exist.

140
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.750
So I can't create as user i d for that.

141
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.850
So for for for that script I have created second script called That's clear,

142
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:04.800
B.

143
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.550
I create user too.

144
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.250
Hit Enter.

145
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.520
Same thing again to the ah little modify description.

146
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.340
Please provide user I d.

147
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.460
S are using name read user read you echo right here,

148
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.890
command.

149
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.350
That's where it's I'm adding that check it will check if they use their existence.

150
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.750
How is gonna check right here First is going to run the command grab,

151
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.380
but mine is Q option.

152
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.250
Que is a silent mode.

153
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.850
Don't show anything on the screen and grab the user,

154
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.050
which is that container would just use a specified from etc past.

155
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.960
Okay,

156
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.240
good.

157
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.430
Now I'm saying if the error code is equal to sorry,

158
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.720
the the exit status is equal to zero.

159
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.950
Meaning if it does find it right,

160
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.970
If my command is successful,

161
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.250
it will give me zero right?

162
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.250
And the only way it could be successful if it actually returned something.

163
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.550
So if it is zero,

164
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:11.810
then echo ever user.

165
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.250
This variable already exists Echo please choose another user name.

166
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.790
Echo Exit zero.

167
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.550
Just exit out.

168
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.750
Don't do anything feet.

169
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.350
If that is not equal to zero.

170
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.150
If it's something else,

171
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.150
then it will add the user.

172
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.650
Then we'll go through it.

173
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.490
If this goes through.

174
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:47.020
If this checks is work perfect than error out otherwise you run this command user,

175
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:54.750
add your user account has let's run it create.

176
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.550
Used to please provide user name.

177
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.930
We created a user name earlier,

178
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.400
Jerry.

179
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.750
Right,

180
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.410
Well created again and it stays Error.

181
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.990
User Jerry already exists.

182
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.950
Please choose another user name.

183
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.320
That's what we wanted to do if I run the same command again.

184
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.480
And this time I picked another user.

185
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.750
Let's say Cramer,

186
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.530
this is Kramer.

187
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.650
Account has been created.

188
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:29.200
You could check that and you will see right here.

189
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.730
Cramer was user I d.

190
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:38.350
And from 1003 to 1004 it added one number to it.

191
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.900
Okay,

192
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.600
so this is a 2nd 3rd script we wanted to do is add user description right here.

193
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.500
The 3rd 1 ad use a description.

194
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.770
So the way you could add,

195
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.340
use the descriptions by running the command,

196
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.150
use or add,

197
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.100
and the user name whatever and minus C is the option.

198
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.250
And then you put in the code,

199
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.850
um uh,

200
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.700
system,

201
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.770
admin guy or whatever,

202
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.950
and then you run it,

203
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.430
but most of time,

204
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.260
people don't use that.

205
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.530
But we want to force that user to add values.

206
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.260
Your description.

207
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.650
So I created a script.

208
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.580
The I create.

209
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.740
Use a three added hub data description.

210
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.290
Same thing.

211
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.550
Please provide user name.

212
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.600
It will do the check.

213
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.750
Same thing if the user exists,

214
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.980
it will come down right here.

215
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.000
Next one echo,

216
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.710
please provide.

217
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.150
I use a description read de as invariable.

218
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.830
And then right here says user,

219
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:46.550
add the variables you minus C option for description and the d the description.

220
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:52.050
The reason I put a coat around D variable is because,

221
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.220
as you could actually add,

222
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.900
use a description with spaces.

223
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.080
So if you have spaces,

224
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.450
then you have to have a coat around.

225
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.860
All right.

226
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.550
Time to run it.

227
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.850

228
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:13.090

229
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.050

which is to address it.

253
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.990
Four scrip is to add a user I d.

254
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.210
Now what if you don't want the Lennox to pick a society for you?

255
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.250
You want to specify that users perfect.

256
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.650
Clear the screen for that I have already created.

257
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.050
And scrip,

258
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:38.220
which is create user four dinner Updated The description now here.

260
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.220

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.640
Please provide user name.

262
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.670
Everything is the same.

263
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.050
To check if user account exists right here.

264
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.040
Echoey,

265
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.650
please provide us a description.

266
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.320
And now from here,

267
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.250
this point on this is a new stuff we have added.

268
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.950
This is gonna ask this user echo.

269
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:03.970
Do you want to specify a user I d Because we also want to give the use of the option to say

270
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.150
yes or no.

271
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.860
Or we could just simply force a user to say Hey,

272
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.250
please enter user I D.

273
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.810
But What if you if the user doesn't want to add it?

274
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.190
They wanted Lennox to pick itself.

275
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.830
So that's why we have given the user bought option.

276
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.850
I just specify yes or no.

277
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.170
So we're gonna say echo.

278
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.420
Do you want to specify user?

279
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.500
I d Why?

280
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.320
Slash and read.

281
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.780
And this is a variable.

282
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.990
I just pick why and you echo now here we saying,

283
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:40.640
if the variable equal why why I pick equal equal sign?

284
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.050
Because this is what works Would letters If I had digit or entered your dear,

285
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:55.350
I would pick dash e que But since it's a letter I'm picking equal equal why So what I'm

286
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.910
saying is,

287
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.100
if the user enters,

288
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.120
why then,

289
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.730
Eckel,

290
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.160
please,

291
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.050
and to use right,

292
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.250
right,

293
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:03.650
Perfect.

294
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:10.150
And then once the Jews ideas entered put that in a variable and named the variable You I d

295
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.850
Okay,

296
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:17.680
And then what to do and then simply use their i d bits and has been specified.

297
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.720
Then you run the commanders or add minus U minus c with the description and mine issue is

298
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:23.990
mine.

299
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:29.020
Issue is the option to add user i d and use I t is the one that's been specified by the

300
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.450
user.

301
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:34.250
And this question Perfect echo,

302
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.750
echo user account.

303
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.950
Now,

304
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.790
what if the user say's no if the user pic No,

305
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.720
I don't want it to pickle.

306
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.160
You're so I d Then what do you do then?

307
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.350
You come down here,

308
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:54.360
then you say l If the statement is you have to use is l.

309
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.530
If remember,

310
00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:01.850
we we had if then else but else does is else Ah,

311
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:11.050
if you say yes then do then do this else drew whatever that you specify.

312
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:18.370
But now since we have to specifically say and as the letter en So that's why we have to

313
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:24.040
pick l if l f user input is right here.

314
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.650

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.760
Awesome.

370
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.340
Okay,

371
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.340
now everything is working as expected.

372
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.850
Last thing we wanted to do is what if I had picked a user I d.

373
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.160
That's been assigned to Let's say,

374
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.770
cherry,

375
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.350
which is 1003.

376
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.220
It would have been a problem,

377
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.450
right?

378
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:49.330
Yes,

379
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.440
but before we put that fort script,

380
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.950
let's the rules do.

381
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.850
Let's run that script again,

382
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.160
and this time will pick.

383
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.450
No,

384
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.260
just to make sure our no works as well,

385
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.500
right?

386
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.760
You want to test both options?

387
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.950
Creators of four,

388
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.640
please provide user name.

389
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.320
So I picked already all four characters going on to the next one,

390
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.620
huh?

391
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.780
Bobby Peck.

392
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.480
Ah,

393
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.990
what's the characters off Seinfeld show?

394
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.620
This is ready for my I'm picking those user cactus.

395
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.160
How about,

396
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.050

397
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.770
You guys know David Puddy?

398
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.550
Probably if you watch Seinfeld show.

399
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.050
That's a David Puddy.

400
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:27.950
Elaine's boyfriend.

401
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.210
Ah,

402
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.050
so you'll pick just David enter.

403
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.150
Please provide us a description date.

404
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.050
Elaine.

405
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:43.520
Boyfriend Do you want specify?

406
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.260
User I d.

407
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.760
I would say no this time.

408
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.020
It says no worries.

409
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.400
We will assign a user i d.

410
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.530
This is what we wanted to do,

411
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:50.850
right?

412
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.510
David?

413
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.590
Account has been created.

414
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.160
Okay,

415
00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:01.160
let's see what I did has been assigned I Society eight.

416
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.030
Okay.

417
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.420
Hey,

418
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.550
why didn't it a sign?

419
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:11.950
Anything after Jerry or you know what?

420
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:16.450
Let's do cat password and you notice it has three.

421
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:22.660
34 2005 six is not taken.

422
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.720
78 Why didn't assign six?

423
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.910
Well,

424
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.010
this is by default,

425
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:33.360
but Lennox always picks the I d from the last i d.

426
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.070
So if it's last,

427
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.050
I d that see when?

428
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.500
If I change into 10 it will pick.

429
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.720
The next one is 11.

430
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.260
That's Ah,

431
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.500
this accounting mechanism it has.

432
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.580
So that's how it picked anyway.

433
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.760
Let's go back to our script.

434
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.720
Let's not talk about how it creates user account now.

435
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.740
The last one and the last one is the longest.

436
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.700
One is that we wanted to do everything that we just did.

437
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.760
It's clear the screen.

438
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.980
But this time we want to do is last one error out of user I d exist.

439
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.450
OK,

440
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.060
so we do everything.

441
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.690
But this time,

442
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.650
if the user ideas picked that is already in debt,

443
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.260
See file.

444
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.020
I wanted to ever out No problem.

445
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.490
Let's see how we could add that in there.

446
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.950
So I have created a script for it.

447
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.180
Creators of five everything.

448
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.380
The same description is the modified same thing.

449
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.660
Please provide Use user name checking the user name exist.

450
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:34.950
Next one is Please provide us a description then echo.

451
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.630
Do you want to special user I d.

452
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.650
This is what we did in the last group or affect Everything is perfect.

453
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.550
Now right here.

454
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.660
If you notice this is the part that I added.

455
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:52.660
So if you are creating this script,

456
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:59.890
I would recommend you to copy your create creatures Air Force scrip and paste it as a new

457
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:00.350
one.

458
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.530
Ah,

459
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.140
name it.

460
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:02.990
Create five.

461
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.140
And then you could modify.

462
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.890
But coming directly into this line where it says read,

463
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.450
use already.

464
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.450
Then you add these lines here.

465
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.360
All right.

466
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:11.660
So what?

467
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.190
This line is good again.

468
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.200
It's going to do the same thing.

469
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.850
Group que user i d from password.

470
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.550
Remember the same way we did.

471
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:27.080
If you go back up to check the user i d right here It did the same thing right from etc

472
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:33.450
Password So the same mechanism or same Syntex of the scriptural will implement right here.

473
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:39.270
So we'll do great que which is silent user i d which is specified by the user right here

474
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.160
from etc past.

475
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.480
And if the status um,

476
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:51.730
the exit status is zero then meaning if it finds it an echo averages their i d already

477
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.260
exists.

478
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:59.350
Go empty line Exit X zero meaning completely exit entire script.

479
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.880
Okay.

480
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.870
If it does not exist If it does not exist then Ron User,

481
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.240
Add with minus you option time,

482
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.590
not mine.

483
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.950
Is your option with minus you.

484
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.260
Ah,

485
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.850
variable minus C as a description.

486
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:22.260
De is the description variable minus you and issues.

487
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:22.450
Right?

488
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.660
Okay.

489
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.180
And then echo user account has already been created.

490
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.970
This is the check,

491
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.160
right?

492
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.050
If the check past,

493
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.550
it will create that.

494
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.250
Now,

495
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.940
this one next coming down here,

496
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.300
it's the same thing that we have.

497
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.830
If the user says no,

498
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.350
then you simply come to this one and run.

499
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.260
Okay,

500
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.850
so let's run this script real quick and five.

501
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.260
And this time I'm gonna pick.

502
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:59.430
Um um uh,

503
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:08.240
Stella people I uses description Still,

504
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.550
uh,

505
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.970
his mother did.

506
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:14.660
Mother of George.

507
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.160
Anyway,

508
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.600
do you want to specify use ready?

509
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.260
Yes,

510
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.790
and and to use I t 00 six.

511
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.340
I know users use this.

512
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.150
So there's a seven.

513
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:26.420
I know.

514
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.450
User 007 idea has been take,

515
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:33.090
so I'm gonna put it in just a test and says areas where I d already taken.

516
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:33.350
Right?

517
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.820
So I know the user.

518
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.310
I d six is not taken,

519
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.950
so I'm gonna put that in this time.

520
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.450
Stella.

521
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.450
Stella is mother.

522
00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.660
Yes,

523
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.670
1006 and sell account has been created.

524
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.050
Perfect group for Stella.

525
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.550
That's the password,

526
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.510
and you will see it has been assigned user I D.

527
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.050
Six.

528
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.950
And when you do cat at sea password and you'll see it's at the bottom.

529
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.100
Next time you create an account,

530
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.350
it will automatically checks for I D and a pencil new one.

531
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.490
But if a new one is already taken,

532
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.390
it will give you it automatically goes to the next one.

533
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.020
Anyway,

534
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.550
this is about this user account management.

535
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.360
Ah,

536
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.610
I hope you have learned a lot from this lesson.

537
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.050
It's a very useful scrip,

538
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:28.050
tried out a different options and different way that you wanted to add a user.
