1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
basic task rips.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,990
This is our second scripts that we will create together and this will actually execute some

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,250
basic tasks,

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,020
uh,

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,710
that are,

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,050
like,

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,740
based on some basic commands.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,850
So the task that we will define in our script as the 1st 1 is P W D.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:32,480
That will print my working directory ls which will list all the files or directories in my

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,510
current directory.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,650
Who am I?

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,540
Um,

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,210
it will print my user name that I'm logged.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,450
And with date the crunch date tell the current cat calendar and the last one I want to

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,010
create it.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,050
Three files in my directory that I'm logged in.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,070
Ah,

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,250
dead files are A B C.

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,050
And the command we was used to create them is touch.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,340
So it's just that simple.

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,090
And that script will run sequentially.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,910
If you remember,

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,710
it will do.

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,450
The 1st 1 is pwd than ls and then so on.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,350
So my machine is right here and I am going to create my second script.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,220
Make sure I am logged in as myself and wish directory on men.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm in scripts directory.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,800
Perfect.

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,650
That's the directory I wanted to be in.

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,650
Um,

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,750
so I will go ahead and v I a new file and the name off the file of a pick as they basic

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,120
tasks.

33
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,650
It's just that some and her define your show.

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,450
Author.

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,750
I'm gonna keep making you do that again and again.

36
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,150
So you will remember Date created,

37
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,910
Joe.

38
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,150
Eight money,

39
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:16,150
20 description Run.

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,650
Basic Lennox Tasks Date.

41
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,550
What was this?

42
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,180
Fort one?

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,550
Tell me.

44
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,150
Modified Yes.

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,330
Again,

46
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,490
You're not modifying.

47
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,060
We just putting today's day and I guess that's pretty much it.

48
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,580
Now,

49
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,730
I always like to start my script with Echo,

50
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,610
so it will be a new line.

51
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,050
And this time I wanted to write down Echo.

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:56,030
This script will run a few basic tasks.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,210
Now,

54
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,550
remember,

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,780
this is not a description.

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,650
This will actually output on the screen.

57
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,330
Then another echo just for a new line.

58
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,510
Now what we want to do,

59
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,640
we want to see which director we are in.

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,260
So simply,

61
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,790
just type P.

62
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,650
W d.

63
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,010
Okay,

64
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,750
it did that.

65
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,650
No,

66
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,150
let's see if he could do ls who am I?

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,150
Date cow.

68
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,450
And the last one is I wanted to create three files A b and C,

69
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,430
so that's pretty much it.

70
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,850
It's gonna run 1234 by six commands six basic tasks.

71
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:40,130
Core those tasks what exactly they're gonna do and go ahead and escape.

72
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,850
Bottle fed and right.

73
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,210
Quit Saved the file and check permissions there.

74
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,250
No permissions assigned the permission.

75
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,250
Basic tasks.

76
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,350
U Unless my cell tr just to confirm you basic task has been created.

77
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,050
Now go ahead and run basic tasks better.

78
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,340
Nice.

79
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,790
Okay,

80
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,550
let's see what it is.

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,090
Okay,

82
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,480
so this script will run a few basic commands.

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,470
This is the echo.

84
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,950
Think that we added in right?

85
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,550
Then the next thing we wanted to know which directory we are in,

86
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,750
we are in this directory.

87
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:29,650
Then l s L s will list all the directories and files inside off my exit current working

88
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,300
directory.

89
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,860
And those files are basic task and hello world.

90
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,460
So it's this own file that I just run the command and then who am I?

91
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,680
That's my name.

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,060
I am logged in as myself date.

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,000
This is the date.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,560
It's telling you what date is today and calendar.

95
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,750
This is the calendar that is output.

96
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,320
Now the last one is Hey,

97
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,450
what happened to touch ABC?

98
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,150
Did it create that file?

99
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,360
I am sure it has.

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,550
But why didn't you see in hair when it was listing that files?

101
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,570
Very good question.

102
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,720
Now let's go back to a sequence.

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,550
Remember,

104
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,770
the script works in a sequence in an order.

105
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,150
The first thing first.

106
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,570
So by the time touch ABC,

107
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,140
it hit that touch ABC.

108
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,030
It ran.

109
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,080
Ls command before that?

110
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,440
So that's why you didn't see it.

111
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,130
So now,

112
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,950
if you run it,

113
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,770
you will see your three styles in there.

114
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,260
So without running the script,

115
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,740
just two ls minus l.

116
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,650
And you will see in there.

117
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,690
There you go.

118
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,080
See you.

119
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,450
See?

120
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,870
I said I'll do ls myself to your ltro list everything in,

121
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,350
um,

122
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,360
in ah date format.

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,050
When was the last created?

124
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,360
If you see,

125
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,480
it has created a B and three C files.

126
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,340
So this is how we do our basic tax.

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,060
So if you are going through all that hassle every day and you want to automate them through

128
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,950
one simple basic tasks,

129
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,390
you could do that to simply this way again.

130
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,790
I like to keep things neat and clean.

131
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:32,780
So what I would do is I will put echo in every line Cool co and echo and then at the bottom

132
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,350
of us say echo,

133
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,750
end off screen.

134
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,250
Nice.

135
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:48,450
Welcome.

136
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,240
You guys probably knows hate in Ron just did something I didn't purposely I just put it

137
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,450
down wrong,

138
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,500
um,

139
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,850
command And let's see what the era Messi comes up.

140
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,250
Um,

141
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,050
it's run the basic tasks,

142
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,770
and it did everything I asked for.

143
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,390
Now you see,

144
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,650
it is it has given me those ABC files as well.

145
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,640
And now at the bottom,

146
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,850
it says Line 21 Command not found.

147
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,030
Okay,

148
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,750
so it's something went wrong with the script.

149
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,480
Now,

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,850
this is how you troubleshoot a script.

151
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,630
I wanted to cover that troubleshooting help part right here at the beginning.

152
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,950
Because every time you write a script,

153
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,110
there is always,

154
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,460
always a chance.

155
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,120
I would say I'm not gonna say that very little chance.

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,450
We are humans.

157
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,250
We make mistakes.

158
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,070
There's always a chance that you fat fingers some of the commander.

159
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,550
Or are you make a mistake.

160
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,150
Then script doesn't run.

161
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,010
Then how do you troubleshoot?

162
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,580
Well,

163
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,900
the Lennox offering system or the scripting shells are smart enough to tell you where the

164
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,990
problem is.

165
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,380
So it's telling you that the script is this and in line 21.

166
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,800
There's a command called E C H.

167
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,960
That command now found You want me to run the command?

168
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,630
I understand,

169
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,740
But there is no such thing as command.

170
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,220
Why?

171
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,330
Let's try it just by simply typing.

172
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,030
Yeah,

173
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,100
there is no such command.

174
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,850
So we know that in line 21 in this script there is a mistake and we have to fix it.

175
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:29,120
And the way I do it his i v i the script and I will Let's say if I'm right here or anywhere

176
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,120
,

177
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,750
I'll just do Colon 21.

178
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,620
This will bring me exactly to that line where it was complaining they go.

179
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,580
So it brought me right to the line and I see Ha.

180
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,450
Okay,

181
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,890
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

182
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,960
I left out.

183
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,550
Oh,

184
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,410
now it will run it.

185
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,050
Perfect.

186
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,810
Perfect.

187
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,050
I fix my mistake.

188
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,450
That is perfect.

189
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,950
That's how we learn.

190
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,170
So when you hit,

191
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,110
enter again run script and they go,

192
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,650
it is giving you everything that you asked for and at the end is telling you End of script

193
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:05,650
.

194
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,890
So it's It's It's again.

195
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,840
It's a good practice that you I'll put that What exactly the script will do at the

196
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
beginning that will tell the user,

197
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,180
Hey,

198
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,080
the script will run a few basic commands.

199
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,550
It will throw that out on the screen.

200
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,250
And when the script finishes,

201
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,650
it should say End of script Perfect.

202
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,470
So that's how we do.

203
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,030
Ah,

204
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,550
simple basic task using scripting language.

205
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,060
So try it out.

206
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,130
Tried different commands in there.

207
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,160
There are so many commands and Lennix,

208
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,700
I want you to try them out one by one and see how you could automate a few simple tasks and

209
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,950
fueled daily tasks.
