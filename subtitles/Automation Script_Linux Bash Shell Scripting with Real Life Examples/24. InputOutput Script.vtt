00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
input and output.

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:13.350
This lesson is about writing a script where the script will wait for the user in.

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.150
So when you run the script,

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:26.750
the script will wait for a for you to type in something so it would take your command and

5
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.620
then output based on that written statement that you have given to the script.

6
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.790
So the way it works that the things are the scripting commands that you need to use for

7
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.710
that is read which will wait for your input,

8
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.900
and the output would be eco.

9
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.300
So whatever that you input,

10
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.670
it will output to the screen using the echo comment.

11
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.120
So,

12
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.500
um,

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.140
let me lock into the machine and I will show you how this could be done before had confused

14
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.350
ume.

15
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.760
Or so I have my machine open right here,

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.420
and I am in my home.

17
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.950
I have sold my scripts directory.

18
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.870
Um,

19
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950
I am going to create a script a little,

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.050
um,

21
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.450
in put It's like that and I'm gonna go ahead.

22
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.790
Yeah,

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.550
I will define the variable.

24
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.440
Um,

25
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.630
next thing is,

26
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.290
you know,

27
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.090
you put the author I'm not going to just wait.

28
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.550
Times a date,

29
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.040
mom description and so on anyway.

30
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.940
So you you you should type everything.

31
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.650
I would definitely recommend you.

32
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.730
So again,

33
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.940
since you don't have time,

34
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.420
I really want you learn fast.

35
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.650
So don't worry about it at this.

36
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.180
Then you,

37
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.900
um you put in like,

38
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.450
um Echo.

39
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.850
Hello.

40
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.250
Hello.

41
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.150
My name having a bad time type.

42
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.200
Okay,

43
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.600
so hello.

44
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.940
My name is M Ron Capsule.

45
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.390
And as you know,

46
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.550
it will just simply display that line on the screen.

47
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.650
Now what we wanted to do next,

48
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.120
then we wanted to do re no.

49
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.570
Sorry.

50
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.850
Um put a gorgeous for a empty line and then go,

51
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.350
what is your name?

52
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:43.880
So now we're asking user for user input and the way the script is gonna wait for the user

53
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:52.770
input as by simply command read the read is actual command in UNIX or Lennox that will wait

54
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.650
for the user in No,

55
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.850
you have to define a variable to read.

56
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.220
So any the variable anything that user types will be automatically added to the variable.

57
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.640
And what is that variable?

58
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.150
Well,

59
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.450
you have to specify or defined every Let's say,

60
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.450
um,

61
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.480
pick any variable.

62
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.200
Let's you and I picked name,

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.370
So we'll say you know what when user put in the name put in Put that input into a container

64
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.340
into a variable and their variable name is actually name was just you know what in simple

65
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.750
words,

66
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.730
um,

67
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.650
name contain.

68
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.350
So make it easy so you don't you are not confused with name name itself.

69
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.350
No.

70
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.650
Once the usurper whites that information ah Then simply put an empty line and then do echo

71
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.650
.

72
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.450
Hello.

73
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.750
And now you put dollar name container,

74
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:07.230
which ever variable you have defined to hit her and go and that's pretty much let's give it

75
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.450
proper permissions.

76
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.000
Probably missions are there.

77
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.750
Let's run it.

78
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.430
Okay,

79
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.670
you see the first line on the screen as Hello,

80
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.250
My name is Imron absolute or your name.

81
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.650
And now it's asking you what is your name?

82
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.620
So it's waiting.

83
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.810
See,

84
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.130
you didn't get the prompt back.

85
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.560
Why?

86
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.350
Because the script is waiting for your input.

87
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.960
So let's say you want to type something.

88
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.650
Let's say,

89
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.750
um,

90
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.330
Jerry sign And now you hit Enter and it's gonna see Hello,

91
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.550
Jerry Seinfeld.

92
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.150
That's how the input and output script works.

93
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.100
Of course,

94
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.590
it gets some ah,

95
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.550
little bit more complicated as equal on,

96
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.070
but basically,

97
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.640
if you wanted to write a script and you wanted to take the input off the user.

98
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.850
You have to use a read command.

99
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.790
Now let's edit the same script at a few more things in the script and make make it more,

100
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.250
um,

101
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.660
professional.

102
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:25.150
Let's see V I input script and now wanted to define variable.

103
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.950
So I'll say,

104
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.110
um,

105
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.200
the variable.

106
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.650
It's a equal host name and you know,

107
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.170
host name is actual command.

108
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.150
And Lennox that will give you the host name off your system.

109
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
So I wanted to say hello.

110
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.350
My So we're name is Cellular Eight.

111
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.870
And what is that?

112
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.250
Dollar?

113
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.450
A.

114
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.280
The dollar A is a the container right here.

115
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.520
And that container is what host name that I will show you right here.

116
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.570
And then you'll say,

117
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.530
What is your name?

118
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.450
And now,

119
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.710
just for giggles?

120
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.250
I wanted to change the read it to just a different container.

121
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:22.850
I'll put B So just so clarify that don't you do not focus on the container name container

122
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.950
name could be anything.

123
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.630
So you are asking what is your name?

124
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:35.250
And the user who's gonna provide the name will be put into the container called B.

125
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.010
Now echo.

126
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.050
Hello.

127
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.550
Being and by Okay,

128
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.100
So now what we're doing,

129
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.740
we're saying,

130
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.290
is that when you run the script,

131
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.870
tell the user Hello.

132
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.270
My server name is dollar ate.

133
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.540
And what?

134
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.000
His dollar?

135
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.350
A dollar is the host name,

136
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.990
and it will print it here.

137
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.570
And what is your name?

138
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.150
And you will put in your name and it will.

139
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.650
I'll put back to your name.

140
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.350
No,

141
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.520
before I run it.

142
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.050
I just want to tell you one thing.

143
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.120
There will be error in the script.

144
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.720
Why?

145
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.650
Because when you define command,

146
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.850
would the,

147
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.250
um a variable?

148
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.390
You could run their variable.

149
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.840
If you only simply type dollar a,

150
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.690
then it will run it.

151
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:30.350
But if you try to run that variable using like eco command,

152
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:38.150
then you have to have this ticks on the side.

153
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
What are those ticks?

154
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.350
Those techs are right below your escape key.

155
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.870
Those other ticks.

156
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.300
So you have to have those.

157
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.550
But anywhere I want to take it out for now.

158
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.730
Just so you see that?

159
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.450
What do we get if he don't put those ticks in there?

160
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.450
So escape?

161
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.350
Save it.

162
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.880
No,

163
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.550
Let's run it.

164
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.890
It's his.

165
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.370
Hello.

166
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.350
My server name is host name.

167
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.350
Okay?

168
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.740
It actually took the exact name that I type.

169
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.850
It didn't think that it's a command.

170
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.850
And it now,

171
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.120
this is what is your name?

172
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.790
So I'm gonna put it Imron f cyl and is going to say hello,

173
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.250
Imron.

174
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.170
Okay,

175
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:28.790
so this part from right here to hear works this part from here to here works.

176
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.650
But I wanted to have my host name here.

177
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.210
And what is my host name?

178
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.150
My host name is my first Linux VM.

179
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.050
I wanted to have that displayed here.

180
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.590
So going back to what I was saying is,

181
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.650
if you are defining a variable and you want to run that variable with echo,

182
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:55.450
then you have to put the little tics that is right below um,

183
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.480
the escape character or escape key.

184
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.550
And also below the that little curly thing.

185
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.050
So now let's run it and see if it works.

now it gave me a second question.

263
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.300
It didn't give me the output right away.

264
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.150
Now it's waiting for me to give it all the information it wants.

266
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.850

um engineer.

268
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.550
Okay,

269
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.750
what is your favorite show?

270
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.450
Sign fell.

271
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:55.180
And now and I hit Enter because I have answered all the three questions and it will say

272
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:55.600
hello,

273
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.120
Imron.

274
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.750
Absolute.

275
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.750
Your profession engineer is awesome.

276
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.870
Seinfeld is a good show.

277
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.150
See how it works.

278
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:13.220
Now think off this now when you are installing a program or you are executing some kind off

279
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.000
script and or even if its windows or even of his Lennox.

280
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.280
Now you know that when you going through the visit and ask you questions do you want

281
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.090
installed at you?

282
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.780
Say yes.

283
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.480
No.

284
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.020
Put in your organization name.

285
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.940
Put it this.

286
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.180
You've type in your name and this and that.

287
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.160
All the information that system gathers from you,

288
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.780
it actually plugs that information inside wherever your variable is defined.

289
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.450
So that's just a simple example of that.

290
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.350
So it's like your little script visit that will take all the information,

291
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.980
and it will send it out on the screen.

292
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.140
You could also take that information and put in your database.

293
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.800
Send it out in eczema,

294
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.970
whichever the way you want.

295
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:59.160
So that's how you work with input and output scripts again,

296
00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.610
Um,

297
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.210
I will say,

298
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.240
Go ahead and keep that script long at more things to wear.

299
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.110
It had fun things to it.

300
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.760
Ah,

301
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.490
there so much you could do with it.

302
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.310
And if you wanted to share that,

303
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.750
your new creative script,

304
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.750
you might get sent me an email.

305
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.050
And I hope your script runs without any error.

306
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.290
If it If you get through any problems not to worry about it,

307
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.550
that's how we learn
