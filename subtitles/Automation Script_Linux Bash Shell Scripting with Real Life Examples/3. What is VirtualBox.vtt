what is Oracle Worship Box?

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.930
And,

3
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.380
of course,

4
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.650
why do we need to know about worship box?

5
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.630
Well,

6
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.120
for this course,

7
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.940
you do need to install sent OS Linux operating system on your computer,

8
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.200
and there are two ways you could insult.

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.530
One.

10
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.050
You could remove the existing operating system that you have on your computer.

11
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.030
Or you could install virtual box on top off your existing Windows operating system or Mac,

12
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.850
and then you could install sent Oso you This way you won't lose anything.

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.070
So basically,

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.030
a virtual box is a free and open source hyper wiser for X 86 computers currently being

15
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.650
developed by Oracle Corporation.

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.230
It insults on your existing Intel array,

17
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.630
MD based computers,

18
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.980
whether they are running Windows Macklin excess LHarris.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.400
It extends the capabilities off your existing computer so that it can run multiple

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.350
operating systems on one hardware at the same time.

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.410
Let's see how it works.

22
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.160
So you have when the hardware layer and then on top off it,

23
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.660
you install the operating system.

24
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.030
Of course,

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.860
it could be anyone.

26
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010
You have that as Windows or Mac,

27
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.260
and then you install Oracle Virtual Box.

28
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.000
It's just a A program,

29
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.530
a software that you installed on your machine like any other software that you would

30
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.990
install.

31
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.480
Once you have installed Oracle warship box,

32
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.660
then you could install the Lennox on it as a separate small version off operating system.

33
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.030
You could have windows on it,

34
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.590
or you could have Mac on it,

35
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.920
said this one.

36
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.370
This virtual box allows you to have multiple operating system on the same hardware.
