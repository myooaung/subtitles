00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
shelter.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.370
What is a show in this lesson will cover about Shell Hollow shell works and how you grown

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.810
command within the shelf or how the environment it's set up in a show.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.980
So what exactly is a show show is like a container like you know,

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.370
you have,

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.040
like a top aware in your home or any kind of containers that holds your environmental

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.890
information inside off it,

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.020
it's interfaces between users and colonels or offering systems.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.790
So you have built an operating system,

10
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.160
and then it is provided a platform you to execute commands again.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.320
Ghulam Windows is one of the platform and and now have been is offering system.

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.660
When you start up a gooey,

13
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.160
you execute commands by running.

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.350
But double clicking on a program so that go into face is your shell.

15
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.360
In Lenox.

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.690
When you don't have a gooey,

17
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.750
you are given a terminal show or cli command that is your show.

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.460
To find your show,

19
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.250
you could Aronica man like eco dollars,

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.880
dollar and zero that would tell you what shell you are in.

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.900
And you could also get a listing off all your shells in your Lennox distribution by running

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.650
the command cat at sea shells.

23
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.940
Your shell is also inside off,

24
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.280
etc.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.360
Password that is defined inside off the file you and windows.

26
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.990
Gooey is a shell in Lenox,

27
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.060
Katie Eglise a shell and let S h which is shelled Bash sector.

28
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.900
All these are the show that is provided to a user again.

29
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.670
We're looking at this diagram again,

30
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.180
and we are second from the top.

31
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.340
You'll see the application that talks to the shell and then shell talks to Colonel and

32
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.190
Colonel is the one that is telling hardware what to do.

33
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.240
Let's look,

34
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.750
look at our Lennox machine and we'll see how we could find our show.

35
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.150
Open up a terminal real quick and when you do cat.

36
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.110
So when you do echo dollar zero,

37
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.640
it tells you you are in bash So you could look at the available shell that is installed in

38
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.800
your distribution by doing cat at sea shells and tell you all the shows that are available

39
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.800
.

40
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
And when you look at Etc Password,

41
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.150
cat,

42
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.800
that seat password and you'll see in my user name,

43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.450
which is right here.

44
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.540
It tells the shell is all the way at the end that I have a defined show,

45
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.870
which has been bashed.

46
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.460
I could change the show if I want to tow a different show,

47
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.410
but I try to keep it consistent with other users so that what the shell does,

48
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.300
and we'll cover the later in the later lessons how we could talk to Shell to create scripts

49
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.570
and other things to automate our tasks.
