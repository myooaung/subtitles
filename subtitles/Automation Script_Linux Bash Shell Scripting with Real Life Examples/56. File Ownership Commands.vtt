00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
file ownership.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.210
In this lesson,

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.970
we will cover how files and directories are owned and how we could change the ownership off

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.650
those files and directories.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.150
So the file ownerships are created on user level and a group level.

6
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.470
There are two owners off a file or directory a user,

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.020
the one who creates the file or directory.

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.250
And the 2nd 1 is a group.

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.990
The user,

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.650
the group that belongs to,

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.030
If you are if you belong to two different group and permission applies.

12
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.450
That second group has a read permissions.

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.570
Or it could delete a file or directory as long as you in that group,

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.490
and you would have that right command to change.

15
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.420
File ownership has changed Own,

16
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.460
which is also known as Chief Home and Change Group.

17
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.740
C H g R P Change own changes.

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.880
The ownership off a file changed group changes the group ownership off a file recursive

19
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.550
ownership changed option.

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.490
If you are using an option with change own or change group with minus upper case are,

21
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.950
it will not only change that directory,

22
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.850
but also all the files and directories within the parent directory.

23
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.920
If you look at the example off windows Let's say we have this full dick,

24
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.810
all videos.

25
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.870
And when I click when I do right,

26
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.660
click and go to properties will see that under security.

27
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.470
This file is owned by the systems,

28
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.950
and I have so and administrator.

29
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.030
So you see these two people here?

30
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.150
These are the group and a single user.

31
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.500
One person here it's just a user.

32
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.900
And again,

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.280
the system is a group.

34
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.170
So group system and administrator owned this file or folder called Video,

35
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.900
and the user who created that folder is I have so and you see at the bottom it tells you

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.880
whether that user has read,

37
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.710
write or secure herbal permission.

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.040
You could see right here.

39
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.150
It has all the permission that we talked about in our Lennox machine.

40
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:43.160
When we log into our Lennix machine again,

41
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.710
the first thing,

42
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.390
what we do,

43
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.970
you see who we are.

44
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.850
So we are ourself.

45
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.210
See what falls or directors we have.

46
00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.660
These are all the listing off ours and directors we have now here in the 1st 2nd and hair

47
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.650
the third column.

48
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.100
The third column tells you who owns this file.

49
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.640
Let's say we go to Lisa.

50
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.340
We created this file Lisa and the person who owns this file,

51
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.160
Lisa is the user I've saw or yourself yourself.

52
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.130
In this case,

53
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:29.970
the four column right here is the group name in this case is IVs all again because I am

54
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.640
part off my own group.

55
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.190
I belonged to my own group.

56
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.870
I could change that to a different group.

57
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.850
But since I'm a regular user,

58
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.010
not a super user,

59
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.390
I won't be able to change that permission to any other group.

60
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.780
That Onley person or the only account that could change that.

61
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.640
Ah,

62
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.670
ownership is route.

63
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.520
So let's become route s you dash.

64
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:07.210
Once you log in,

65
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.270
you do P W d.

66
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.390
And here it will bring you into slash route.

67
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.990
Now remember,

68
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.290
you are not in your home.

69
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.680
Director,

70
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.330
You are in group director because you are route right now.

71
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.930
So I want you to go to your home directory.

72
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.650
Which is she remember slash home and slash or use the name.

73
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.250
It will take you to your home directory.

74
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.110
You could just to pwd to confirm and to a less minus.

75
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.840
Lt are to confirm it at the time that these are your directories and files.

76
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.450
If you wanted to change the permission off Lisa,

77
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.920
and you wanted to change it from yourself.

78
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.220
And you wanted to have this owned by route.

79
00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:04.170
What you'll do is change own and you specify the name off the user.

80
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.410
You want to change too?

81
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.250
And the name off the file,

82
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.350
Lisa.

83
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:23.330
And then when you do a less myself to your you will see right here the file is now owned by

84
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.950
route.

85
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.740
You could also do just to be more Pacific so you don't see all of the files you do unless

86
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.390
myself,

87
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.960
Lisa,

88
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.620
and you'll see here.

89
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.640
Now the file is owned by route.

90
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.510
You could do the same thing when you do ch g r p,

91
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.950
which is to change the group.

92
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.840
You could do the group.

93
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.580
Also,

94
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.550
there's another group called Route,

95
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.980
and you could do Lisa again on ducal.

96
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.850
Verify it.

97
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.280
And now you'll see this file.

98
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.250
Lisa is owned by a route,

99
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.890
and in the group who owns this file is also route.

100
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.480
Now what happened when you become yourself again?

101
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.110
How do you get out of this route account?

102
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.650
You just simply type exit.

103
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.150
You're logged out and just confirm who you are.

104
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.100
You're yourself which directory or in your in your home directory?

105
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.550
Do ls minus lt.

106
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.650
Or And you see there is this fall,

107
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.130
Lisa.

108
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.290
Now what happens if you try to delete this fall?

109
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.850
Let's see.

110
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.650
RM Lisa,

111
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.700
it will tell you.

112
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.360
Remove right.

113
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.430
Protected regular off empty file.

114
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:48.570
If you say yes and duelist my cell tr There you go.

115
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.490
It is gone.

116
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:59.090
The reason it is gone now Why is Because And you go one step back to your home directory.

117
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.580
So your home is right now is sash homes like yourself?

118
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.450
And then you go one step back.

119
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.870
You are in Just sash home and do a less my cell.

120
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.860
Here,

121
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.320
you'll see the of salt directory,

122
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.240
which is your home directory has permission off yourself to read,

123
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.890
write and execute.

124
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.920
Meaning anything inside of the director you greed you could write and that you could

125
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.170
execute to,

126
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.850
regardless,

127
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:33.330
if whoever puts the file in whoever owns the file our,

128
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.450
um who whichever groups owns that you could go ahead and still deleted.

129
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.140
Now,

130
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.660
if you try to create a file in,

131
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:53.350
let's say at sea and you go touch test file,

132
00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:01.290
it would tell you permission denied because you do not have permission to write to this

133
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.820
file.

134
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.150
How do you check that?

135
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.140
You do ls minus l slash.

136
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:13.180
You could do that or you could simply go to CD slash and do ls minus l.

137
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.820
And you'll see here is a list of all the directories that are inside of slash and the one

138
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.800
we were trying to go to is at sea.

139
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.150
If you notice it at sea is owned by route and the group is owned by route as well.

140
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.450
Now the route has the permission to write to it.

141
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.880
But what about the people who are in roots group?

142
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.860
They don't have a permission to write to it.

143
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.520
What about everybody else?

144
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.550
They don't have a permission to write to it.

145
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.790
So that is why you cannot create ah file in at sea.

146
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.670
So let's let's say,

147
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.110
if you become root again,

148
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:58.440
okay?

149
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.050
And now you go to etc.

150
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:07.680
And you create a file touch test 123 It's verified.

151
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.150
A list minus L t r.

152
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.500
You see,

153
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.210
the bottom is your file.

154
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.020
Now another way.

155
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.460
What you could do is while we're working on this,

156
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:22.700
you can minimize this window and you could open another window by right clicking and clear

157
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:22.700
,

158
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.860
open Terminal said.

159
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.960
This way we have a regular account which is our account and the root account.

160
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.410
So there.

161
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:35.060
So if you don't have to exit out of a rule account So we are here.

162
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.580
I have solved which director of urine,

163
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.660
urine slash home and we created the filed in etc.

164
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.800
Right as a route.

165
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.030
So let's go to etc.

166
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.750
And let's see ls minus l to your.

167
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:53.510
And now we're going to try to remove this fall test 123 and it's gonna see it removed,

168
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:53.830
Right,

169
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.500
protected.

170
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.460
It's just a warning.

171
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.010
You said yes and it stills his permission denied.

172
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.280
Now why?

173
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.490
It's saying permission denied again.

174
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:09.850
You go to a CD slash name and you do ls minus l and you will see right here.

175
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.700
That's the at sea directory and it's tell you right here.

176
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:21.130
The Group three bets do not have write permission and the other three bits do not have

177
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.650
write permission as well.

178
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:30.170
So that's how you change these user of the files ownership and group ownerships that the

179
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.410
two commands that we learn is chief ownership,

180
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.350
which is C.

181
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.070
H o and w Sorry.

182
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:39.590
Ow!

183
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:46.650
And And the 2nd 1 has changed group so again really want you to do a man on each command

184
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.120
and go over the description,

185
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.280
The different options it has same thing you do with the with the second command as well.

186
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.300
And also,

187
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:03.770
I want you to practice this command by changing the permission Onley in your home directory

188
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:03.770
.

189
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:10.920
So your home directory is slash home slash yourself and you could try changing permission

190
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.040
to one of the directory,

191
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.330
like create a new fall.

192
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:22.230
Don't testify that you created and just see permission test file create this while and just

193
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.730
