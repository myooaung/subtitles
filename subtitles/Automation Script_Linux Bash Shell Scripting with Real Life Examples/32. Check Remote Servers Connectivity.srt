1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Hey,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,590
everyone here is another newer scripted.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,550
We will go where it's about checking the other server connectivity.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,010
Of course,

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,930
you need to know all the time.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,420
If you are in a bigger environment,

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,850
you need to know if your other servers are actually reachable and paying global.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,070
Now,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,990
I know there are a lot of monitoring solutions that that are out there that,

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,350
um a lot of companies have the actually,

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,080
those are monitor the servers,

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,380
they monitor the health check and everything.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,380
But still,

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,300
once in a while,

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:49,290
you do need to actually paying other servers a remote servers that actually tells you if

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,700
they are alive or they are down.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,880
So this lesson is about pinging of the servers.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,390
Ah,

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,020
what we're gonna do is we actually gonna create a script to check the status off the remote

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,440
host or hosts.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,160
Um,

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,050
and we'll find out if it is payable or not.

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,820
Very simple script we actually have to combine in this group.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,870
We have this combined.

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,400
Um,

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,280
if ah else ah state man's view might we will have to actually combine do wild statement

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,910
together,

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,350
and you will see how we could pink other servers.

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,450
Um I have a Mullinix machine open.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,050
And I also have a quick document here.

31
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,080
You could say a cheat sheet,

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,270
which already I have a script written there,

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,030
because if I go over completely blank with you,

34
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,000
I might forget,

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,670
and I might lose time.

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,580
And I definitely don't want to do that.

37
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,050
I definitely want to lose my time and your time.

38
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,880
So anyway,

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,720
the first thing I want to do is I do want to mention one thing that,

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,560
um,

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,630
previously be actually created.

42
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,150
Um,

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,540
a directory called professional Scripts.

44
00:01:59,540 --> 00:01:59,960
Now,

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,440
I noticed this whole directory is a very long directory.

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,550
Let's make it short.

47
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,470
So this way it will be easier to actually change,

48
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,770
actually from one place to another.

49
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,410
So I'm gonna just do move professional directory scripts,

50
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:13,850
too.

51
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,890
Um,

52
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,400
PS this simple is that now you'll see I have a doctor called PS when I goto PS,

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,950
which stands for professional scripts.

54
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,870
And now I have all my scripts.

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,380
So just to start off with that now,

56
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,290
let's start creating our first group that is going to Ping an I P address.

57
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,640
Now,

58
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,690
the I P address that I have selected is the I.

59
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,860
P address off my home modem,

60
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,550
which is one night to 1 68 $1.1.

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,960
And most likely if you are in a home environment,

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,290
not in the office than your I P address is the same as 1 91 61 That one.

63
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,880
If it is not the same,

64
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,260
then you could go find out the default gave a i p just to test if you could Pinkett or not

65
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,260
,

66
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,390
Or you could just pink.

67
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,150
Or you could just pick any I p that you could,

68
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,850
um,

69
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,290
test your script against.

70
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,850
So I have picked 19 to 1 $61.

71
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,150
One.

72
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,250
This is my i p that I'm gonna test.

73
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,150
Um,

74
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,150
So let's first create a script,

75
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,850
and I'm gonna call the script Ping.

76
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,230
Okay?

77
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,950
And this is the first time I will copy,

78
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,200
then later on.

79
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:47,450
So I'm just gonna quickly do the information date description this script.

80
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,200
Well,

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,500
ping a remote host and notify,

82
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,050
of course,

83
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,000
Then,

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,650
um,

85
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,750
modified.

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:08,350
And since this is the first time and I the okay,

87
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,000
now,

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,980
let's get into the real work now to be defined their variable.

89
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,250
Now,

90
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,050
Ping,

91
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:21,700
I'm sure you guys know what a pink script is pink goes out on the remote host Ping An I p.

92
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,050
Address and tell you if,

93
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,120
um,

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,790
host is available or not.

95
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,220
So let me just right Quit out of this script.

96
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,150
Make sure you save it.

97
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,060
And just if you don't know Ping than just typing one I to 1 68 that one.

98
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,530
That one.

99
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,480
And you will see you are getting 64.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,730
Bite back from this.

101
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,320
This machine,

102
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,100
it means there is a machine out there with that i p address and it is reaching anyway.

103
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,450
So now let's go back to our So what we are trying to do with the scriptures you want a ping

104
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:09,580
minus c is count just Ping once the i p one I too once 1 68 1.1 now you as you go along,

105
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,840
you're probably thinking,

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,620
Hey,

107
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,830
how come m Ron knows all those different options to specify How can he remembers How can he

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,470
just pick really quick?

109
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,270
Well,

110
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,070
to be honest,

111
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,330
I don't remember there many times.

112
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,190
I just go online,

113
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,910
I google it and and I get the options.

114
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,340
So if I wanted to Google paying only once all type paying only ones in Shell script or Ping

115
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,140
only once.

116
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Um,

117
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,920
remote host.

118
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,950
And it will give me the option that I'm looking,

119
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,410
so don't worry about it.

120
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,620
You're You're not the one that you're thinking.

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,000
Hey,

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,070
my memory sucks.

123
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,050
I'm not gonna remember that.

124
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,790
Trust me,

125
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,050
my memory is probably worse than yours,

126
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,650
so don't worry about it.

127
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,250
If you forget anything,

128
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,780
go online and search for it,

129
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,350
and you will get it As long as you type exactly what you're I'm moving forward.

130
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,910
So we are paying this.

131
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,710
I p alright.

132
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,350
It will ping Evil Ping one time.

133
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,880
Perfect.

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,900
Now what will happen?

135
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,960
What are you trying to do when it pinks?

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,510
Okay,

137
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:23,240
we're trying to say is if single bracket dollar question more now,

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,470
what is a dollar question Mark Dollar question Mark is the output off all the command that

139
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,060
you run by default?

140
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,950
The dollar?

141
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,980
Um,

142
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,830
question mark returns to well,

143
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,480
use one is zero,

144
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,450
which is that Yes,

145
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,750
it,

146
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,710
um it ran successfully or anything else.

147
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,810
So these are the exit status.

148
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,770
Um,

149
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,900
if you don't know differences between exit status,

150
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,650
you could look it up,

151
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,180
but there are mostly to exist.

152
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,150
Added that I you leave,

153
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,970
um,

154
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,870
rely on eggs.

155
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,850
Status one and two.

156
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,950
So dollar question mark.

157
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,710
If the return off my command above,

158
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:13,850
which is ping minus C one d I p address is equal 20 Okay.

159
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,250
To see if the return value is equal to zero.

160
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,280
Which means it did run.

161
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,050
It was successful then.

162
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,250
Since we are if else dense statements,

163
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,290
we have to specified then tab,

164
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,520
As I said previously,

165
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,420
always put tabs so it will look neat and clean.

166
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,050
Then what do you want to do?

167
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,110
You know,

168
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,370
the pink is successful,

169
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,960
The host is reasonable,

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,860
and what you want to do will simply se Um Okay,

171
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,350
How's that?

172
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,450
Process him.

173
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,830
All right.

174
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,350
Perfect.

175
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,800
Now what if you don't get zero of status,

176
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,950
which is camping it that what you want to do and is what else?

177
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,990
If that doesn't work,

178
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,800
then what else else?

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,110
Echo?

180
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,250
Not okay,

181
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,750
Right.

182
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,250
So if I do this else do that,

183
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,650
okay.

184
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,080
Perfect.

185
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,500
Now,

186
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,800
every time you start,

187
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:29,250
if you have to end it with he and that's pretty much save your script,

188
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:39,100
give at execute permissions to your script and now run the scripless created screen and all

189
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,320
Run,

190
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,950
run the script.

191
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,850
Perfect.

192
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,090
You see,

193
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,360
it ran and it ran one time and it came back.

194
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,350
It was successful.

195
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,200
Statistics came back.

196
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
One packet transmitted.

197
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,350
This is all part off pings group.

198
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,650
So we came back.

199
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,900
The exit status was zero,

200
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,140
which means it run.

201
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,560
And that's why I said,

202
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,650
And that's why the script said it was okay.

203
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,550
Perfect.

204
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,770
Now,

205
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,490
what if I give an I P address,

206
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,770
so I'll change my I p address right here.

207
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,550
I have specified right here again.

208
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,550
I'm gonna change the i p address to one I to 1 61 to 35.

209
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,330
Now,

210
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,290
how do I get that I p address?

211
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,330
I just paying some off the i P address in my home network.

212
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,050
I'm sure,

213
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,730
um,

214
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,900
if you're in the home network,

215
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,320
your I p addresses are probably used from to to,

216
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,520
like,

217
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,000
15 or 20 at least because we have so many gadgets at home.

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,050
But it's very highly unlikely that you're probably gonna be at 235 eyepiece.

219
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:52,450
So what I did is before I picked that I p I just simply pinned that I p Okay.

220
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,160
Do you see I paying that i p and that I p is not reachable.

221
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,850
So that's why I just picked that I p you could pick any I p That is not painful either.

222
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,550
So I'm gonna go into back into my screen,

223
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:12,050
and this time I'm gonna change the I P two instead of $1.1.

224
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,850
I'm gonna change it 2 to 35 and save it.

225
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,030
And now,

226
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,970
when I run it,

227
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,190
what should I get camping?

228
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,080
Get right and it's gonna come back and is going to say not.

229
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,850
Okay.

230
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,520
See,

231
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,700
that's how the F L script works.

232
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,280
And to ping other hosts of the devices.

233
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,080
That is something that you will definitely definitely will be working on.

234
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,250
I'm sure if you are in system administrator or engineer or any kind of role,

235
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,250
you probably would have to do that.

236
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,160
Now,

237
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,350
Next one is if you notice right here.

238
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,810
I have this output coming in that I put it's gonna give me that ping,

239
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,830
and then it will give me the not OK.

240
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,080
Now,

241
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,840
what if I just I'm just concerned that don't show me anything.

242
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,220
Just tell me if it is okay,

243
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,250
and if it's not OK,

244
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,330
so what would we do here?

245
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,250
as I have written down here,

246
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,490
you could output cause right here and you do paying it out,

247
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,450
Put to the screen.

248
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,080
If you do not want that to be output on the screen,

249
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,650
then there is this.

250
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,370
Ah,

251
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,220
Syntex,

252
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,650
um that you have to specify its is and percent quicker than sign.

253
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,060
And Deb No,

254
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,580
it means that you are out.

255
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,850
Putting it to a definable definable is just a file in Lenox.

256
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,140
It's ah,

257
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,980
no file.

258
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,910
Every time you throw anything on definable,

259
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,150
it will just disappear.

260
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,650
That's how it is.

261
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,270
And I'm very hopeful.

262
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,740
You probably heard of that as well.

263
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,050
So I'm gonna go back into my pink scrip.

264
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,350
And this time I am going to tell it that you know what?

265
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:01,230
Don't throw messages on the screen.

266
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,100
I don't care about the message.

267
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,100
All I care about is what is the outcome?

268
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,850
Is it okay or is it not OK?

269
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,990
No,

270
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,340
I will run it if you see.

271
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,560
No,

272
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,490
let me clear the screen.

273
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,650
So you will see it will come up very nice and neat and clean.

274
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,800
She's not doing all those messages.

275
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,250
All I'm gonna get is not okay.

276
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,140
That's what I care about so many times.

277
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,700
You don't really want to see all that junk on the screen because that will not only confuse

278
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,040
you,

279
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,610
but I will take your time to actually read through it.

280
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,080
And what exactly you're looking for?

281
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,750
So if I change the i p back to one,

282
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,350
then I should get okay simply and straightforward.

283
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,750
Just okay.

284
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,150
Perfect.

285
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,050
Now,

286
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,840
next thing I want to cover is what if you want to define that,

287
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,950
I pee in a very meaning.

288
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,600
You put that I pee in front off a variable.

289
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,850
So instead of just pinging the straight i p you paying the variable,

290
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,650
Why do I do that?

291
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,280
Because many times you do want to add multiple host or you know,

292
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,270
certain things that you want to um you want you probably wanted to paying multiple times,

293
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,750
Then you don't want to specify Be again and again and again,

294
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,550
you just specify one time,

295
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,150
and then they do the host to itself.

296
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,490
So I'm gonna go back to into pings.

297
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:28,750
Quit.

298
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,380
And now I'm gonna put invariable right here,

299
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,560
and variable I'm gonna do is host um,

300
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,750
equal sign coat 1 90 to 1 68.1 dot one close desk,

301
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,450
my variable.

302
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,010
Now,

303
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,740
instead of paying the I p,

304
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,150
what I'm gonna say is paying the host and dollar host,

305
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,550
right?

306
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,220
And this time I'm gonna make my script a little fence here.

307
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,150
I'm gonna say,

308
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,810
if ping this host,

309
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,540
which is this with this variable and I'll put to a definable if the output it's successful

310
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:10,540
,

311
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,070
then okay,

312
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,330
instead of just okay,

313
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:20,450
I'm gonna say didn't say hosts the I p is okay is okay.

314
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,500
And else if that is not Ping Global,

315
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,750
then hosts is not okay.

316
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,150
You see,

317
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,300
I use my variable so efficiently.

318
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,820
Now,

319
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,200
I is used in three different in three different places.

320
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,250
I don't have to specify i p here.

321
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,290
Um,

322
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:39,610
sorry,

323
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,660
i p here.

324
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,350
I don't have to specify I p here.

325
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,230
I don't have to specify i p here I have specified the i p just one time as a variable right

326
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,330
here and now I'm just gonna use that variable as or that container,

327
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,950
and I'm gonna use it again and again and again.

328
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,520
Okay,

329
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,170
so let's run it nice,

330
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,550
right?

331
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,170
I p That I'm trying to ping is okay.

332
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,190
So now it's very pacific.

333
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,180
There's telling me that this is the I p that you're trying to ping,

334
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,900
and it is okay not to worry about it.

335
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,340
Now,

336
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:20,800
what if I change the i p 2 to 35 which is,

337
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,350
of course,

338
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,030
one of my p.

339
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,050
That is not thinkable.

340
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,750
That is not a sign.

341
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,400
And now let's clear the screen so we could see better Pinks.

342
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,350
He's gonna ping.

343
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,050
And the reason it takes a little longer because sometimes pain just waits for it to respond

344
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,050
.

345
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,420
It's by default.

346
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,870
It's just waits for it anyway.

347
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,280
So you see,

348
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,800
it came back.

349
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,850
It says one night to 1 61 to 35 is not okay.

350
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,660
Perfect.

351
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,760
See how we actually made the Jews off variable here and the use If an l statements and the

352
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,700
are putting the variables in place,

353
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,710
I'll gain.

354
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,140
Um,

355
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,310
Now,

356
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,430
next one is changing.

357
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,550
I p already did that.

358
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,750
Perfect.

359
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,280
Now,

360
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,350
the next one is a little complicated one,

361
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,950
But it's easy if you do it together.

362
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,200
Okay.

363
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,250
Now what if you wanted toe Ping multiple I ps in one screw.

364
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,140
Okay.

365
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,380
One I p I coping.

366
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,820
Get right.

367
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,580
I could I don't even have to create a script hoping that.

368
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,250
Right?

369
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,730
I understand you're probably thinking that,

370
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,700
but the reason we start off with one eye piece.

371
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,760
So you would understand what if you want to ping 100 servers now where things get

372
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,540
interesting now,

373
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,450
you really need to have that script,

374
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,450
right?

375
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,150
Look,

376
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,940
So,

377
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,630
first of all,

378
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:44,900
what you need to do is you need to put that I p addresses that you wanted to paying to.

379
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,570
Ah,

380
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,150
file.

381
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,440
So I'm gonna create a while.

382
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,890
I'm gonna call it,

383
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:58,960
um um my hosts and I'm gonna put in the I p address.

384
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
You want me to 1 68 1 That one.

385
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,080
And the 2nd 1 I'm gonna put it 19 to 1 68 I wonder so now,

386
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,950
since we're working on only two eyepiece,

387
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,430
if you have multiple happens,

388
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,050
you want to try?

389
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,450
Please go ahead.

390
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:11,950
No.

391
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,350
Safe.

392
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,160
Now,

393
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,740
this is just an empty file.

394
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,080
Sorry.

395
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,160
This is just a flat file.

396
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,080
And let's do my host,

397
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,920
and you'll see it has I P address.

398
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,400
Now,

399
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,130
instead of changing the existing script,

400
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,150
I am going to create a new script.

401
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,840
And of course,

402
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,950
I'm not gonna create a new script from scratch.

403
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,050
What?

404
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,840
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just copy my pink script and I'm gonna name it Ping Script Dash

405
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,290
All.

406
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:43,160
So this way it will identify that this is for all multiple INEC service Multiple host.

407
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,470
Now the I Ping script Dash all you see,

408
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,870
everything here is done,

409
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,250
but I just have to change the description says Describable Ping I remote host,

410
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,050
not more host Must apple her more hosts.

411
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,140
Make sure you change.

412
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,950
This description is very important.

413
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,850
Okay,

414
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,420
now we're gonna come in,

415
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,850
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna simply,

416
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,320
um You know what?

417
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,950
Let's first get rid off this variable host.

418
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,600
And that started from here.

419
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,370
What are those?

420
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,920
Host.

421
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:29,350
So this is the variable and variables is what you have to specify the location off your

422
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,760
file.

423
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,450
That is slash home.

424
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,410
I saw slash ps ps for professional scripts.

425
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:39,710
Remember?

426
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,260
We did that.

427
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,480
And B,

428
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,350
what was the name re picked for the flat file?

429
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,550
Was it hosts?

430
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,720
Um,

431
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,390
not sure,

432
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,760
actually.

433
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,110
Let me go check.

434
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,550
So please make sure this location and this host vial is correct.

435
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,050
Otherwise,

436
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,350
the script was gonna complaint.

437
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,010
No,

438
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,600
I specified my host and it is home.

439
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,550
I have soapy hysteric My house.

440
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,160
Okay,

441
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,750
Perfect.

442
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,060
So now here is the location of the file that has all my multiple host.

443
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,500
Okay,

444
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,900
Perfect.

445
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,450
Now I wanted to use four loop for that.

446
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,450
Why?

447
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,510
Acres four loop allows you to go through the script.

448
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:36,160
Wants twice or as many times until everything is being read or everything has been

449
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,260
satisfied.

450
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,070
So if I don't specify four loop,

451
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,020
what will happen is it will first I pienza list and it will be done.

452
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,950
It's not gonna go through the second i p.

453
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,350
That's why we have to specify for Luke.

454
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,660
Four i p.

455
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,320
Now why I picked I p i p is just a container again.

456
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,180
It's just a variable.

457
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:08,760
You could just pick anything for I p in and dollar parentheses And where Yeah,

458
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,850
specify dollar hosts.

459
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,760
Okay,

460
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,590
now you see what I did for I p I'm putting.

461
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm creating a container.

462
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,110
Another container I pee in and I'm catting this at sea host fall.

463
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,080
What is Sorry?

464
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,990
Not sus What?

465
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,690
I'm carrying this dollar Horse files.

466
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
What is dollar host?

467
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:35,970
Father?

468
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,240
Daughter?

469
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,950
Whose fault is that?

470
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,790
Oh,

471
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,160
my abs.

472
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
LPs mild.

473
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:48,420
So this is what I'm telling for I p in put everything that comes from this result cat host

474
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,060
Put everything in i p All right,

475
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,850
perfect child.

476
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,350
Now what else you wanted?

477
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,260
No do.

478
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,540
Because you have to specify what,

479
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,110
exactly?

480
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,830
Once you do,

481
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,580
four always has to have a do four do done for a while do Okay,

482
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,300
so four.

483
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,050
Ok,

484
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,660
now what do you want to do?

485
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,330
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move this one tab,

486
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,520
or I'm gonna say Ping see one same thing.

487
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,460
And now instead,

488
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,760
off host I wanted to do I p because right here,

489
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,140
this is I p right.

490
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,070
This is the container.

491
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,550
I'm specifying it right here.

492
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,080
Now you're probably thinking,

493
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,340
Hey,

494
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,710
Enron,

495
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,850
why can't I just use the same variable?

496
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,810
Hmm.

497
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,860
That's a good question.

498
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,320
I don't know.

499
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,870
Try it.

500
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,550
Maybe it was,

501
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,980
but this is how I actually,

502
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,470
um,

503
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,850
go through my practice.

504
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,450
And if you want to try it,

505
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,150
please be my guest.

506
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,470
Tried?

507
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,000
If it works.

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,450
Perfect.

509
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,380
All right.

510
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,660
So I p okay.

511
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,170
Going into debt.

512
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,790
Not now.

513
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,450
Coming back to our same script.

514
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:04,760
If pound a dollar question mark equals zero then and set a host now you're king about I p I

515
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,550
p is put it there.

516
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,380
Pink pass.

517
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,550
I'll just keep leave it as is I p is okay.

518
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,780
And the same thing here I p is not so,

519
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,420
by the way,

520
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,760
this file that I am looking at it,

521
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,900
I will I will attach that file with this lesson.

522
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,630
So you have to worry about it.

523
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,260
You could also copy paste if you make a mistake.

524
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,160
Sometimes when you were writing the script many times I would say even 80% of 85% of times

525
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,330
you make mistakes.

526
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,540
I make mistakes too.

527
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,660
That's why I try to write it so there won't be any mistakes.

528
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,810
Okay,

529
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,350
so this is how he's gonna do again.

530
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,840
So hopefully you understand what I'm trying to get at this is the variable and what

531
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,850
variables going to do?

532
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,690
It's going to specify the name fire.

533
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,350
Okay,

534
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,040
Now,

535
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,030
for I p,

536
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,510
this is another variable.

537
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,470
And it's saying that you know what?

538
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,950
Go and read that file cat that fall.

539
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,520
And that file is that he just dollar host.

540
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,970
I don't know why I keep saying that.

541
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,590
See hoses just so used to it sitting etc host anyway.

542
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:10,880
Ok,

543
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,850
do Ping.

544
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:20,070
That whatever is inside of cast cat host and to go through the same scenario.

545
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,370
Now,

546
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,030
another thing.

547
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't forget at the bottom.

548
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,790
When you have do,

549
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,550
what do you have to have done?

550
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,360
Same thing.

551
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,450
If you have fee,

552
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,660
you have to have.

553
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,270
Sorry if you have.

554
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,160
If you have to have,

555
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,330
See if you have do you have to have done all right?

556
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,850
Perfect.

557
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,950
Now let's run it.

558
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,060
That's very five.

559
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,160
You have it Could be do Ping.

560
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
Oh,

561
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,930
enter when I did 1 60 to $1.1 is okay.

562
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,850
And 1 90 to 1 61 to 35 is not okay.

563
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,550
You see how it works?

564
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:04,790
So that's how you could actually create a script that will have a multiple i p address or

565
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,140
multiple host name and that you want to ping.

566
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,720
And,

567
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,100
of course,

568
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:14,090
if you want to run disks script at a Cron job could try that,

569
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,850
but we'll cover that later as well.

570
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,730
So this focus on this one and try it.

571
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,490
And if you if you could seriously try to do it Cron job that will automatically run a

572
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,070
certain time,

573
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,480
try it.

574
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,160
It will work.

575
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,050
Good luck
