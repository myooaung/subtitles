1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
are less.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,530
Next lesson is about listing users who have logged in,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,250
Let's say,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,850
for example,

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,430
today or any Pacific Day.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,440
So what happened is you.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,830
Let's say your manager comes.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,620
It comes to you and ask you Hey,

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,270
Imron,

10
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,650
can you give me a list of all the users who have logged in today?

11
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,440
And if they are logged into former Pacific machine from a Pacific I p or even,

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,870
um,

13
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,650
you could say,

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:29,910
Hey,

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,350
can you give me a list of users who logged in on July 25th?

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,370
Then what would happen?

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,850
You have to actually go in,

18
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,540
uh,

19
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,250
get for,

20
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:38,850
um,

21
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,810
the right command look for the right options and the right,

22
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,510
um,

23
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,620
piping commands.

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,150
And then you run the command.

25
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,200
So what if you already have a script that does this type of job for you?

26
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,590
And you know that your manager is gonna come back to you and ask you the same thing,

27
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,200
probably like two or three times Ah,

28
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,310
week or months,

29
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,050
and then you need to create a script so well,

30
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,950
create the script for our managers so he'll be happy.

31
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,250
So let's go directly into our machine,

32
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,630
and I am by the way.

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,780
Ah,

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,350
What the script is gonna do is it's gonna look for users who are logged in today.

35
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,150
That's a first script of you'll,

36
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,950
right?

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,260
The second,

38
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,830
what it will do is but in the same script,

39
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,230
we'll do as we will add the user input.

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,260
Meaning we will ask the user.

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,690
Okay.

42
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,160
You want me to get a list of all the users,

43
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,400
but do you want to get it for a Pacific Day or Pacific month?

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,050
So we will give that option,

45
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:44,600
give the leverage to the user so they simply and put the month or date,

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,850
and it will get them.

47
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,530
That output sounds,

48
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,100
um,

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,110
found entrusting.

50
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,350
Right,

51
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,550
So we'll try that.

52
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,390
All right,

53
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,560
let's go back to our machine.

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,810
And again,

55
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,400
you're logged in as ourself,

56
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,650
which direct you you're in.

57
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,950
Let's go to our Profession Scripts directory.

58
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,850
And I am going to named this script list.

59
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,450
Uses.

60
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,940
Okay.

61
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,250
Ah,

62
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,050
regular drill.

63
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:24,450
Define are variable or water date.

64
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,230
I'm gonna leave to date out.

65
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,660
You could put it in description.

66
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:41,640
This script will list uses love and by modified two.

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,680
And we'll leave that out.

68
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,050
I know you're export now.

69
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,950
Okay,

70
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,850
So the first thing that will do is,

71
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,650
um,

72
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,350
no.

73
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,250
Before I write anything,

74
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,340
let's write and quit out of this.

75
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,050
Save it.

76
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,890
And if you wanted to get a list of users by day,

77
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,370
what do you do?

78
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,970
You do run last command,

79
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,250
right?

80
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:08,040
You hit enter and you get all those ah users on the first column and the machine there.

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,270
Ah,

82
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,270
terminal at the time And the which date they logged in the time and they're still logged in

83
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,630
or not.

84
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,150
If you do,

85
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,940
let's see.

86
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,330
Last you'll see,

87
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,630
these are all the machines user log damage from all the machine the time they're logged in

88
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,630
.

89
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,950
So we wanted to know the list of fuses by the day.

90
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,000
So the command he ran already,

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,230
right.

92
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,080
But we need you don't need all that stuff we need to simple users.

93
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,830
So we have to modify our command,

94
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,040
right?

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,150
So it will be last,

96
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,150
and then we will do.

97
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,850
Um that's it.

98
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,920
Um um,

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,150
grip for like,

100
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,850
let's say Monday,

101
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,950
so it will give us all the Monday in everything.

102
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,800
But we also wanted to make sure that,

103
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,220
um,

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,150
it actually goes by the dates.

105
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,540
If I If if I mind my manager says.

106
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,050
Give me all the list of users that logged in today,

107
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,690
so I know I could run that command.

108
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,710
And I know today's date right,

109
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,580
and I could just simply grow up for that.

110
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,220
But what if I want the script to run automatically,

111
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,350
then the script needs to know what today's date is,

112
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,040
and for it to find out you'll have to run the day command and then you could do is simply

113
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,550
grab for this date.

114
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,980
It's a Friday,

115
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,580
August 31st and then sorry.

116
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,730
First you type the last command and then grab for that Pacific date,

117
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,310
and it will give you only their uses for that Pacific date,

118
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,680
right?

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,600
That's how you do it.

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
But again,

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,250
script doesn't know what date is today.

122
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,590
So script has to run the command date to find today's date and Parsons and then put that

123
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,240
into the script.

124
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,450
So to do that will get back to our script,

125
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,550
which is list uses,

126
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:57,750
and here first we'll do is we'll define the very that what is today's date said today equal

127
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:57,750
,

128
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,660
and we put the tick tickles comes before the date of for the command,

129
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,050
said date talk,

130
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,950
dollar one people on money,

131
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,250
daughter to dollar through.

132
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,570
This is what we want and take again to close it.

133
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,790
But what exactly this command is doing?

134
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,050
So let's copy this command,

135
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,850
save our script and running.

136
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,840
See,

137
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,460
It's giving you the 1st 3 field.

138
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,750
So if you just type date,

139
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,260
give you the three field the time the e d t.

140
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,370
Which is the zone,

141
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,550
the year and bunch of information.

142
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,250
So you don't want to get all that information.

143
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,450
You just want the 1st 3 columns so you could grow up against these cars.

144
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,900
So we already defined that in our ah command,

145
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,550
and it will pick only first recall.

146
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,650
Let's get back to our list of fuses.

147
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,650
We already defined that we put in a variable and variable is called today.

148
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:12,400
Now we will do is we'll do last,

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,140
which is to actually run the command and we want to corrupt for what you want to grab for

150
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,150
our vary and variable is what today.

151
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,450
So basically what saying is run the last command and grab for the variable and variable Is

152
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:43,430
this so this is what is going to do and now let's run it permissions Hmm Okay,

153
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,960
You see what is happening here?

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,010
It's saying August,

155
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,750
No such file directory 31st.

156
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,690
No such file directory.

157
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,450
Why is happening?

158
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,240
Let me tell you why.

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,660
Okay,

160
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,050
so let's do the cat off the script.

161
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,000
You see,

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,250
it's when you run this command,

163
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,750
it gives you the information,

164
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,530
which is Friday,

165
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,850
August 31st and we are passing this output to the group.

166
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,980
But when you do this this passing off information off grip and then you do this entire

167
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,310
thing,

168
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,760
then the corrupt doesn't know which to grab for.

169
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,570
It has to grow for Friday or August or 31st.

170
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,220
So we have to put that in coats.

171
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,750
So the great would know that this whole thing is one string.

172
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,750
Then it'll grow up.

173
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:38,250
So you have to modify our script the same way list and we will put the coat around our very

174
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,940
perfect.

175
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,050
Now let's clear the screen.

176
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,950
Let's run it again.

177
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,850
And this time it is giving me,

178
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,990
Ah,

179
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,770
the users that been logged in today.

180
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,730
So system will find out today state and it will grow up for that.

181
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,030
Today's So this is our first group that I mentioned that we wanted to Do you have the list

182
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,190
submitted to your to your manager?

183
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,500
And if the manager only wants to user,

184
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,100
you could modify your script by doing list and instead,

185
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,950
off last and grew up today you could just do sorry.

186
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,850
Talk it to what Column?

187
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,050
Number one,

188
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,090
Cause you don't want all that stuff that comes with it right now.

189
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,850
Let's run it and you only get the uses.

190
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,080
And that's what he or she wants to get the list for,

191
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,350
right?

192
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,090
No.

193
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,900
Next thing is,

194
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,910
we want to create a script that will ask the user input to pull a user.

195
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,970
So what if you have the script in which,

196
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,050
which the script knows that I'm gonna pull users that logged in today?

197
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,850
Only by deep.

198
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,030
But now we want to give the power to the user,

199
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,750
said the user will define its own,

200
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,850
um,

201
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,710
its own variable or its own choices.

202
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's put it this So for that will go back into our Lennox ah list user script and what

203
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,430
we'll do is we leave everything as is and no sorry,

204
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,270
we will actually have to REM or because this one actually is for today,

205
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,250
and we we don't want to grow up for today,

206
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,550
and you will get rid of this one as well.

207
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,790
So you know what the best thing is?

208
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,350
Instead of deleting this removing this oops has quit out if it and just copy it Lists user

209
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:52,260
by in That's a six apps issues by and okay,

210
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,270
so now this is now we come on.

211
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:54,360
Who?

212
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,500
It?

213
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,910
This way.

214
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,550
We could leave the previous script as is and modify the new one.

215
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:12,050
So let's get rid of So a description discovered less users logged in by date or now play

216
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:22,050
users.

217
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,040
Okay,

218
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,300
So first thing is,

219
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,780
it has to ask the user what you're looking for.

220
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,150
So whenever you need to ask you,

221
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,860
is that what you have to do?

222
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,950
You have to display the message on the screen to display the message on the screen is echo

223
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:37,950
,

224
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,670
and I'll put coat hair because I'm gonna put parentheses.

225
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,850
So please,

226
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,260
and to day now,

227
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,330
put parentheses,

228
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,150
for example,

229
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,610
Monday because I have to let the user know the example,

230
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,040
and I'm putting parentheses.

231
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,700
That's where you when you put parentheses an echo,

232
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,070
then I think you would have to put in coat,

233
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,260
but you could try without code.

234
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,150
Hopefully works.

235
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,640
But anyway,

236
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,550
just to be sure.

237
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,050
Okay,

238
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,650
so now you have to read the so you do D As for days,

239
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,920
echo is to put an empty line.

240
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,050
Next one you need to ask is please enter month,

241
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,850
for example August.

242
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,390
That's how it these s go again.

243
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,650
Just put empty line.

244
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:39,350
So not read because we have to read the read I m is a very a month bill.

245
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,850
Another echo.

246
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:54,850
Now you have to ask into the question please enter date for example 28.

247
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,850
Okay,

248
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,320
Read the date.

249
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,350
Devi already have a variable for its of a podium.

250
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,050
Okay,

251
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,450
so we have asked all these questions,

252
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:15,220
but a quick are We have asked all the questions and we have added those questions into our

253
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,750
very now What do you want to do next?

254
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:27,950
Next we wanted to do is run the command last and grip for coat,

255
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,540
dollar,

256
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:29,950
D,

257
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,150
dollar and dollar.

258
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,950
You see how it is going to grip it?

259
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,950
It is going to grow up the entered month the entered.

260
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,850
So I entered a into mountain and to date and we'll put that variables here and I'll grab it

261
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,050
from the last.

262
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,150
That's run it,

263
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,260
and we'll see how it works.

264
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,730
List uses by please Enter day.

265
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,290
Perfect.

266
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,250
Put in,

267
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,280
um,

268
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,360
Monday,

269
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,150
as it say,

270
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,350
Please enter month.

271
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,850
It's a August,

272
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,250
please,

273
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,660
and to date put 20 and it stays.

274
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:23,510
There is no user that actually has logged in that day to verify our script runs.

275
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,950
Let's run just last command just to see if there's actual users who work.

276
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,250
So we'll pick.

277
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,650
Um,

278
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,240
Sunday,

279
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,250
August 26th.

280
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,640
Uh,

281
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,650
let me clear this.

282
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,970
So your seat,

283
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,250
please.

284
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,350
Sunday,

285
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,860
August 26.

286
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,920
So we know for sure that this is the day month that someone in my machine or I have logged

287
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,050
in.

288
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,560
So when I hit enter now it's giving me All the users have been logged in to my linens

289
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,860
machine on this date again.

290
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,950
If you wanted to just view the list of users,

291
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,380
not the whole information.

292
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,300
What do you have to do is you just put it at the end.

293
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,150
You put it off dollar one,

294
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:26,950
and this way it will only give you the users clear the screen.

295
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,340
It's run it again,

296
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,500
less user by,

297
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,050
and he's and to date Sunday,

298
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,050
August 26 perfect.

299
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,940
This is what we wanted to know.

300
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,960
And you could just simply copy and paste it to your email and send it to your boss.

301
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,500
And you're happy he's happy and your script has done.

302
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,670
Next time he comes back to you and say,

303
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,040
Hey,

304
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,600
can you give me that same list again?

305
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,500
What do you have to do?

306
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,010
You have to run the command.

307
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,650
Put in all those variables again.

308
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,690
No.

309
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,750
You have a script.

310
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,610
You made your life easy.

311
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,420
So you just run the script and there it goes.

312
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,970
Now you could go one step further.

313
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,480
How is you?

314
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,690
Could actually automate this task by running to the Cron job.

315
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,590
If your manager tells you that I need a list of everyone who logs in on Monday off every

316
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:18,900
month,

317
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,150
you could specify that as well.

318
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,380
All right,

319
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,620
Hopefully I works out for you.

320
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,380
Try it out.

321
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,650
Try to different options.
