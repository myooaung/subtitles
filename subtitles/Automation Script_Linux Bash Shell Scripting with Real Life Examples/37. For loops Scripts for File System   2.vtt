00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
OK,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.640
moving on to the next lesson.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.680
This lesson is also about four Loop and its extension off the last lesson that recover here

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.330
we are going to cover again.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.640
A couple of for scripts.

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:22.790
One scripts that we wanted to core is how we could rename files that has dot txt file

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.750
extension to dot none,

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.550
or any fire that you wanted to change with a different name.

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.030
The second script,

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.630
a little color,

11
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.050
is check to see if files exist.

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.620
Now the file exists.

13
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.970
Sometimes you have to actually log into,

14
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.370
ah,

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.250
difference over,

16
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.260
and you need to find out if,

17
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.450
in a difference over a file exist on that's over as well or not.

18
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.370
Um,

19
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.640
so you could create that script in there and you could check that both of these scripts are

20
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.390
have a very,

21
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.150
um,

22
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.780
very much application to the to the really real life,

23
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.870
because I actually worked on many of these these type of task where I have to change or

24
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.350
rename the files or I have to check if those files exist or not.

25
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.360
So I'm gonna cover these ah,

26
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.600
again real example.

27
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.450
A log into my next machine straight here.

28
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.520
Um I am blogging is myself.

29
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.580
And of course,

30
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.080
I am in my home directory and I'm gonna create a new ah script,

31
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.450
and I'm gonna name it rename files,

32
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.510
and we're gonna start with our same practice.

33
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.050
It's only gonna take a few seconds.

34
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:47.500
So please get into the habit of doing Dad date description,

35
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.550
which is for me,

36
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.750
the most important one.

37
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.650
This script will pre name Clough's ending with dot txt,

38
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.940
um,

39
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.250
and then I have to do the modified day.

40
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.920
That chair's since this is a new one.

41
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.980
I'll just put the new the same day.

42
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.550
Okay.

43
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.390
The script the first group was going to do is it's gonna put create a variable for So this

44
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.750
time I'm gonna pick a different variable I'm gonna put like a fly and lame.

45
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:31.470
You could put I again if you want to and asterix dot txt So it's gonna look for all the

46
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.850
files in the current directory.

47
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.640
Ah,

48
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.610
that has the ending name with dot Txt and Estrich is you know,

49
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.230
it's a wild card is gonna look for that and is gonna put in a container name.

50
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.950
Finally.

51
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.790
Okay,

52
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.600
it's gonna do that.

53
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.550
What else you want to do now I want to do,

54
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.250
do move whatever comes from that container.

55
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.150
So whatever comes from the container,

56
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.850
name it.

57
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:14.480
Rename it to file name percent Sign changed right here to none and done so once again,

58
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.300
it's gonna get the list of all the dot text fall and put it in a container and the

59
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.340
container name is father.

60
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.870
Then it's going to do is more that list off all the files that are in that container and

61
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.530
it's gonna rename it to.

62
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.420
And this is the This is the string or Syntex that you have to pick,

63
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.050
which is dollar um,

64
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.130
curly braces file name,

65
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.050
which is the name of our actual file.

66
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.500
And this percent sign is actually gonna It's actually like a wildcard dot Texas saying

67
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.470
Whatever that is our text,

68
00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:05.380
change it to dot none and then be done with Get proper to Cuba.

69
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.950
Permission.

70
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.740
Now let's run it.

71
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.850
And it's It's not the right one renamed for us and it say's cannot stat.

72
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.390
Astra got text.

73
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.690
No such father directory.

74
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.400
Perfect.

75
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.390
It means it works how it works.

76
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.650
Why did they give us our message?

77
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.120
Because we do not have any file in our current directory that ends with dot txt.

78
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.870
So if you do ls minus l astra dot txt See,

79
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.700
nothing is in there,

80
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.550
so we will create some falls Touch.

81
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.350
I'm Rhonda Txt.

82
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:46.130
Um f cyl dot txt or any dot txt.

83
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.880
So we created these three falls and these three files will be renamed to dot Done when I

84
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.700
run the script.

85
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.790
So let's run the script.

86
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.140
Renew Falls hit,

87
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.950
Enter it Ran and let's verify it.

88
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.330
And it did change from Doc.

89
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.570
Txt two dot Not so.

90
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.250
That's one of the example you could change,

91
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.150
uh,

92
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.750
multiple files with your script in one shot.

93
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.950
Next one we have that we want to cover is check to see if I'll exist.

94
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.330
This one,

95
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.070
I use it.

96
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.310
I have used it in the past as well,

97
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.150
many times.

98
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:32.170
So let's do copy Rename Wells and I wanted to do check files copied.

99
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.200
Saved us time.

100
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.050
So in r b I files,

101
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.150
I leave everything in there,

102
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:46.150
except this script will check four files that it's changed a description.

103
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.120
Everything stays same and removed the script and start the new scripts.

104
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.080
And now what are the files that you want to check.

105
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.460
So I want to first create a variable in the variable.

106
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:06.350
Just put files equal Put double coat slash at sea password.

107
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.150
Every system has that right slash etc.

108
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.350
Group.

109
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.000
Every system should has that too.

110
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.950
If it's not,

111
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.760
then who?

112
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.460
You have a problem.

113
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.740
Right?

114
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.350
So that's what we wanted to make sure.

115
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.250
Shadow See?

116
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:32.540
And and a switch dot com at sea S s h d underscore.

117
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.350
Ssh!

118
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.750
Underscore,

119
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.650
I think.

120
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.390
And the last one,

121
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.600
I just want to put fake its just a fake.

122
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.430
I wanted to see if the script actually finds it.

123
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.660
Hey,

124
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.750
this file doesn't exist.

125
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.990
All right,

126
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.150
so these are the files of closed the coats.

127
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.660
These these are all the files and putting in a variable called files.

128
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.950
Good.

129
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.810
Variable is defined now,

130
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.550
what you want to do.

131
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.050
But of course,

132
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.250
it will put an empty line four.

133
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:07.150
Now you're creating another area before file in files.

134
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.460
So all these files that are in this variable now,

135
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.890
I want you to put those files coming from this variable into another variable.

136
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:25.450
And everybody called is just file lowered his father do If now here's a new one.

137
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:41.400
If exclamation Mm file this is going to do is if the flowers are coming here that do not

138
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.940
exist.

139
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.950
Exploration means do not equal to the file that I have specified.

140
00:07:45.950 --> 00:08:07.750
Then echo the file do not exist that go another empty line,

141
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.050
see?

142
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.850
And Okay,

143
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.450
so basically,

144
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.250
what I'm saying is,

145
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:20.460
if you go and look for all these files right here in this container and then put all these

146
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:28.150
file in a new container and then do is test if these files actually exist in this system

147
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.550
and if they do not exist,

148
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.080
then tell me they do not exist.

149
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.850
If they exist,

150
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.420
don't worry about it.

151
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.050
Don't tell me So that's why I didn't use else command.

152
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.650
Let's run it.

153
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.750
And now check falls.

154
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.110
Okay.

155
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.460
You see?

156
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.470
Right here It's his at sea s message de un discourses,

157
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.070
sage convict do not exist at sea.

158
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.150
Fake do not exist.

159
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.950
Okay.

160
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.730
Yes.

161
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.410
So SS issue underscore cessation.

162
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.630
Convict that file.

163
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.770
I actually there is a fall there,

164
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.180
but I actually by mistake the wrong one.

165
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.560
Actually,

166
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.850
it is at sea as his age.

167
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.310
Really?

168
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.180
I am not ruled.

169
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.250
That's why it's not going.

170
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:23.140
ASUs each Ssh config.

171
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.040
Yes,

172
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.230
this is the actual fought so.

173
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.880
But I haven't specified wrong here.

174
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.850
That's why it says do not exist.

175
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.690
That's how the script is doing.

176
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.250
So what's why would we need that script?

177
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.950
Because,

178
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.050
as I said before,

179
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.390
Ah,

180
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:41.880
what was that?

181
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.240
Sorry.

182
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.520
That said before,

183
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.700
many times you do have to go into a different system to check if those files exists and

184
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.060
make sure even if it's the application file or database fall,

185
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.940
you need to verify those file exists.

186
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.210
And that's why you're not having the problem,

187
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.450
because file do not exist.

188
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.750
That's how you run the script.

189
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.450
You could specify different files to test on it and see how it works.
