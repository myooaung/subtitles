00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Hello,

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.640
everyone.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.740
Since we are on a network configuration,

4
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.150
part of the Lennox will talk about Nick bonding,

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.310
where exactly the nick bonding is just to let you know,

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.510
Nick Bonding is one of the very important and critical aspect in the next number

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.310
configuration,

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.750
and this type of questions are asked often time in an interview.

9
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.490
So let's see a Nick and Nick stands for network interface card that is attaches to your

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.250
computer.

11
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.380
So if you look at your laptop or behind,

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.600
your PC will see a little port in there and that poor is your neck with Nick,

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.350
which network interface card bonding is also known as network bonding,

14
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.000
it can be defined as the aggregation or combination off multiple nick into a single bond

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.880
interface.

16
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.440
Its main purpose is to provide high availability and redundancy.

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.470
So let's look at our picture.

18
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.950
We have this four neck cards on a computer,

19
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.190
so what we do in Nick bonding is we take two ports.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.280
We combine them together,

21
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
and the reason we combined them because of what If one port dies,

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.310
we still have another port.

23
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.000
So this is for the redundancy.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.610
So another way to make two ports redundant or to have them.

25
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.320
High availability is you combine them together.

26
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.560
If a port is one gig and the other port is one,

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.870
get you.

28
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.500
Combine them together to aggregate them and get the true put off.

29
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.860
Two.

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.170
Gig.

31
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.310
This is achieved for high availability and link aggregation.

32
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.990
So Nick bonding procedure is that you type mod prob owning,

33
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.220
which is to get the configuration off your driver info bonding to get the information of

34
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.930
your bonding.

35
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.030
Then you create a file called If Convict Bond zero.

36
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.580
You added the first Internet one.

37
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.870
You added the second,

38
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.530
Ethan that,

39
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.600
and you combine them and point to bond.

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.050
Zero.

41
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.720
If you have Nick one file,

42
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.950
you create another Nick to file for the second neck,

43
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.060
and then you create 1/3 file called Bond zero.

44
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.560
You point your Nick one and Nick to files to word bond zero.

45
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.540
And then what do you do at the end?

46
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.300
You restart the network off your computer,

47
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.260
since the command is system CTL Restart network.

48
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.570
So without further do I log into my system and I'll tell you exactly how Nick bonding can

49
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.150
be done.

50
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.080
And before we start this fortune box I want you to take its snapshot.

51
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.480
The reason I'm taking a snapshot is so good.

52
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.330
Rigor of work back to a state which is where it is right now after we do all the

53
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.050
configuration.

54
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.800
So click on right here,

55
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.660
you see snap shot,

56
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.830
click on Snapshot And right here says take click on the take.

57
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.010
Leave the snapshot number one as name default and click.

58
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.390
OK,

59
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.890
now it has taken the snapshot.

60
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:23.380
Now I want you to click on setting Go to network click on network adapter to check enabled

61
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
network adapter and select Bridged Adapt.

62
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.080
Now we will have to Nick's on a computer,

63
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.210
which is one here adapter one and adapt to to If you want more adapters,

64
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.310
we could go to it after three and four and check on a naval network adapter.

65
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.810
But we will work only Dr One and Adopter to at this time.

66
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.040
And I want you cook.

67
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.650
Okay,

68
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.060
So once the setting is done,

69
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.890
go ahead and click on start.

70
00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.890
Go ahead and log in as yourself.

71
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.700
Okay.

72
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.950
When you have the desktop right,

73
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.570
click on your desktop and open up your terminal.

74
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.950
I'd like to make the consul the terminal a little bigger.

75
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:27.250
Go ahead and type if config and doom or under output.

76
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.650
And here you will see.

77
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.370
Now you have to network interfaces.

78
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.080
One is an E and P zero as three.

79
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.000
And the 2nd 1 is GNP's oh estate.

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.360
The NP zero s eight is the one that we just added to article worship box.

81
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.150
No,

82
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.700
What we want to do is we want to combine these 23 and ate together and make a bond out of

83
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.050
these two interfaces.

84
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.050
Become rules first.

85
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.930
Okay,

86
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.440
let's clear the screen now.

87
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.940
I will open up a document that I have that has all the commands and configuration in my

88
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.550
document.

89
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.680
This document is also added as port off your handouts.

90
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.730
So before you do this exercise,

91
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.840
I want you to also open up this document from your handouts.

92
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.400
Have it side by side while you do the configuration of bonding.

93
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.850
So I have already opened this document.

94
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.810
Okay,

95
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.980
so now it says,

96
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.370
Just follow the directions.

97
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.070
This is add.

98
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.310
And you,

99
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.720
Nick,

100
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.080
if it does not exist installed bonding driver mod problem bonding.

101
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.090
You need to install this if you don't have bonding enabled.

102
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.910
But let's say if you do have it or not,

103
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.660
so do mod info bonding,

104
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.650
and I want you to do more on it.

105
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.130
And once you doom or and if you get their output and description,

106
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.780
says Ethan,

107
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.200
a child bonding driver,

108
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.020
words in 3.7 up one.

109
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.280
That means you already have the driver installed,

110
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.740
which is the Mod Probe and Lennox.

111
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.850
So you don't have to worry about installing it so you can move on to the next step.

112
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.660
Okay,

113
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:28.740
The next step is to create a new file called I See If G dash on zero right here and I have

114
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.180
to create this file in this directory in this path.

115
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.160
So if I copy and paste is not gonna work,

116
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.150
so I have to type it.

117
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.370
So I go back into a machine and I do the eye at sea.

118
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.590
Sis config Network scripts.

119
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:59.530
See if g dash bond Jew Now you are envy.

120
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.750
I mode hit I to insert,

121
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.070
and I want you to start typing exactly what's it's written in there.

122
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.720
Please make sure don't make a mistake.

123
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.750
Type is bond.

124
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.320
Name off.

125
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:25.840
This bond is a bond zero bonding master meaning?

126
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.010
Who is the Master off.

127
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.230
This bonding is it's a self so yes,

128
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.670
it's a boot proedl.

129
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:44.390
So when you type none or static,

130
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.500
it means the same thing.

131
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.450
So type none on boot.

132
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.800
Yes,

133
00:07:51.800 --> 00:08:00.710
I p address.

134
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.210
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.350
There's a mistake.

136
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:20.190
It should be just i p a d D r The I p that I have picked is 1 92 the 1 68 0.1 dot 80.

137
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:26.410
Because I have already typed this I p before and I know this I p does not exist.

138
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.610
Nobody has taken it.

139
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.010
But if you want to confirm if this I p is not taken,

140
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:39.360
you could just go into you could open up another terminal and duping 19 to 1 68 a $1.80 and

141
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.280
you will see you.

142
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:47.580
And you're not getting a response back on that I p That means it's not taken.

143
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.190
So use i p I'm assigning the static.

144
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.950
I p no mask.

145
00:08:52.950 --> 00:09:00.450
2552552550 Gateway.

146
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:12.050
He is the I P address off your modem and then bonding under school options.

147
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.290
Equal mode five.

148
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.750
I'm picking mode five.

149
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.800
And what exactly?

150
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.740
Malan five is army.

151
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.470
I'm on is this is the speed and the state.

152
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:33.540
I have also included that in my document exactly what these options mean And I want you to

153
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.710
review them and you will know exactly what it means.

154
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.750
So now you could just save and exit the file.

155
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.580
Okay?

156
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.210
Once you have that says the bonding options detail can be found here.

157
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.650
You see?

158
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.230
Right here has all the option repacked.

159
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.810
If you remember,

160
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.300
we picked option five,

161
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.510
which is transmit load balancing.

162
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:02.730
You could read about it and then am I i m o n which is a monitoring am I linked monitoring

163
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.140
frequency in Mili seconds.

164
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.980
We picked 100.

165
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.910
Okay,

166
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:12.010
So next step is this is added the first Knick file,

167
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.250
which is e and P zero as three.

168
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.470
So I am in the root directory.

169
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.700
I'll go into that sea says config.

170
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.660
Just drag this a little more so you could see a little better.

171
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.590
Says conf exceeding network script.

172
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.260
And in this directory,

173
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.980
I already have a file called at CCF,

174
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.550
g E and P zero history do the I.

175
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.670
And now I have here.

176
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:44.200
I said delete the entire contents of how do you delete it in the Via You do de de de de de

177
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.020
de de de keep doing dee dee dee dee dee until you go to the bottom.

178
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.970
You are the bottom and says no lines in buffered.

179
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.440
That's good.

180
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.150
Now hit.

181
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.580
Enter.

182
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.350
Sorry.

183
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.660
On a hit insert you have.

184
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.150
You probably have to hit insert a couple of times to get it.

185
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.640
It's now keep typing.

186
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:00.770
What,

187
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.240
exactly?

188
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.850
It's in their type.

189
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.960
The next pro.

190
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:21.250
None device E and P zero s three on Booth.

191
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.490
Yes.

192
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.160
You want to have that boots hardware address?

193
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.080
This is a new one.

194
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.730
Now,

195
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.410
this is the Mac address off your eat and peas.

196
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.810
Your best three.

197
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.290
So,

198
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.500
what is my hardware Mac address?

199
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.540
Um,

200
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.360
you have to open up another term in the back drug,

201
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.150
and then just type if config and do more,

202
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:52.350
and you will see e and P zero s three has a Mac address off this.

203
00:11:52.350 --> 00:12:00.050
So what I will do is I'll drag this a little bit on top.

204
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.890
I'll bring the other window in the bar in the back,

205
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.380
and now I could type the address.

206
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:17.150
08 Joe 27 c three zero.

207
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.960
Sorry.

208
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.840
Zero A to there.

209
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:31.700
28 verified to seven C 30 28 years and then it entered.

210
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.350
Master,

211
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.740
it's asking you who's your master?

212
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.340
The master is bond zero,

213
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.120
which is the other file that we created before that hit.

214
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.720
Enter Slave,

215
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.740
Are you a slave?

216
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.080
Meaning this interface is in a slave.

217
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.640
Listen.

218
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.100
Yes,

219
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.200
Toe check again.

220
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.770
Boot Proto boot.

221
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.370
We missed one.

222
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.850
Oh,

223
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:54.010
no,

224
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.420
we did not.

225
00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:00.020
It's their type blue proto device on boot hardware address,

226
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.720
which is America.

227
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.770
Just master his bond,

228
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.770
your and slaves This.

229
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:03.990
Okay,

230
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.150
now save and exit.

231
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.150
Okay,

232
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.170
Now follow the directions.

233
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.220
Okay.

234
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.620
Now it says create the second nick file for E N P zero s eight.

235
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.940
I could create a 2nd 1 Or I could just copy this e and P zero as three and changed the name

236
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.590
and Mac address so it will be easier.

237
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:30.160
Could just copy e and P's or s three and I name it.

238
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:42.380
See if g dash bnp's Orosz three and take up in a place 38 nights copied now,

239
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:42.670
V.

240
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:48.980
I see if g e and P's you're s eight now in your S eight.

241
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:55.290
Now you have to change this third line says device zero s three with eight.

242
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.100
Yes,

243
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.440
Yes.

244
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.550
And now the Mac address would be different.

245
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.120
Well,

246
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.660
back to you.

247
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.340
Other command,

248
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.250
that is open.

249
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:09.920
Bag it up and you will see here The marketers for GNP zero s eight is this one.

250
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.790
So once you have it highlighted,

251
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.250
drag it down so you could see it.

252
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.250
And now it change it.

253
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.400
It has.

254
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.830
It has changed after the three.

255
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.340
Opted,

256
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.760
though.

257
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.710
Zero d 17 nine b.

258
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.160
Okay,

259
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.660
Bond zero Master is the bond zero slave.

260
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:29.970
Yes,

261
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.790
I am a slave for Bonzo then,

262
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.920
right?

263
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.860
Quit Conceived of all follow saved.

264
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.550
Now I want to restart service system.

265
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.950
See Thiel,

266
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.970
restore the network SOS number three star hit.

267
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.450
Enter by running.

268
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:58.990
If config do the more on it and you will see now the I p that I have assigned says right

269
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.420
here 19 to 1 68 $1.80.

270
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.220
Its master and the other ports.

271
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.520
Sorry.

272
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.360
Other nicks.

273
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.360
U N P zero as three.

274
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.050
And it's eight.

275
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.950
You see here right here says you're their slave and slave.

276
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.970
So I ps signed has given 19 to 1 $61.80.

277
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:22.050
I'm gonna take this I p plug it into my party session and see if I could connect to it.

278
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.860
1 90 to 1 68 Rwanda 80 it enter.

279
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.470
Yes,

280
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.050
I could connect.

281
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.770
This is just a sausage key warning sign.

282
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.650
You could just accept it to save it.

283
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:40.790
And Dogan And yes,

284
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.180
There you go.

285
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:50.350
So now you know that your interface is combined together to and pointing it to Bonzo.

286
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.350
Any other instructions that we have,

287
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.550
we could go down.

288
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.020
We could also see here.

289
00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:08.390
It's telling me that I could verify the setting by doing cat at Sea Pro Nick Bonding and

290
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.230
Bond zero.

291
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.550
And I do that I should not have.

292
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.310
Okay,

293
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.350
let me make this bigger.

294
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.950
And now you'll see her when I did the cat,

295
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.550
you see it say's currently active slave is this one?

296
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.750
It is Lord balancing slave interfaces.

297
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.140
This and seconds later interfaces this now once it is done,

298
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.350
I want you reward back to your original bm so just close it.

299
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.800
Power it off close and says power off the machine.

300
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:48.690
You pour it off Now go to your oracle Were from machine right here and first once wait for

301
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.450
it to power off,

302
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:56.570
then go to setting and then come to network come good network adapter to unchecked the one

303
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.450
we checked before.

304
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:58.970
Click.

305
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.760
Ok now it should not have the second adopter,

306
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:09.180
but I want to click now to the Snapshot one and click on Restore that this is going to

307
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:15.370
restore to the original state where we had it before Here it will create another snapshot

308
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:21.160
off your current state which I don't want you to do so unchecked this box and click restore

309
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.160
.

310
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:28.050
Now it is restored to exactly same way where it was before we started this lesson.

311
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.450
Alright guys,

312
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.700
I hope you enjoyed it and please try it on.

313
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.590
This is this is one of the topic is that's very important.

314
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.300
You will be working on a physical machines most of the time and you have to do number

315
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.850
bonding
