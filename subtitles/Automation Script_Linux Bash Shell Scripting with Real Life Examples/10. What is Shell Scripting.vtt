00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
So now let's talk about what is a shell script.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.650
So put all your instruction in a show or in a container and just running.

3
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.490
So if I have to explain it through a diagram,

4
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.450
let's put it this way.

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.060
This is a shell,

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.410
right?

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.150
Like actually a shell.

8
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.410
So you actually putting all those things All those instructions like do this,

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.430
do that,

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.470
or else do that it sector everything.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.300
You putting that together in a shell and then telling Shell,

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.900
run this set of instructions and,

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.270
of course,

14
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.560
run them in a sequence by default,

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.010
the shell runs old instruction in sequence.

16
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.770
Now,

17
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.850
if you notice you goto windows and you want to copy a file from one folder to another,

18
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.190
you right click to it or control,

19
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.350
see to it and then you go to another window and then you paste it.

20
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.540
Now how does it work?

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.750
How does Windows knows that I have been given instructions to copy it and paste it,

22
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
because when you right click and give you the option to copy and then you go to under the

23
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
window gives you the instruction to paste that is the function off a shell.

24
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.450
The shell is copy instructions to copy a shell is instruction to paste.

25
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.760
So just like that,

26
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.210
any out the commands or any off those functions that you run and windows,

27
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.000
they are all created within a shell within a commands.

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.750
You don't see those commands.

29
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.230
And in fact,

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.020
if you wanted to really run and Windows,

31
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.230
you,

32
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.500
you could just go toe open up the DOS prompt and you could actually run those commands a

33
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.570
copy command to copy file from another.

34
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.260
But of course,

35
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.600
Windows.

36
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.270
Microsoft had made your life a lot easier to run all those commands through graphical

37
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.780
interface,

38
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.370
which is Click click,

39
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.850
click now in Lenox.

40
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910
You don't have that luxury,

41
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.140
and that's why I also Lennox is difference it because it's not gui based,

42
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.900
kind of,

43
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.430
um,

44
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.490
operating system.

45
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.580
It's a command line,

46
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.170
so you could run your function a lot faster so you don't have to deal with gooey and go

47
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.770
using up your CPU and memory.

48
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.460
So what do you do?

49
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.950
You run,

50
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.530
copy command or you run,

51
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.950
Move command or all those commands that you run.

52
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.850
Those are what are those?

53
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.500
Those are actual the scripts.

54
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.150
Those are shell script and who have written those the developers,

55
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.460
those people who have done development,

56
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.070
those people will do C plus plus or C development.

57
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.450
They create those scripts so you could use those scripts leverage on those scripts in

58
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.950
Creature own Shell script.

59
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.050
So that's how the shell scripting works.
