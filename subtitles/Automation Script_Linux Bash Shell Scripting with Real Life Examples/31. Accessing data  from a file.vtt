00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
accessing data from a file.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.870
Ah,

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.670
file is consists of some kind of data right there.

4
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.450
It has,

5
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.370
ah lot of information inside,

6
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.050
and you need to pull that information every now and then.

7
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.560
Now,

8
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.490
that file could be any file that could be application file,

9
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.550
database files,

10
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.670
a simple text file,

11
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.850
a log file,

12
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.540
any kind of while that you try to retrieve some data,

13
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.210
massage the data and you want to view it the way you want to.

14
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.530
Now,

15
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.270
you could do that manually by running commands,

16
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.150
adding commands here and there every day.

17
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.100
But of course,

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.450
if you are doing that,

19
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.400
changing off data are running those commands every day.

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.650
Then this task doing a manual become tedious.

21
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.750
So the best thing to do is to automate that and the way you automated.

22
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
You actually create a shell script to do that.

23
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.310
So in this lesson,

24
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.410
we are going to create the first grip level poll errors,

25
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.730
failures or warnings,

26
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.770
or any kind of information that you want to pull from a file.

27
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.840
So most likely we will be using,

28
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.910
like our log messaging file,

29
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.810
which has,

30
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.980
which is a huge fall which gets,

31
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.720
which actually logs all the error messages or warnings of failures or many other ah system

32
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.350
related messages in a file.

33
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.950
But sometimes when you want to view that while you don't want to go through all that stuff

34
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.950
,

35
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.250
that information stuff or something that is not related or it's not,

36
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.930
um,

37
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.280
actually what you're looking for So this is the first script it'll go into and create a

38
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.600
script.

39
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.850
The second script that I wanted to cover is then you actually have some of the

40
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.250
administrative commands that you run and then you want to change.

41
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.080
Um,

42
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.190
the output of the file and perhaps output toe a different ball said this way,

43
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.180
Every time you come in,

44
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.000
it's viewable by,

45
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800
um,

46
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.350
and you whenever you run the command.

47
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.500
So let's look at our first.

48
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.250
I'm gonna log into my Lennox machine party client.

49
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.150
I'm logged in as myself,

50
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
and I am in my home directory.

51
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.100
Now I want you to copy Ah,

52
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.710
war log messages from war log to your current directory.

53
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.990
Now,

54
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.450
what is your current directory?

55
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.400
You contract is home.

56
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.070
I have salt.

57
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.050
I want you to go ahead and create a new directory and call it,

58
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.850
um,

59
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:42.210
Sessional scripts This is the name you have chosen.

60
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.170
Maybe you add all our new newly created scripts into this directory.

61
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.090
And when I do ls minus l to you are You will see the bottom.

62
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.230
It has that directory now.

63
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.550
I wanted to copy noir log messages,

64
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.030
file into my current directory,

65
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.250
and there would be dot and you hit enter.

66
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.830
Okay,

67
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.580
You say it's coming up as permission Denied.

68
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.880
Why?

69
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.450
Because war log messages file is owned by room and it is not.

70
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.560
It does not have read permission for anyone else.

71
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.750
So what we will do is will become route.

72
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:42.250
And now I will copy war log messages.

73
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:57.050
So I'm doing CD war log messages to my home directory.

74
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.850
And from there I will copy it to professional scripts.

75
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.750
Now it is copied.

76
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.200
Now let's go to my home.

77
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.450
I have salt professional scripts directory and let's see,

78
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.810
the file is there.

79
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.150
Okay,

80
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.830
good.

81
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.380
So now,

82
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.450
in order for me to read that file,

83
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.750
it should have the right read permissions right here.

84
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.930
So what I'll do is I will go ahead.

85
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.870
And first of all,

86
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.650
I'll change the ownership filed.

87
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.650
C h mod.

88
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:43.990
I have solved messages own bill.

89
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.420
Okay,

90
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.560
I think it's changed.

91
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.950
Ma messages file toe.

92
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.550
All right.

93
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.020
Oh,

94
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.170
no.

95
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.530
Sorry.

96
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.550
I'm using change mine.

97
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.250
It has to be changed ownership because we're changing the ownership.

98
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.850
Okay,

99
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.250
it has changed.

100
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.350
Now you'll see when we make this a little.

101
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.840
Now you will see this file messages fall is owned by I have salt.

102
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.050
Now I'm going to change the group as well as a change group.

103
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.250
I,

104
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.910
um,

105
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.750
have saw two messages,

106
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.460
and now you will see I should be able to read this file so I could have assigned the read

107
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.150
permissions right here of a change model.

108
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.120
Or I just have given the ownership a change.

109
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.850
The ownership too.

110
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.870
I have.

111
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.850
So So now I could exit out of room.

112
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.600
Rich,

113
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.320
dark human.

114
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.770
I am in slash home.

115
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.350
I have soul.

116
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.850
I'm gonna go into my professional scripts directory ls minus lt r.

117
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.650
And there it has the messages.

118
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.620
Now,

119
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.490
to make sure I could read it,

120
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.490
I could just simply cat the messages follow just to make sure I created Yes,

121
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.750
I could read Clear the screen.

122
00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.950
Now I'm gonna create first scrip called Cool date.

123
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.450
If you are using different scripting as Well,

124
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.850
I'll put dot Basha here.

125
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.510
Well,

126
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.850
just literally pulled the and her.

127
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.940
Now what do you do?

128
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.550
First thing you give correct shells.

129
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.000
Sorry.

130
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.520
The shell,

131
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.250
which has been bashed next,

132
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.550
you know.

133
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.550
Hello there,

134
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:42.550
Date general.

135
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:52.650
A slash 08 slash 2020 description.

136
00:06:52.650 --> 00:07:07.550
This scrip will whom Onley error messages from war log messages.

137
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.950
You could directly pull those messages,

138
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:12.940
but you have to be rude,

139
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.600
but since,

140
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.960
um,

141
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.750
be in a room,

142
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.680
Um,

143
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.240
it's just example that I'm giving the copy.

144
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.880
The messages fall in a local and home and modified if it is modified.

145
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.250
Since we're greeting for the first time Totally the same date.

146
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.050
Okay,

147
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.350
So our basic things are done.

148
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.650
Shell is defined,

149
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.850
the comments are defined.

150
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.570
Now,

151
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.350
what are exactly be doing?

152
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:46.710
We wanted to pull Onley error messages from the messages follow.

153
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.110
You don't want to view anything.

154
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.250
So to do that,

155
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.350
we'll have to do cause we are groping for error messages.

156
00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:04.810
Minus I is to ignore or case case ever from where I would always specify absolute path.

157
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.450
You don't want to specify the relative pat because if you're running from another directory

158
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.450
,

159
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.250
this same scribble failed.

160
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:17.850
I have so professional scripts.

161
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.470
So for now,

162
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.950
just run that and just make sure works control.

163
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.850
Um,

164
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.750
quit right quick.

165
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.740
And it Now,

166
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.650
the next thing you have to do is give executed permission to pull data.

167
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:41.600
This mind sell TR and you'll see our first script is created.

168
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:52.010
So when I run that pull data it say's grip home I have salt is a directory,

169
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.520
huh?

170
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.630
Because we did not specify the file.

171
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.350
You need to go in one step inside.

172
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.950
So pull data.

173
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.380
And we actually trying to grab for errors from directory.

174
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.030
So of course,

175
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.150
there is no such thing is Dark doesn't have the data.

176
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.500
He only has filed,

177
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.750
so we'll put messages.

178
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.350
Okay.

179
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.090
Now,

180
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.350
when we run this script,

181
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:28.740
it is giving us on Lee the error messages all the far all the lines inside of that bar log

182
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.150
messaging file.

183
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.450
I'm Onley getting the error messages now.

184
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.450
Probably thinking Why do we need just a room messages?

185
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.600
Well,

186
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.250
if you are in corporate environment,

187
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.230
trust me.

188
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:47.110
You gonna be troubleshooting system related application related so many times that you

189
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:52.350
would have to go into the log files and look for her messages that where it failed,

190
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.300
so you could go through 19 by line by line,

191
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.910
which is gonna take you forever.

192
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.260
Or you could just simply fill their out for our messages.

193
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.450
And then you will get right to the point that why and how it is failing.

194
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.050
Now,

195
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.700
there are some field messages right here.

196
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.040
Of course,

197
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.050
we're not troubleshooting these field messages,

198
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.830
but it is just an example that I'm giving now.

199
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.350
Every time you come in,

200
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.050
you log into your system,

201
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.430
your manager or your ah,

202
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.450
someone from the development team or someone who say,

203
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:21.740
Hey,

204
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.960
I'm getting our message from this system or system is running slower.

205
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.650
This applications failing or something.

206
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:34.620
So you just all you have to do is run the script and see what are those Air messages?

207
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.250
Four.

208
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.750
So what I will do at this point,

209
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.520
I will instead of do pull data,

210
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.650
I will rename this file to move pull data to pull errors.

211
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.550
So this way it is Pacific to,

212
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.350
um the data are the words that you're tryingto so let's run again.

213
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.960
Full errors.

214
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.840
And now we have errors.

215
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840
Similarly,

216
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.140
if he wanted to,

217
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:03.750
um,

218
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.550
pull all the warning messages,

219
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.800
we could do the same thing.

220
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.950
But instead of creative recreating a new script,

221
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.570
what I'll do is I'll copy pull data off.

222
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:17.790
Sorry,

223
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.750
pulled errors and I'll name it Cool warning.

224
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.200
So now I have two scripts.

225
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.850
One is pull errors and the other one is pulled warnings.

226
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.020
But now both heart.

227
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.330
Same.

228
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:40.550
So I have to go into the pull warn Sign quit and I'll have to instead of error put in

229
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.850
Warren.

230
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:55.970
No save now Let's run pulled Warne now and you will see you have a lot of warning signs in

231
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.710
the system.

232
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.050
What's going on?

233
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.170
Um see,

234
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:05.260
right here is warning application genome settings killed by signal five or any of the

235
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.850
things that happened with the application of your system,

236
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.440
it will be logged here now.

237
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.040
The last one I will do is this.

238
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.850
Copy it again.

239
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.150
Pull!

240
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.850
Ah,

241
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.220
warn I will do.

242
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.850
Pull.

243
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.450
All right,

244
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.450
now feel.

245
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.480
Look,

246
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.730
I'll go into field trip again instead of warn.

247
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:37.850
I'll just do failed now I had three scripts to verify.

248
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.080
It did.

249
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.510
The last one is pulled fail.

250
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.410
So let's run,

251
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:41.710
pull,

252
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.150
fail!

253
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:48.770
And now it's on Lee giving me failed related lines,

254
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.380
anything that has failed in the line.

255
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.260
I will only get dad now.

256
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.650
You could also leave it as is right now if you want to.

257
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:03.650
But most the time of people do is they put this to another file.

258
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:09.620
So this way they could easily minute police text inside of them file instead of just going

259
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.350
into the war log messages.

260
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.840
So how that is done,

261
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.810
you could just let's go back to our first group,

262
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.550
which is pull.

263
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:21.190
And here I will go group minus.

264
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.060
I are,

265
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:34.650
and I will output to my home directory and directory.

266
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:46.250
And now I will name the output off the script as output ever.

267
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.610
If you notice I have to.

268
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.450
Slash is here.

269
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.350
So I'm gonna get rid of one.

270
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.780
So now let's run it now.

271
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.050
This time and you run it,

272
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.590
it is not going to show you all those error messages on the screen.

273
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.710
Instead,

274
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:09.080
it is going to push out all the messages that came with the word error it's gonna go into

275
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.240
ah,

276
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.370
file that be just specified.

277
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:17.600
So let's run pool era and you see,

278
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.420
you got your prom back so it doesn't mean it didn't run.

279
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:20.980
It did,

280
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.650
Ron,

281
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:26.060
But has created a fire that you wanted to create.

282
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.750
They go see output error.

283
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:35.480
So now you could have simply cat out this up put air file and read through it the same way

284
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.830
you could do it where the fail the same way you could do with warning if you want to.

285
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.550
Now,

286
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.170
also,

287
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.620
what happened is which I will also cover later on that many system administrators.

288
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.950
What they do is they schedule this type off scripts in Cron job.

289
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.650
They tell the Cron job,

290
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.550
run this group at certain times of the day,

291
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:02.450
and when you come in you all you have to do is view that file that's one step further.

292
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.070
Now,

293
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.550
if you want to take it another step further,

294
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.890
what it will do is it will not only run the script.

295
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:13.450
It would also send the output off the script,

296
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:19.850
which is the help put Dash air file through your email through the Sendmail Protocol,

297
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.850
which is one of the best ways you could do that.

298
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.600
When you come into your office in the morning and the first thing you do,

299
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.100
you open up your email and you say,

300
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.620
Hey,

301
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.650
I got these emails and alerts that saying I had this type.

302
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.800
Our message is so this is about,

303
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.550
um,

304
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.050
creating a pulling data from files.

305
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:47.180
You could also modify it in terms off if you want to just see the number of warnings could

306
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.400
just do pull warning.

307
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.820
Do you see when you run it,

308
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:59.910
you get all those messages Now you could use your own script and combine it Web operating

309
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:05.450
system commands to view or to change the output.

310
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.650
The script.

311
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:14.610
If you want to see how many warning messages or lines we have and me grip for warning,

312
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.150
you could just do pipe W C minus l.

313
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.650
And you'll see there are total off 46 warning messages.

314
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.270
This shows that since we have the system,

315
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:24.820
we have,

316
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.330
ah,

317
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:31.470
46 warning messages that came in you could be more Pacific.

318
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:43.510
So if you want to just do correct and coat and you just wanted to do August 27 then ever

319
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:50.150
Onley pull August 27 warning messages and how many we have for August 27.

320
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:55.720
You have 46 so basically all those messages that have came in today anyway,

321
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.640
So this is how you pull data This is how you modify the second script I wanted to go over

322
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.550
is script that before Matt output of the administrative commands that stood administrative

323
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.220
commands.

324
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.660
Um,

325
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.300
plus,

326
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.730
I'm gonna create a new script,

327
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:19.950
call admin commands and hit Enter,

328
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:27.760
and I will go through again because this is something that you really need to know.

329
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:50.990
There description of the script format,

330
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.450
the output off admin commands.

331
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.050
And the last one has modified.

332
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:05.080
Please don't get annoyed by this because I'm keep typing that the reason I do that is

333
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.550
because I really want you to get in the habit off doing that.

334
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.850
This shows that you are an organized,

335
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.760
um,

336
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:20.330
engineer administrator who actually organized his or her scripts and put all the scripts in

337
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.050
the right way.

338
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:26.450
So 20.

339
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.580
Okay,

340
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.170
now what other commands that we want to do?

341
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:30.650
Um,

342
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.950
let's do some administrator commands like date time,

343
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.270
um,

344
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.490
and DF minus h.

345
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.120
So let's say if I want to do that and let's say you run it before we run it,

346
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.160
we have to give execute herbal permissions and now gonna be run it.

347
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.210
You'll see.

348
00:18:49.210 --> 00:19:00.660
I have date right here up time and the d F minus cape.

349
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.850
Now when I mean to format the output,

350
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:10.460
you could do that by either You run the script and formatted in a way like,

351
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:10.730
let's say,

352
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:16.760
if you only wanted to view the first Harlem off your scrip,

353
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.100
then you will only see like Monday.

354
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.720
Ah,

355
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:30.450
the date of time on file systems are that's if you want to change the format,

356
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.850
Um,

357
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:38.350
after you run this or you could go into the script,

358
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.870
the script,

359
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:51.480
a Zvi I admin commands and you could go into date and you could do talk print dollar one up

360
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.660
time you could do look,

361
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.450
print dollar,

362
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.550
let's say three.

363
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:09.160
And for the DF minus H little just gripped for room.

364
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.900
So this is how we change the output off the commands.

365
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.090
Now,

366
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:16.760
when we run it,

367
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.040
you'll see the first column it gave us Monday.

368
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.550
The second column is a date,

369
00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.490
and that there is defiance.

370
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:30.320
H I just wanted to know on Lee the route station how much this space I have,

371
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.530
how much I have left.

372
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.850
I don't care for other,

373
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.880
uh,

374
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.760
file system.

375
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.660
So this is how you make changes to it?

376
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.420
Um,

377
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.980
same way there are so many commands that we learned earlier.

378
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.950
If you want to change the admin commands on you wanted to format it,

379
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.550
you could try with different commands.

380
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.350
And this is how basically we could access the data from files.
