00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
welcome to the new section off shell scripting basics.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,120
That's where we actually will learn.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,150
What really a shell scripting is what are its basics?

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,880
You know,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,030
starting from ABC or 123 So that's where we're going to start.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,480
So let's see,

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,650
what exactly are we going to co were in this entire section?

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,490
So we will start with Colonel.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:25,750
What,

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,320
exactly?

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,130
Colonel is.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,450
And how does it interacts with the shell?

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,170
And is there a colonel in operating system?

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,810
And how does it interact with your hardware?

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,050
And how does it interact?

16
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,620
Was your shell and your operating system?

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,210
What exactly Shell there's.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,700
Of course,

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,750
this is the main thing.

20
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,350
We wanted to know how the shell scripting works.

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,740
There are so many types of shells,

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,270
there are corn shell there,

23
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,080
bash.

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,850
There are,

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,760
um,

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,650
seashell and so many that I will cover in this lesson.

27
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,850
Then we will have starting to show how you gonna start a shell if you are in logged into

28
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,390
into your links machine and by default,

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,120
you have a bash shell and you want to say sure,

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,790
definite show.

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,550
How do you do that,

32
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,790
then,

33
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,290
Wilko?

34
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,550
Or how you gonna run a shell script.

35
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,580
So you have created a script.

36
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,650
Now how do you run it?

37
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,710
So this is a few things Very basic ones that you should really know.

38
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,160
And this is like a fundamental things that you should understand and put it somewhere you

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,520
know,

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,990
deep in your head that outside of the thes are like a actual guidelines that you have to

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,970
follow in order to run.

42
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,310
Ah,

43
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,330
perfect shell script.

44
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,590
So you would know when if there is an error message or if there's a problem when you're

45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,440
running a shell script,

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,050
why did it happen?

47
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,350
This section will explain you if you really go through it.
