1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
Okay,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,050
Now we know a lot.

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,740
About what other different type of shells.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,180
How do we start a shell?

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,250
How do we get into different shells?

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,280
Well,

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,550
it's simple at is simply type shelling.

8
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,560
Meaning,

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,130
if you are inborn shell and you want to get into,

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,030
um,

11
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,650
just shell or seashell Just type S h or just type C show.

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,510
So,

13
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,970
um,

14
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,680
without explaining you,

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,850
Maurin detail Ah,

16
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,000
log in straight to ah,

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,350
my Lennox machine and I'll show you how you could switch from one shell to another.

18
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,750
Okay,

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,530
so I have this limits machine and you notice that I have the school he running in.

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,500
Medics inside the gui I have this terminal so all the commands that I run from the terminal

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,150
is actually a shell.

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,780
And that shell is how do you find a show?

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,740
You do echo dollar zero and it tells you my shell is bash.

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,540
Now,

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:11,450
if I don't want to use this command line and you see in the back I have this directory

26
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,060
called home and I have this trashcan.

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,810
So if I wanted to view the contents off home,

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,550
what I do a double click.

29
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,540
So this environment right here is.

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,020
You see this environment is G.

31
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,750
Norman Mark,

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,290
remember,

33
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,110
I told you genome is also a type of shell.

34
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,010
So this is another shell right here,

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,890
and this is command line Inside is into the show.

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,680
So if I wanted to open this folder,

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,850
I am telling genome,

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,450
which is the desktop gooey to open up their folders a double click,

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,830
and it will open up the contents off that directory.

40
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,900
And these are all the directories I have these.

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,400
This is a file I have off off all the directory.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,850
If I want to go into another director and in the file,

43
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,550
or if I wanted to open up this file,

44
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,440
I'll double click and D Genome Shell is interacting with Colonel an operating system and

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,650
telling it to open it up.

46
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,510
Now,

47
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,180
what if I do not have the school environment?

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,670
Right,

49
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,760
So and not everyone is a windows.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,420
Um,

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,190
not everyone.

52
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,570
Um,

53
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,620
I wanted to get into windows.

54
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,890
They want to get in the command line.

55
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,560
So what did they do with a?

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,100
So if if you want to ah,

57
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,310
view the content off my home directory,

58
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,850
I'm sure you know the leg up output.

59
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,970
I'm sure you know the output.

60
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,530
Um,

61
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,620
off pwd,

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,220
which means home.

63
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,180
I have salsa.

64
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,410
Now,

65
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,890
if I wanted to save you the content of my directory,

66
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,640
I do ls minus l And you see,

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,450
here is a list off all the directories did I have in my home directory.

68
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,190
So I did the same thing as I was doing here by double clicking it.

69
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,060
But right now,

70
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,750
I used a command Ellis.

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,990
So when I use the command,

72
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,490
Alex,

73
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:09,280
I actually am telling my bash shell to do this.

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,650
L s command for me.

75
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,620
Well,

76
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,950
let's do clear.

77
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,120
And it will clear up my terminal.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,850
Now.

79
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,130
If you wanted to see of what other shell that you could,

80
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,720
um,

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,730
change too.

82
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,250
You could just simply type S h and you hit S h.

83
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,690
You see yourself shell prompt changes.

84
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,220
You could also verified by running echo dollar zero and you'll see it is shell.

85
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,850
Now,

86
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,670
if you want to exit out of the shell to go back to your bash,

87
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,250
you type exit.

88
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,900
And if you want to go to,

89
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,430
let's say seashells,

90
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,550
so just type seashell and you are in seashell to confirm your in C Shall you do echo

91
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,960
dollars,

92
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,450
zero seashells.

93
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,060
You want to get out?

94
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,690
What do you get?

95
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,250
How do you do?

96
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,250
You do accent.

97
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,220
So had That's how you get out.

98
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,610
Now,

99
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,980
what other shell that we learned?

100
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,680
Let's say if you want to start a corn shell s que S h hit,

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,050
Enter.

102
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,260
Um,

103
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,190
this is bash.

104
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,950
Corn shall command not found.

105
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,470
This is similar commanders you could use Regency shall know what I want to use corn show

106
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,950
why I cannot get into corn show.

107
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,050
Maybe because I do not have corn shell installed in my computer.

108
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,250
And how do we verify it?

109
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,950
Simply do cat shells.

110
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,410
Okay,

111
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:25,770
tell me,

112
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,150
do you see corn shell in there?

113
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,930
No,

114
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,250
right.

115
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,660
That's why I was not able to start that corn shell.

116
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,750
Ah,

117
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,380
shell,

118
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,010
actually.

119
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,450
So anyway,

120
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,650
so that's how you could switch around chills.

121
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,170
Start a new show again.

122
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,250
This is if you want to get into a different shell environment.

123
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,630
Now,

124
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,520
how does it relate to shell scripting the shot scripting that you want to learn,

125
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,830
right?

126
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,950
That that's what you're probably thinking?

127
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,870
Well,

128
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,050
if you are creating a shell script,

129
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,650
let's it in corn shell.

130
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,040
And as you see right here I don't have corn shell.

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,350
That script is not gonna run.

132
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:11,100
So you need to know your environment beforehand before you spend tons of number of hours

133
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,030
and then realize,

134
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,360
Oh,

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,750
boy,

136
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,640
I don't You would have a corn shell and,

137
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,960
you know,

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,650
even how to install or down on the corner anyway.

139
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,350
Eso That's about changing the shells.

140
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:34,530
One of the basic things that we should know is how to run a shell script.

141
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,950
So when you created there are different ways you could run it,

142
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,060
you can run it through absolute path,

143
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,860
or there's another one that's called relative Path.

144
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,180
So absolute path is if,

145
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,450
let's suppose,

146
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:55,110
if you are standing right at the first step off a steer's and you have to pick up something

147
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,020
on the very last year in the top,

148
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:05,030
you have to actually either shoot from the first year all the way to the last year on top

149
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,830
and grab that thing that you're trying to grab or there's another one.

150
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,750
Another way is relative path.

151
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:19,790
The relative pat is that you actually walk up to the steer and then grab that thing that

152
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,350
you wanted to grab the same way.

153
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,270
Um,

154
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,950
absolute path and relative pat works.

155
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,350
If you do not know what exactly,

156
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,810
absolute path and relative pats ar,

157
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,950
I would recommend you that you should,

158
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,660
you know,

159
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,750
try to look it up online and see what they are and how they work.

160
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,120
And,

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,510
um,

162
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,200
you'll find tons of article there and make sure your type,

163
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,180
Absolute Path and Lennox or absolute path and relative path in Lenox as well.

164
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,520
So the way it works is I have my limits machine up.

165
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,350
Let me log into my Lennox machine,

166
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:05,790
so I have my script right here.

167
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:17,140
It's called X Y Z Dash Screwed if you notice I am in my slash home slash I of Salt and

168
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,850
Slash script directory.

169
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,220
I created a directory called Scripts in My Home Directory on Guy.

170
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,850
Create all my scripts in that directory.

171
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,610
So if I am already in that directory,

172
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,710
I could run the script or if I am not in my directory,

173
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,660
let's say if I just do CD and which directory I'm in,

174
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,950
I'm in slash route.

175
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,550
So the script that I want to run it's just a test group that I created earlier.

176
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,760
That's a few tight death script Name.

177
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,550
X y Z Dash script and then you hit Enter,

178
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,380
you'll see it says Bash the script.

179
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,050
Name Command Not found.

180
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,800
Why?

181
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:06,150
Because the Lenox operating system is trying to find that script and slash root directory.

182
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,250
And I do not have that script in slash root directory.

183
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,430
So I would have to specify the absolute path to run the script.

184
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,980
And the absolute path would be just the same way as if you are standing at the bottom of

185
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,340
the stairs and then you have to fetch something from the top of the stairs.

186
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,050
Then you actually through some kind of means or like a stick or something,

187
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,440
and you could grab it.

188
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,940
So the same way you will specify the entire path,

189
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,850
which is slash home my user directory scripts and now the name of the script.

190
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,380
Now when I run the script,

191
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,050
I'll hit.

192
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:52,050
Enter and you will see is just the script that is actually echo out or print Hello,

193
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,350
world on the screen.

194
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,840
How does this group created?

195
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,750
I will cover that in the later lectures,

196
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,280
but just to focus.

197
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,890
This is how you need to run a script using absolute path.

198
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,240
Now what if you are in a relative path,

199
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,050
which is that you are already in home I of salt and Scripts Directory.

200
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,640
See you CD into that directory.

201
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,950
You do PWD and you'll see the path is the complete paths.

202
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,350
Now.

203
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,500
Now the script name is again when you do Alice,

204
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,840
my cell tr I have the script X y Z script.

205
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,210
Now when you run this group now script and hit,

206
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,750
enter it still cannot find it.

207
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,670
Why?

208
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,640
Because when you are inside off a directory,

209
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,590
you will always have to specify that you want to run the script but than this same

210
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,150
directory.

211
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,950
And that is the relative path.

212
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,080
And to do that,

213
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,650
you have to specify dot,

214
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,370
slash and then the name off the script you could hit Tab.

215
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,750
It will auto complete.

216
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,850
So now you hit enter and you'll see it ran.

217
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,720
So keep that in mind.

218
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,680
There are two ways you could run the script one through absolute path and want to the

219
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,350
relative path.

220
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,740
If you are,

221
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,650
let's say in slash home directory,

222
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,100
and now you want to run the script.

223
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,150
You could still specify the entire past lying home starting my user directory,

224
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,120
or you could just simply start from the director you are in.

225
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,420
So you are an I absolve from from this home onward,

226
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,740
I have saw scripts and the script name hit,

227
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,170
enter.

228
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,600
And you see it works here too,

229
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,250
because you you have to let the opening system know where your script exactly is located.

230
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,620
So that's the basic about scripting how you run it.

231
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,000
So please remember these two main points about running.
