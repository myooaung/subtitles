1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
All right,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,240
guys,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,450
welcome to the lab set up in this section.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,650
We are going to actually set up our lab.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,420
Ah,

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,070
where we will be practicing our scripting skills.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,450
We will be building.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,020
Ah,

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,190
are Lennox machine and we will be creating shell scripts.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,850
So let's see,

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,800
What exactly are we going to do in this lab?

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,200
Set up?

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,450
So this is Ah,

14
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,110
quick,

15
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,150
step by step,

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,620
the instruction of what we're gonna be doing.

17
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,070
Ah,

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,190
following this lesson in this section,

19
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,760
I will be covering about the virtual environment.

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,700
This is for those who actually don't know what water environment is or what a virtual

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,570
machine is.

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,840
So I will be going over some of the fundamentals of virtual environment.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,650
How it works.

24
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,240
Ah.

25
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,280
Then what is,

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,640
um,

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,010
Oracle Virtual box?

28
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,290
So,

29
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:55,640
of course,

30
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,490
inversion environment.

31
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,510
There are so many.

32
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,010
Ah,

33
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,630
were actual products that out there,

34
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,830
there's VM where the orca wardrobe box.

35
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,660
There's Microsoft Works environment.

36
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,710
So which one to pick So in our let lab said of you will be installing Oracle warship box,

37
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,060
and that's where we will be setting up our next lab environment.

38
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,960
So after that,

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,100
we will be installing Oracle War troll box on it.

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,700
Um,

41
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,130
then it's Ah,

42
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,260
it's a complete process.

43
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,640
I have,

44
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,340
actually,

45
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,590
including every single thing in this set up.

46
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,360
So where do you need to get the download file?

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,120
How do you have to install it?

48
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,850
How do you have to configure it?

49
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,270
And then we will cover the first virtual machine.

50
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,600
So once you have the oracle box running,

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,780
then what do you need to do with it?

52
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,760
You need to create a virtual machine.

53
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,210
What is a word from machine?

54
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,100
If you don't know,

55
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,160
then I have covered that in this section.

56
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,470
You don't have to worry about a thing.

57
00:01:53,470 --> 00:02:00,290
I will walk you through step by step and every all the way through on setting up your

58
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,050
Lennox machine.

59
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,240
And then once you have the Lennox machine up and ready,

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,800
then we will do the Lennox installation.

61
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,520
And,

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,790
um,

63
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,720
the Lennox insulation I will be covering is the centre west,

64
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,850
which is exactly like Red Hat Lennox,

65
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,870
which is used mostly in the linen environment in a corporate environment.

66
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,120
So this section covers all about setting up your lab.

67
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,560
Now,

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,470
let me tell you this.

69
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,830
If you already have a lab or if you already have.

70
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:26,970
Ah,

71
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,040
Lennox machine.

72
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,180
Then you do not have to do this entire section.

73
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,180
You could simply skip through it.

74
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,420
You could start up your own Lennox machine that you have.

75
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,350
It's either a bun,

76
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,750
too.

77
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,110
It's either sent OS or red hat.

78
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,110
I would put forward that you go with center Wes and,

79
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,460
um,

80
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,040
and red hat because most of the scripting languages and the shell scripts that I will be

81
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,800
using I was using in bash language.

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,590
If you're lit Knicks opening system understands the bash programming language.

83
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,420
That's fine.

84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,410
You could you could use that.

85
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,030
Um,

86
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,900
if you want to install Lennox from scratch on your physical machine,

87
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,200
you could also go.

88
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,450
You are.

89
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,370
You're more than welcome to do that.

90
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,150
But if you do not have any limits machine than this section is really gonna help you.

91
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,440
And once again,

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,370
if you do have a Lennox machine not to worry about it,

93
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,050
just go straight to the next section.
