00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
Hello.

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.670
Folks will come back in this section.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.350
We are going to see how we can deploy on your docker container using Jenkins.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.010
So here also,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.720
we are going to use Jenkins as they were building the deployment a tool.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.450
And we are going to deploy and Docker container.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.540
So far,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.800
we have our court under gate and Jenkins server is ready.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.750
Next thing is we need to set up our doctor candor.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.760
Let's go and see how to set up darker host to set up over Dr Host,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.520
I have created a document in our documents.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.300
Repository,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.070
We can go there and have a look here we have your folder colder.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.680
Darker.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.470
Go inside.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:44.300
So this and we have dr installation steps in the doctor installation steps we we can

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.200
install doctor on a major ley necks are central areas.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.180
In our case,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.430
I'm going to use a measure,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.800
Lennox,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200
because it's quite simple.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.070
We can install Docker.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.550
Either community arisen Our enterprise it isn't if you are using our hitch ill.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.450
We don't have any community reason for our head.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.370
She'll you must go with enterprise a reason but for imagined inexistent with us,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.090
it is available that is the reason I'm going to use our mission,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.630
Lennox,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.210
where we can directly install our talker for this purpose.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.140
I'm going to lunch.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.400
New.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.660
Easy to instance,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.920
as your doctor host to set up over Docker containers.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950
Let's go to imagine console.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.970
So far,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.230
we help to servers that is Jenkins.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.740
Under time.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.450
Get I'm going to lunch.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.450
New server for Dr Host.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.150
I'm choosing our mission.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.650
Lennix.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.770
Nothing to change over here.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:45.450
Name Dr Most because it is going to host our docker containers.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.750
I learned security group,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.980
same security group.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.450
I'm using launch and same keep it all so amusing.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.380
All right.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.150
Our doctor host is ready Years jumping to Dr Host shish in.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.850
This is huge.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:25.620
You see two minus user recordable toe.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.250
Larkin,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:37.550
increase the fiancee's become your route host to name Dr Host.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.460
I'm name Monetize it.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.770
Dr.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.250
Host again Logging in tow.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.190
Dick,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.650
you defict!

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.470
All right,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.750
clear the screen Now we'll installed um install Darker.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.420
Yes,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.650
I want to install it.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.710
It is going to install Docker community reason installation successful.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.310
No,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.230
let's exude one off the doctor Commander darker PS it to displace all the running

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.920
containers.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.750
Let's see what will happen.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.520
You can see here it is saying that Dr Damon is not running because we haven't started.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.800
Dakar Damon surgeries.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.450
Dr Staters.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.200
Saris.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.350
Doctor start.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.000
I can check for the status.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.930
Now it's running.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.410
If I exude the same command right now,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.550
it will give the output.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.380
But there are no containers right now because it is a fresh shirt up.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.410
We don't have any containers right now.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.860
We need to create our wound containers.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.950
I believe you already know that a docker containers created out off Dockery majors under

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.680
docker images created from their doctor phone.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.540
Initially,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.400
we need to write your doctor friend from Dr Phil.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.280
We should create your doctor Emmys from Dr Image.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.290
We should create your docker container instead off that one.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.650
We can use some of the pretty friendly majors which are available in their Doctor Hope

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.300
Doctor.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.940
How busy registry.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.370
Where?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.850
It has darker images which are created by different people.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.800
Let's jump into a darker heartburn to see what is there in their doctor Hub search for Dr

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.150
Hub.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.950
So this is hub dot docker dot com.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.030
This is what we are going to use so usually if you don't have any majors are.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.780
You don't have any doctor friends.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.570
You can ableto pull some up the doctor images from Docker Hub These images are created by

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.520
official product owners.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.240
Are the people like us can able to store Dockery mazes in docker help?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.550
There are two kinds off registries that is public registry and private registry.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.300
If you want to keep your images privately,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.250
you can use the private repository usually in the industry.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.080
They don't keep their images publicly.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.850
They will always keep the remains is in the private repositories are girls.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.760
They can create their one private repositories to store their images for no Instead

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.070
operating your docker file.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.640
I'm going to take your doctor Remains from the doctor.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.030
Help!

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.920
Let's start for Tom care If you remember,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.440
we have set up your Tom care to VM rather than that we can create a docker container

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.770
directly by pulling the doctor.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:36.230
M is and there are so many options came you can see 21,000 place results came for some

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.740
amazes.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.020
You can see officially Mies turned off for some off them.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.160
There is no you bag on the here.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.730
It will tell you how many don't Lords,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.520
It happens,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.680
officially means nothing but the product.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.790
Warners are going to create this image.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.900
Always prefer to use the officially majors because if you use the unofficial images,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.950
there might be a chance that they may inject some models to you.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.850
Work on dinners,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.250
toe hack your systems.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.050
So it's always best to practice to use the official images.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.790
So let's go and say to Tom Cat and ah,

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.270
to pull the Sim is we are going to executed Docker Pull Tomcat and there are various tax

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.900
for the work.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.230
Tom Guardian is nothing but Washington's.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.710
You can choose any worse,

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.220
and if you need Tom,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.980
get nine.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.400
You can use thes eight if you need these like that,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.710
there are various options.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.950
You can choose any any tax according to your requirement.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.080
If you don't space for uni tag,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.280
it is going to pull the late estimates by the fall on DA.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.890
If you scroll down a little bit,

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.470
it will tell you the how to use this image as well.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.630
So these are the commands of what will you need to execute to pull this amaze,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.000
and the application is going to run on port number Algeria Algeria Internal Linder Doctor

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.550
container.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.940
In our case,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.970
we want to pull the latest to Tom Gertie means and created container out off it before

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.270
pulling.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.750
The aim is literally stole the images.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.550
Docker amaze a list.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.770
We don't have any images.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.310
Docker,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.620
pull Tom Kitt on You can give the tag bag latest.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.320
I'm giving nothing but it is going to pull the latest inmates from the hub dot Doctor not

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.050
come It is a public repository.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.310
If you want to use private repository,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.150
you must like into your repository by using docker large in which we are going to see in

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.450
the later classes.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.010
If we want toe,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.480
pull the images from the private repository You need to log into your docker registry by

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.290
using Docker Lagan This we're going to see in the later radios for no literally started

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.780
docker images either Docker images are Dockery List.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.150
Both are going to give their Dockery mazes.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.750
No,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:58.610
we helped pull your latest er Doc Kareem is we can create a container out off it to create

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.290
a container.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.940
We should exude a commerical darker run minus minus name.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.970
I'm going to name it as a Tom Good Tom Kurt.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.850
Container minus p.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.950
Nothing but on which port number do you want to expose it?

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.240
I want to expose it on port number.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.350
Eijiro Eijiro Internally.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:27.050
Also trans on port number 800 earned Amaze name Tom Kurt Under latest.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.750
If you don't speak sway any attack by deformity to treat it as a latest.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.700
That's six ago did.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:39.540
And it is going to create a docker container under runs in the foreground for grown nothing

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:39.540
,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.550
But we could ableto see that one.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.450
Now let's try to access our Tomcat application from the browser.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.340
For that,

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:53.830
we should take coasts R I P address followed by port number 8080 So let me take the port

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.250
number.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:08.580
How far darker host this is Port Member off Doctor host Colon Joy Jiro Here you can see if

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.350
you are facing this kind of issue.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:16.220
Please keep this lecture on watch next to video other ways you are fined to continue.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:16.750
For that,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.240
we could ableto pull the latest radar Kareem is under.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.250
It's running fine.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.850
No,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.960
if I kill this docker container so if I tried to access it right now,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.580
it won't work now before this pleather Dr.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.210
P s.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.080
Nothing is dead.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.310
Dr.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.550
Pierce minus E.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.150
We have your container breaches and stop listed.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:47.240
So let's remove this one on the recreated new container to remove your docker container

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.050
Darker are him on the current A Not me.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.650
That's creating new container with the same command.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.750
But this time we are going to use minus D option.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.680
These transport detach more so that it want to display in the friend.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.570
And now you can exclude Commander called the Doctor PS.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.950
You can see a Tomcat container which is running on defy.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.100
Refresh it again.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.050
It should work.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.940
All right.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.610
Our docker container is working in next video.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.990
I'm going to show you what Kendall Prerequisites.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.250
We need to set up toe deploy on your docker container.
