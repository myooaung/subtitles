00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Hello Folks will come back So far,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.570
we have set up this environment.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.450
Nothing better.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.310
All settled.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.540
Deploy any Veum we have so score available in Gate Onda,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.970
We have Jenkins server which successfully ableto build over sore scored on We have target

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.140
in government called Tomcat Server which is readily available now let's integrate.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.810
Our tomcats are with the Jenkins so that we can never to deploy on Tomcats are were I'm on

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.500
my Jenkins a dashboard to install on your William We should have you additional plug in

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.250
called deploy toe container.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.800
So far we haven't installed that plug in So let's go on the install dirt Go to manage

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:57.850
Jinkins manage begins available Soto reply on any William we should have deployed to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.420
container even though it is er another application server So I'm installing deployed toe

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.450
container Plug in right it's installed successfully Go back to Jenkins home pace.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.550
Now we are going to create a new job to deploy on our Veum.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:29.490
I'm going to name it as ah deploy on Tomcat server.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.280
So deploy on your time kids There were This is a Mavin project.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.850
OK,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.850
I'm doing deploy on William.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.950
I'm giving description as deeply on Veum.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
We should provide a repository world Go back!

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:00.430
Hello world Copy the repository World under No Nieto Proper credentials Master Branch

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.450
Nothing to change.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:11.920
Do you mean installed back is next Once Billy successful,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.350
we want to deploy it for that post build accents.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.060
You can see a option called Deploy.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.990
Where are our two year container?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.910
If you don't install deploy toe container plugging,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.360
You cannot see this option now Here.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.960
Asking for the where file click on question marks so that it provides some information.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.500
Okay,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.250
We should provide the var file information.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.190
Usually it stores under the workspace with this name.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.360
So under that,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.840
whatever Where file is there?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.950
We want to pick it up.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.010
In our case,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.490
our valuable name is way back,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.830
Doctor,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.090
where?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.110
If you are not clear about your river file name,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.470
you can just to provide the start.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.410
Start slash started out where?

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.620
So that it picks up whatever we're failed.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.550
Its creates under this folder.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.610
So nobody's let it be started out.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.460
Where next are broken?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.880
Dinner.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.940
If you see the options over here,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.330
you can deploy up to maximum Tomcat.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.510
Eight.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.530
That is the reason I have installed a Tomcat eight instead of Tom Kurt nine.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.150
So let's take this one.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.800
No credentials to deploy on Our Tomcats are world Tomcats are worse Would accept Jenkins

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.960
authentication If you remember,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.920
we have created a couple off users from those We are going to use a user called Deploy

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.150
there.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.230
So let's go back to our Tom gets or work.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:44.870
Here we have your file called cart slash War PT Tom Kurt con Tom Curtis is a start.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.880
XML if you remember,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.230
we have other couple off users over here.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.950
We are going to use a user called or deploy there.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.050
So let's copy it and possible Altered a player.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.550
He is added to year old called manager script.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.850
So add Jenkins.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.490
User name and password Also seem I really a bilge.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.150
You deploy a user description,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.960
Use it toe deploy on Tom.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:28.810
Kurt Veum hard and we are choosing this user under Tom Qwerty Wirral Our surgery is this

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.050
one.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.790
This is our time cards.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.200
Sorry,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.650
Worrell,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.350
Go back here and property.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.690
So no,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.470
I'll play the changes.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.250
Save it.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.010
No.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.150
We helped created your job called the Deploy on Tomcat Server.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.640
Whenever we exclude this job.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.470
It is going toe copy where file onto target tankers are work on the well doing that when it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.850
authenticates by using deploy a user.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.060
So everything is said under on Tomcats that we're usually leader deep.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.480
All to location is rebel.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.350
Let's go on to see that.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.410
So go inside to slash PT.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.790
Tom,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.150
Kurt.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.810
Here we have you directly called were perhaps on the ls Manus.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.010
Ellie,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.300
Peg,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.150
you here.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
We have defaulted Tomcat application.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.100
So that is what we are accessing from the browser.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.590
Now,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.190
whenever we run that job,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.050
it is going toe copy of our fell into this location.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.260
Okay,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.850
so let's go on the execute our job,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.250
build a No.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.520
Hopefully it gets success.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.650
Open the council or put,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:46.550
we'll wait until it gets completely cool.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.390
It got completed successfully.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.410
Only if you see here.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.190
It has deployed on the target in war.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.070
Mental tomcat,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.900
A dart eggs.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.310
Let's go and see.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.060
I'm giving ls minus.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.210
L Yep.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.180
You can see Aware File Where?

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.370
Back,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.760
Doctor.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.100
Where?

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.700
Now we want to access this application to access this application we need to give.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.680
Ah,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.470
you were careful.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.500
Name in the browser.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.150
Let's go.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.650
Apache Tomcat.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.880
Er if I refresh it,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.850
it's working on da slash rebel to access our application.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.380
Here you go.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.250
You can see here.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.020
Hello.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.850
Welcome to simple develops project.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:34.140
This is how you can ableto deploy a var fell Anya Veum in next video I'm going to show you

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.950
How can you build happens automatically Whenever there is a change in the court,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.330
It looks a little interesting.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.450
See you there.
