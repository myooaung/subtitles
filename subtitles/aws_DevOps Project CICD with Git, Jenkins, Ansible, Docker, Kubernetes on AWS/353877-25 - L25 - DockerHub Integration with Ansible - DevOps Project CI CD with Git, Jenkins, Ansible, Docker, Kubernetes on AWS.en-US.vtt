00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
Hello,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.530
folks.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.850
Welcome back.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.230
So far we have set up our environment toe deploy on your docker container which is running

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.950
unanswerable.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.650
But our purposes we want to deploy it on target hosts nothing but which are managed by

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.250
answerable.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.350
In our case,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.380
it may be one server,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.780
but in real world answerable May has to deploy on hundreds off servers to manage this kind

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.560
off deployments effectively,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.250
we are going to use one more tool called Docker hub.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.030
So whenever we build any maze,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.250
usually we will store that amazing the doctor,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.510
huh?

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.390
So we are going toe push our doctor in May's into darker help Under Dr Hub can have the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.000
collection off all the majors on Whenever we try to deploy and target environment the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.520
target environments pull story miss from the doctor hub on create It's one contain it so

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.470
that we can see all the images are centralized in the doctor Help We don't need to store in

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.800
our local systems whenever we want to deploy on any system that a target system just

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.080
connect or darker help under pull stream is so we are going to configure same thing in our

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.980
environment to do that one.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.850
We should create a doctor her back on.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.450
I have already created one for this demo.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.190
I will just to log into my doctor her back on trying to show you.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.620
If you don't have your doctor,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.750
how back onto please go on to create it.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.390
I held jumping toe Have dark,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.250
darker that come.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.690
This is the doctor have website.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.350
If you don't have an account,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.360
you can go on create by signing up onto Docker hub on probably with information so that you

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.830
can able to create an accord.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.740
I have already created an account so I can log in by using signing my account name is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.550
wearing kills.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.510
This is a fresh record.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.980
So far,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.350
I haven't created anything.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.300
If you want,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.740
you can create a repository.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.050
But I don't create repository from here.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.510
I will create your doctor Imation,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.690
push over here so that we can see a new report.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.160
It really makes here by default.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.490
You can create one private repository on the remaining all our public In real world,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.350
we never start over amazes in the public repository until it doesn't help confidence your

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.820
data.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.620
Otherwise,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.120
most of the cases we use private repositories.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.730
But we are doing demos,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.580
so either we would be fine for us.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.210
So we are going toe came to use publicly positives because if we need private repository,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.430
we need to enable authentication toe access.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.350
Anyway,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.700
let's jump into a principal server and push on the Maison toe darker.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.730
Hope I am on my answerable server now really start Wharton Dolly mazes are there so far,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.050
we don't have any images.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.400
Let's create a new images.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.450
I'm going to run instable playbook,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.850
man to say who's simple develops project so it should be able to create a enemies.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.350
Let ignoring because there is no containers are images.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.200
That's what we have done.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.240
If it is not,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.630
did,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.150
it is going to ignore it.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.100
If we don't add ignore errors command,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.750
then it is going to fail.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.260
I already know relentlessly.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.840
Start to docker images we have a simple develops in is I could PS minus here.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.050
It's created a contaminants that was clear the screen.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.920
Now to push our image in to get her back on,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.650
we should add prefix off our account so that it comes to know that we are pushing.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.750
This theme is to dis accord.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.350
That's how we can tag agreements to attack over the miss.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.950
We should use a commander called the doctor.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.780
Tag the maze name.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.430
Which team is do you want to attack?

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.150
I want to attack this image on what is the new name?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.600
Where kills a slash simple develops image.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.410
If I entered this one,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.950
it's creating a new doctor image.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.880
This is new dock.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.370
Kareem is just copy off.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.560
We were Dockery Mies.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.950
But the name is where Uncle Simple develops maze.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.950
No,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.450
we can push this image unwto over Dr Hub.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.600
But to push this image to Dr Hub you need to authenticate you itself so that it allows you

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.050
to put statements we thought authenticate.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.320
If you try to push it,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.440
Docker push,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.230
It will throw you an error that you don't have permission.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.750
Yes,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.950
So toe push every miss.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.580
First we need to log into our doctor to log into our doctor.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.870
According to Dr Larkin,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.220
is the command it asks for user name were kills why?

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.850
And killed.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.790
Probably password.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.930
Now you have logged into a where according to know same command I makes good in tow.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.650
Pushed Amy's See?

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.950
Here it is tryingto copy the mission to Dr Host Once it is pushed toward Docker host,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.080
we we can see another doctor.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.180
Hope so.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.700
Go back to order Doctor Hub If you re fresh,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.850
you can see where ankle simple develop Siemens has been pushed on.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.750
It is your public That's not a problem We don't have any important data in this.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:41.220
Let it be public So even you can pull this image if you need it Now go back to over Console

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:54.520
again Now I'm going to remove him is from the local system Dr Out of my still no problem

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.770
Because we have our doctor Amazing!

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:05.960
Over Docker Hub Dr Police The command on the followed by You were fully Mei's name Now

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.150
again you couldn't see Dockery Mrs Available This is how we can pull the minutes.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.860
But we want to pull the misto.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.020
The other answerable claim systems Nothing but managed hosts on the In our case the doctor

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.710
host is our manager system.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:29.050
Let's jump into Dr Host earned do the same thing I'm connecting to Dr Host I have logged

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.050
into my doctor host system Let's switch to any said Min because we are going to do

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.850
operations as a In a statement,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.580
we will see I really because it is not attitude Doctor Group it so let's add this one to

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:54.560
darker group user marred minus c A g darker the n s apartment against which back to

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.060
Instagram I Really?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.500
Yes.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:07.510
Now it is a better doctor Group three of the screen darker images so we don't have any

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.990
minute.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:21.310
Now let's pull the Miss Docker pull Name his name You May is in him so called ableto pull a

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.920
mess because it is available in public repository.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.280
If it is in private,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.250
you should ableto indicate.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:37.610
Usually industry uses private repositories rather than public Dr Images.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.010
Yes.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.100
Now you can create container out off.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.290
All right,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.350
so everything is set up toe exude our job.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:50.410
But we need to rate our answerable playbooks rather than turning these commands manually so

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.350
that we can able to automate over stuff.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.460
Thanks for watching this video in next week I will show you how to write our modify our

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.130
answerable playbooks to work with this until then by Syria
