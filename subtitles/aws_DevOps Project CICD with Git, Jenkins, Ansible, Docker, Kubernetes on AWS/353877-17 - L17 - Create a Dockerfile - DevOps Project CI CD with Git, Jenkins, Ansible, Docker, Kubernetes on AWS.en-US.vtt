00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
Hello.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.840
Folks will come back in this video.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.870
I'm going to show you how to rate your simple docker file.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.960
In previous video,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.250
we have seen how we can copy artifact from Jenkins to Dr Host.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.340
Currently,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.770
I'm under my doctor Admin Home directory where you can see we were up,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.090
Doctor.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.410
Where?

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.030
No way.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.740
Want to copy this rebel doctor?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.980
Where?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.780
Until Docker container for that purpose.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.850
I'm going to right here,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.100
Backer file,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.350
which can create your Tomcat server on the host of this rare file.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.950
Let's start three a Dr file,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.430
so D must be caps on DA.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.330
This is the sin decks.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.120
You must use the same name from I'm using.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240
Commander called from going toe.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.110
Pull Tom Kitt.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.070
So it is going to pull Tom card latest Tom,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.250
get the latest wash in from public docker registry.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.360
Next main to not I can give your shankar,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.550
then copy.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.370
So what I'm doing Novas.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.510
I'm copying my e.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.380
Verify my carefully is available in the current location on the powerful name is we're back

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.970
Dr Bad.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.150
And we must copy this one Underwear baps directory.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.910
So if it is a very,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.150
um,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.250
it is the part of very Windstar liver Tomcat.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.740
But if it is a container,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.150
that default location is slash serious up local.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.530
Tom,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.650
get this is the part under this we have were perhaps.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.880
Okay,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.560
this is the directory where we should copy our of air for I'm saving this.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.770
Well,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.850
nothing toe ad.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.550
Dr.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.250
Pierce,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.170
you're less okay.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.440
We have Dr Pile as well as very fell in the current location.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.170
Let me build emails out off this toe.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.900
Build images darker build Dr Building Dynasty.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.140
Nothing but a tag.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.750
I'm giving daggers here.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.800
There were hopes project dot dot Nothing,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.090
but in current location,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.380
check for their doctor friend on the Billy Mays.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.050
Out off that.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.050
As I said from Docker file,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.430
we are going to create a doctor.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.250
Ramiz from Dockery means we are going to create docker container.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.380
So it is pulling the initial Tomcat latest team is take this.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.810
Wear fell under build a new images that new remains name.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.250
We get the wops project.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.390
Let's see the images,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.700
Dr.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.330
Images.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.610
Now you can see two images are there.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.010
This is the base images which we help pulled from public doctor repository on the creator

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.870
New images which cowed of our fellas.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.120
Well,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.250
inside toe this.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.150
Now let's no,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.280
let's create container out off this darker.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.450
Let me clear the screen.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.150
Doc could run Dr Ron Minus minus name.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.510
There were UPS.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.240
Develops containers minus p.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.150
Port number.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm exposing eight on port number,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.900
age rate zero and internally.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.230
Also,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140
it runs on port number,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.240
Age rate zero.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.770
Andi Mei's name Dr Project.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.670
This is the limit.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.320
So it creates here container by using Docker project he made.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:44.500
Let's try to access it from browser Take the appear to It's up over the doctor host Colon

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.750
Eijiro er Jiro.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.070
Okay,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.250
it's running on my we could able to access on they figure slash rib.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.800
Yes.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.180
Whatever is dead in the application,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.550
we could able to access it.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.290
So this is how we can create a container out off our images?

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.540
Only fig you control.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.290
See Onda Now if I refresh,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:18.690
it weren't accessible way because the container reason Stop state I can return it by minus

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.420
d option before we running it.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:34.120
I need to delete it darker PS minus E Dougherty Autumn I had a mode of it World container.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.590
No,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.110
let's create it again.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.730
But this time I'm going to use minus D option minus day.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.350
Nothing better.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.650
Detach more so that it runs in the background.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.880
Darker piers.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.900
It shows that running containers docker ps minus Here it shows all the containers respect

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.200
toe off.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.990
It is running or in stop straight.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.150
Let's access it again.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.080
Yep.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.870
This time again,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.850
it is accessible.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.760
We don't help in issue.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.550
Right?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.490
All right,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.150
this is fine.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.830
Now I'm going to set up a C A serie pipe land where it will create your hair.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.150
Fell under the place directly on your docker container.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.820
How can we do that?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.650
One will see in the next video.
