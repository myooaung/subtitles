00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello Folks will come back in last year.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.390
We have seen hotel Copy artifact under Dr Host in this video.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm going to show you How can we d play?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.090
Careful on Docker container for that purpose.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.950
I'm going to use the same job.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.710
Deploy on Docker by modifying little bit.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.650
Let's jump in tow Our Jenkins console,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.620
Onda Uh,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.250
yes,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.270
This is our deploy on Docker.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.150
Let's create a new job.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.600
Deploy on container and I will copy though the information from deploy on docker.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.150
Okay,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.300
I'm changing it.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.950
Dozy Conde not get hope should be seen.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.540
Get repository water.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.570
Let's see And the build also I'm not changing anything and we are going toe push our Rafael

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.310
under darker host Once it is available in the darker host,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.830
we need to create you amaze out off it toe Create a mazel tov feet.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.040
We need to run some of the doctor comments.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.070
Those comments we are going to execute from the publisher of residents so that those

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.150
comments created Dr Mayes on dear docker container for that purpose.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:30.200
Let's aria command go to insert two slash home dr are mean Then create any meals Docker

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.600
build minus D you may his name.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.150
I'm giving the wops images.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.350
Develops him is from dart.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.880
Once images created,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.710
we need toe create a server.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.150
So,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.680
Dr Carter run minus D.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.380
Nothing better.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.950
Detached mold minus name.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.550
They were ups.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:11.350
Conde Note export on port number A joy Jiro internally runs on port number Jiro Jiro from

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.210
they were ups e mais Alright.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.150
So what we are doing is once very freely is copied onto a target system.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.940
It going said toe the home directory onder under docker build minus t develop seem is it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.280
creates a team is called develops emails then also create a container called develops

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.050
container by using the image whatever we create.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870
Okay,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.940
Now let's save this one on legs,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.650
go to the job,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.950
play Su.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.910
So before executing,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430
this one will go on check.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.800
Is there any measures our country notes out of there?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.250
Fruit of blue D.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.050
Unless we have Docker file and we're friends,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:06.440
let's remove our fail so it should create a new one whenever we exclude the job next to the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.990
news.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.750
Dr.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.820
Pierce Menace here.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.050
No container,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.720
darker images we have.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.550
Your name is Doctor Artemis removing this amiss.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.270
So it's clean right now.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.250
Clear the screen.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.830
Let's go back to overthink in service.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.250
Building this job.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.810
So this time,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.730
what should happen?

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.760
It should be able to create a careful careful get copies onto the target system.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.930
Onder Jenkin server is going to run.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.880
Couple of comments on the target system,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.220
that is.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.890
It goes in,

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.710
say two Dr.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.470
Admin account on Creative Emmys.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.560
Dr.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.290
Pierce,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.950
Dr PS minus here.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.570
Dr.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.950
Kurt,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.690
the majors.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.970
We got a new images 100.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:05.320
Dr.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.040
Pierce Menace.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.260
See,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.030
we got new container as well.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.870
Let's access it from the browser on.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.250
Our job is successful.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:21.220
So container Dr Host type Beatrice Colon.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.440
We have exposed it on port number Gero Gero.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.920
Okay,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.850
Apache default pays is working.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.570
Revved up if I do.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.670
Oh,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.170
yes,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.650
we could able to see this one.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.780
All right.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.910
This is how we can deploy on your container by using Jenkins now assumes that there is a

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.950
change in the court.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.740
Onda,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.150
we have to create a new were fell indicated to deploy into your target involvement.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.760
So assuming that there is a new court on,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.300
let me try to build it.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:08.480
So it's Trento build so you can see here it's built.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.060
The new var fell.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.150
It's copied the where fell under target environment on trying to build under deploying a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.030
new container.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.880
But problem here is there is already a container called the Web's container running on the

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.850
system so you cannot able to deploy a new container with the same name.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.070
So what I'm trying to say is Jenkins cannot able to manage deployments properly.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.510
That is where we need to look after further some of the deployment of tools which are

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.650
available in the market.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.230
So to overcome this kind of problems,

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.550
we are going to use answerable as our deployment a tool from next lecture.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.160
So in the next lecture,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.600
I'm going to show you how to set up and tipple on How can we ableto are just these kind of

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.050
problems in the and simple.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.470
On another problem here it the Jenkins sees.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.660
I'm deploying on your target environment,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.160
which I have registered our Jim started.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.680
You have hundreds of systems where you need to deploy.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.300
I you need to resist all those systems with other Jenkins,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.650
which is your difficult task.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.080
This kind of problems cannot be ableto a chewable through the Jenkins if you aren't you.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.820
Also there is a so much work you need to do hand sport.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.490
We are going to use Jenkins only as a bill.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.330
Little for the deployment purpose we are going to use and simple.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.090
So answer will take this were pill under Deploys it to India.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.930
Target environment of whatever we space for.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.650
We are going to see how it is going to happen in the next video.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.030
Until then.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.670
See you.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.200
Bye.
