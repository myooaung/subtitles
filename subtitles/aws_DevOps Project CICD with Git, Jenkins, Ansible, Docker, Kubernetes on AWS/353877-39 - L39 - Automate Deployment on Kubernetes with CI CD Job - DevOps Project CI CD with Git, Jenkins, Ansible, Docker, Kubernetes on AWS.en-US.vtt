00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
Hello,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.560
friends.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.350
Welcome back.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.850
This is my last two practical session in this video's tutorial.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.870
So far,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.970
we have set up whatever is required toe deploy an kubernetes cluster.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.020
In this video,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.370
I'm going to show you how to deploy an Coburn.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.690
It is automatically without touching anything.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.410
For this,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.270
we need to modify our answerable playbook's a little bit so that whenever there is any

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.740
change,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.550
it creates the new images.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.750
Push that amazing to Dr Hub at the same time it initiate their deployment.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.700
Deployment can ableto pull late estimates on determinate world parts on creating new parts

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.700
.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.550
How we can able to do that one bill jump in and see.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.640
So to make sure we all are in same place,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.650
I'm going to remove all my deployment on services from the kubernetes cluster.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.860
Okay,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.690
first time removing service cube,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.350
CTL delete surgeries.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.390
Service name similar.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.650
Here cubes CTL delete deployed under deployment name.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.350
And also to remove stop parts as well.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.650
So we don't help any parts.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.650
It is terminating.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.550
We don't have any deployments and we don't help any services.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.350
All right,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.910
now,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.440
as I said,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.190
we need to update our court a little bit to make sure that all the process should work

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.150
Before updating our court,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.150
Make sure that we are a cube city awash in wondered 15 That is the minimum worship to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.380
execute these comments because we are using your future called rollout protest ever.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.160
Cube City awash in cube,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.450
CDO Washington.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.880
Okay,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.640
if you see here our cube CD Elise at washing one dot Well,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.690
I want to upgrade it to upgrade.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.130
We can follow the same document which we use it to install on our woman to system.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.350
Let's jump in.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.860
Okay,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.730
Not her level.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.060
Yep.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:30.150
Simple develops Project Gotoku Bernadis community set up.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.590
And here we have instructions how to install Cube City l Same thing we are going to follow

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.730
because it pulls the latest worship.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.150
Let me do that.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:56.250
But Stone lorded giving the exertion permission and copy this one on too.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.150
What us?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.950
Our local bin.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.710
No,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.450
Let me execute the same command.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.220
Okay,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.710
this time we are washing 1.1 play.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.700
This is one thing you need to do.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.600
Next thing is operating Velox It deployed out way mill answerable playbook If you remember

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.260
correctly,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.840
we haven't copied all the playbook.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.100
Well copying this one.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.300
We,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.010
mr some portion on.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.750
I was saying that we can update this one later.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.540
That is what we need to do.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.850
Let me open this well,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.150
so you can see here.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.750
I have greater strategy on the image pull policy in this playbook.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.370
I will show you it from the get hub repository playbook.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.550
Let's go there.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.020
So relax.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.130
See?

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.870
Deployment.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.030
If you remember,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.810
we were not copying this ruling.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.850
Upgrade strategy.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.340
So I have updated this rolling updates strategy on also we were not having this image pull

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.450
policy always.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.870
What does it mean?

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.970
That whenever it creating new part make sure that it pulls the latest emits from the get

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.850
help repository.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.680
So those two we have updated over here.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.380
So this is done on the next thing is even our playbook.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.450
Also you play go back true,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.700
but it is earned our playbook.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.850
This is Relax a deployment playbook.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.800
We were having to tasks.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.190
We have carpet only one on dime.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.210
Adding this task to our playbook.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.790
If you see here we have your commander called Rollo to restart.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.050
Whenever we executed this comment,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.770
our world parts get stopped on the pull.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.470
The latest team is because we have given image full policy always.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.530
So it pulls the late estimates on to start the new container.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.060
This command is not available in Cube City.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.470
L wonder to want to worship.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.220
That's way I have greater Our Cube city awash in next.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.350
Copy this task on update aranzabal playbook.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.950
So go back onto answerable system.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.390
Let's hope another word Reiko Bernadis will accede.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.150
Deployment?

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.650
I'm adding new task over here.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.010
Yes,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:21.170
Let me give this space for between these two tasks alignment is fine.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.550
Don't save it.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.450
We have set up everything to automate our deployment.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.390
So know what I'm going to do?

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.970
I will come here are in the market for the index Start Jsp court.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.750
Whenever we modify it,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.260
we could able to see the new image getting built on that emits get pushed into over Dr Hub

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.260
.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.520
So currently it is.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.220
We're not one.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.250
Let me see.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.110
Yeah,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.420
Current treaties were not one.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.970
It is going toe push one more.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.660
Dockery means once the docker images pushed our Cuban,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:04.040
it is cluster can able to identify and pull the maze and creative part out of it cubes.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.100
It'll get parts city looking to deploy Cube.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.750
Sit here,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.350
kid service.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.750
Okay,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.320
let's go and execute our continuous integration on the continues deployment jobs and see

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:29.170
the result using danceable for Relax,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.320
eat technologies.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.850
I'm just update on my court.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.260
Let's are this court.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.650
Get tired.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.650
Get comet,

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.820
get push.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.910
I helped push my cord.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.750
Okay,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.000
let's see.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.950
Comments should be 24.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.810
Yes,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.350
then.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.510
Bill,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.830
wait.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.650
This job get initiated.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.150
Alert or job is initiated.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:27.040
Let me open in new tab Opening this so initially copyist of our failing to this location as

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.150
usual process.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.850
Okay,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.650
It's corporate bear friend on the creator.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.290
The Emmys?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.450
Almost.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.590
Yeah,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.790
pushing the image because it's created.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.450
You can see the docker images on answerable system.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.260
Okay.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.660
Pushed under the litter as well on request.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.040
See that,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.570
Major,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.050
we're here.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.880
We can see when not to.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.960
And also it's going to exclude Siri's up.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.350
Hopefully it might be completed by this time.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.350
Yeah,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.080
Completar.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.840
Now let's go and see the over deployment.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.360
Yes,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.350
we got one deployment 27 seconds ago.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.450
Our service just 33 seconds ago.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.670
UN reports 39 seconds ago.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.150
Okay,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.890
No,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.550
let's access over application.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:37.410
So Cuban or these masters are already Colon,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.400
31,200.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:39.750
Right.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.650
We can see this port over here.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:50.150
31,200 slash rebel.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.070
Yes,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.390
we can see here deployment on kubernetes.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.500
Using principle for galaxy technologies.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.480
I'm going to marry for our court one more time so that we can check one more last for

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.150
deployment.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.550
It should replace our existing parts with a new one.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.080
So do that one.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.250
Let's jump into our Jenkins over to Marty.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:18.290
Pay over court hitched to one.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.850
Lost.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.350
But an idea.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:33.180
I'm pushing this court now.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.350
I don't touch anything over here.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.250
Within a couple of minutes,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.760
our job should get execute under.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.610
Pull the latest court on creating a new part out off that by replacing the world ones on I

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.650
can able to access our new application from the browser.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.250
That is what I'm expecting from this job.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.050
Let's wait and see what is going to happen.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.970
Build the number 12 is executing?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:59.250
No.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:11.960
So build a number 12 is executing danceable level.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.350
You can see the images this time.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.450
Kurtz already pushed.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:23.810
I think you can see the letters to inmates.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.550
Pretties A villepinte?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.250
Yep.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.210
Let estimates,

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:35.410
because we have multiple jobs that might be creating our Ismael pushes on.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.650
Let me refresh it.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.100
Yes,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.450
we can see that our latest comet has been update.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.850
Er this is how we can deploy on kubernetes without touching anything.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.420
So as a commuter are the starting off this lecture as the dollar per I helped pushed my

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.580
according to get her.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.690
Jenkins has taken the court from get her on,

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:01.650
exude the see a job through the sea a job answerable can ableto get the airfoil creating a
