00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
Hello.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.350
Folks will come back in this video.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.340
I'm going to show you how we can integrate our doctor host with *** in server so that

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.740
Jenkins can able to copy the verify lander Dark reversed from docker host to treat Can able

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.550
to copy under Docker Container.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.180
For that purpose,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
we need to install the A plug in called to publish Over Associate on our Jenkins Our work.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.640
After that,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.860
we need to store credit sells off our darker host on our Jenkins server so that Jenkins Air

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.350
working able to authenticate with their doctor host.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.350
Let's go on to do that one.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.050
I'm jumping onto my Jenkin server.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.150
So this is our Jenkins console here.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.250
Go to manage Jenkins to install new plug in under this man is plug ins available plug ins.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:57.870
Let's search for publisher over this church publish over.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.610
Research it.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.900
So it is installing publisher over.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.420
Shh.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.350
Plug in installation is successful.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.950
Go back.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.070
We need to add our doctors.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.650
Our work read in cells over here.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960
For that purpose,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.850
I'm going to create a user called a Dark Aardman in our doctors server.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.940
Clear this screen user,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.390
Add Dr Argument and create a password for this one.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.970
Doctor Aardman All right,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.310
I have said the password.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.990
This user must be part off darker group carts.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.670
Lessee to see cats less.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.800
It is a group you can see A group called the Doctor is Did We must have our this user toe

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.660
This group so user marred My no c a g docker Docker Aardman,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.190
I have other This user to Dr Redmond Group I d Dhaka.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.600
Rodman,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600
if you see Yes,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.150
he is part off his wound group as well as Dr Group.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.300
Now this doctor credentials we should provide in the Jenkin server.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.250
Let's go back to Jenkins.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.850
Go to manage Jenkins Configure system.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.250
And if you scroll down here,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.690
there is the option called publish over.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.450
Shh.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.250
We are going to our estate servers.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.100
And here we should provide the name off over server.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.250
Let's go back.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.860
I'm going to give the I P address,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.030
so I peer toes off the surgeries this one on Did can able to communicate with the private

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.020
APIs name.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.710
I'm going to give that their doctor host on the host name.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.500
I'm going to give the I P address and user name.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.480
I'm goingto provide it as there darker aren't mean are advanced on the use.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.380
The password based authentication toe.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.750
Communicate this and you should probably the password.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.780
So I'm giving parcelled off.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.910
Dr.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.450
Rodman,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.430
once it is provided,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.850
test the connection.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.250
Okay,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.250
It's failing because we need to enable the password based that indication on our server by

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.580
default on easy to instances,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.500
it is not enabled to enable that one.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.530
We should go to a slash C t.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.740
C.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.650
S a search.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.640
This is hit d underscored convict.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.150
Under this file there is Yeah,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:53.640
password authentication is saying No,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.050
We need to enable it to Yes,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.530
so that from now one works,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.860
users skin able to log in and we should restart.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.150
We should restart associate service.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.550
So hence service associated E between Lord.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.300
All right,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.040
it's done.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.150
Let's go back and the test it again.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.430
This time it is success.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.050
Okay?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.550
I play and save it.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.110
So far,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.740
we have set up Jenkins under docker integration.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.950
In next video,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.550
we will create a Jenkins job to deploy and your doctor server Until then by
