00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
Hello,

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.450
folks.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.160
So far we have installed Jenkins.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.810
After that,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.450
we set up Get on Mavin Now we are going to create a new job toe Execute your Maren build

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.800
further to let's create a new item under this If you remember initially we could ableto see

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.210
only priest trail after installation off Navin,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:32.150
you could CDA Mavin Project build option as well So let me name it as a my first my program

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.920
build We are just going toe Do build Onda,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.070
select a Mavin project OK now go build it Mavin We should have sort scored If you remember

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.570
We have so scored available in other way ankles A cone the repository name called Hello

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:02.600
World Let's go back and grab that one So go back toe wearing killed Hello world And here

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.450
you can see Cloner Don't Lord,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.800
this is the You were really unit toe copy and go back to our Jenkins home pays description

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.800
.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:21.380
My real name it as their plus two Maren Maren boomed next under source scored management

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.400
See here we have installed Get plug indoors where you could see the option to choose Get on

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.410
the well choosing get You need to provide the repository you world Nothing but where

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.150
exactly the core does exist.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.280
In our case,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.730
the court is exist under way and killed second and provide the credentials.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.700
It is a public repositories So no need to provide any cred in cells.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.410
If it is a private repository,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.200
we must to provide credit sales toe proper credentials.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.880
Even we must add it under Jenkins,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.870
I will show you in the little associations how we can add crude insults for other purpose.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.400
Onda Branch,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.240
we are pulling this court from the master branch.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.660
If we go toe over,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.590
get Herb Repository You can see the branches.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.210
The Master,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.550
We're pulling the court from Master Branch.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.200
Then we have you build well building.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.580
Mavin should request your palm Read XML.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.300
This bombed out XML also should be available in the repository.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.700
If you see here there is a file called a palm dot XML.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.700
This while is nearer to build using marriage and ah,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.310
golds and options.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.640
I hope you know there are various goals to build with Mavin But in our case,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.690
we stripped with 18 install Pakis.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.670
Okay.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.850
These are the goals I'm using after build.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.320
We're not choosing anything because we are just going toe test.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.250
How build is goingto happen.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.570
True.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.850
Mavin up Lee Su.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.350
Now we can execute our job by choosing option Called the building.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.600
No.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.260
If you want to change your job,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.850
go to configure only irritable job.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.210
Here you can change it.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.260
Nothing to edit.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.150
In my case,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.880
go back,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.350
build the job on the building history you can see here,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.840
and this is our fast to build.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.670
Let's open the consular.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.950
Put.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.000
If you are doing build a faster time,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.110
then it takes a little longer time because it has two.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.750
Don't know all the dependencies.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.050
Let's wait until this job good completes because it has few test cases as well.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:50.270
You can see here it's processing over test cases.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.850
Usually test cases are written by the dollar purse.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.980
Alright,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.190
so our buildings success.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.550
No issues so far.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.300
In case off any failures,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.450
you can refer to this output so that they were going to get the information.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.900
Go back to overbuild.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.720
It is bluebell.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.100
Nothing,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.150
but it is successful.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.700
If you see here,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.630
you can find your folder called workspace.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.240
Over here.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.210
Whenever you run any job,

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.940
Jenkins,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.650
copy your court under workspace directory on the build,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.450
even the outcomes up that build also keeps under this location.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.750
If you see here,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.040
here we have that some of the files on.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.940
And if you go back,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.230
they were.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.570
Hello,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.460
World Repository.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.440
You can see the same content over here.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.390
Nothing but it copied into workspace directory.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.340
Under this,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.200
you can see rebel under targets usually under targets.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.550
The outcome off our build can be stored.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.340
So here you can see where Beppe doctor where?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.550
Because it is a republication.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.950
So it's created a of our file whenever we build it.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.860
All right,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560
you can see the same thing from me.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.230
Were Jenkins sincerely as well?

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.040
Goatee were drinking server on DA Usually it will be available.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.250
Underclass,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.720
verily live Jenkins workspace.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.140
This is the default party.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.330
Forgive ls So far we have ran two jobs.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.550
You can see my post jobs my first mavin build.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.750
If I go inside toe this,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.750
you can see the same content.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.840
Docker file is their beach.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.050
We're going to use in the later classes palm dot xml read on the goto,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.050
then target.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.950
Consider web app dot There.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.850
Now we have you Careful,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.330
but we don't have any target environmental to host this rebel.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.000
That where?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.440
So in the next video,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.350
we are going to set up your Tomcat server to host this web app.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.920
That where,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.890
until then Bye,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.550
see you there.
