00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
Hello Prince will come back in previous lecture We have set up over answerable to execute

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.020
deployment on services on target system.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.060
Now we should execute the playbooks and see what is going to happen under Kubernetes

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.620
cluster.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.940
Before executing,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.680
I will jump into my kubernetes cluster on removed.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.350
All the resource is which were created earlier.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.140
Clear the screen cube,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.740
CTL gift ports cube,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.870
CTL get or deployments Deploy cube,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.170
CTL Cube,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.750
CTL get salaries.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.990
Okay.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.570
Now what I'm going to do whenever we remove their deployment,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.250
it removes the parts as well.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.830
Cube CTL delete deployment under deployment.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.180
Name on the face.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.510
Either Deployment is not there.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.820
Whenever we delivered the deployment,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.350
it tells the parts as well.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.690
Now let's deliver the service as well.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:20.050
So cube CTL del it service followed by service name.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.900
Okay,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.850
there is a typo.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.390
Okay,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.950
We heard the litter service as well.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.790
Nothing is there now.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.500
Whenever I run my playbook,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.360
you should create their deployment.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.910
Then it should create the service.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.050
Let's go and do that one.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:58.110
Clear the screen unless to run our answerable playbook and Sibal playbook minus a hosts on

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.320
a followed by.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.970
Our deployment fell in our deployment file.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.550
We have specified that on which surgery Children,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.450
it is runs on one Leon Kubernetes master etc.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.350
Okay,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.720
it's executor successfully on If I see if I see cubes it,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.610
he'll get to deploy Yes.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.850
When deployment is there on the get parts.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.350
Okay,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.020
parts also God created next next to playbook is to create a service,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.760
same command and service.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.180
It is creating service years on DA.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.750
Now you face See the surgeries?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.630
Yes,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.280
it's created six seconds ago and we have hard quarter port number as yet 31,200.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.180
So it's exposed on the same port number only if I refresh it still like enable toe access

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.100
May application.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.290
That is how we can use answerable playbooks.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.930
Now what we want to do is instead off running this sensible playbooks manually.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.850
I will add this one into our Jenkins job so that Jenkins is going to initiate playbook on

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.380
the playbook.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.900
Sar initiated that deployment and service files way we are using answerable to do that when

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.030
we can't we eggs eagle to deployment and service files directly.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.050
And the Jenkins there were,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.050
But we should probably the authentication toe the cluster with the Jenkins.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.990
Moreover,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.800
if any prerequisites are necessary,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.300
it cannot ableto do that one.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.850
Nothing.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.820
But we should create a maze also.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.170
Right?

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.180
All right,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.600
That's all for this lecture in next lecture,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.520
we are going to see how can we created Jenkins?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.280
Job toe,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.260
do their deployment?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.580
Nothing.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.350
But we create only Serie job.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.610
Thanks for watching this video under.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.850
See you in the next video.
