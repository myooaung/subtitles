00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hello,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.440
folks.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.150
Welcome back.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.430
In last video,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.690
we could see ants.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.860
Well,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.120
we're trying to create a new container on the new images and it failed to overcome this

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.550
problem.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.850
You should remove you were running container really available images from answerable system

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.600
to create new Amazing the new container.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.370
For that,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.460
we should modify our playbook little bit.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.350
Let's jump into over answerable system under do that.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.550
This is my answerable server.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.980
I am under slash will Pity Docker.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.020
We have your file called a simple develops project.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.430
Where did this added?

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.250
New task?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:51.690
That his name Stop current learning Do not So we're stopping current Romney in Container

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.070
Command Docker,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.740
stop the container.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.650
Name is simple Develops container.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.350
Next we need to remove it.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.550
How do you move?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.880
Stop with container Comment,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.910
dawg.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.390
Gotta autumn and counting Next of the move,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:31.650
Dr M is command Dr Autumn My earned amazement.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.600
So by adding this one what will happen whenever it is trying to deploy new where file

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.210
trusted to remove the world containers nothing but world worship and it creates the new

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.150
Washington to deploy stony worship.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.610
This is how you cannot just issue But again the problem with this one is if sometimes if

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.520
you don't find the docker container,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.610
it is going to fail over here.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.550
To address that problem,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.650
we need to add one more.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.650
Ask that is ignored.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.180
Ignore errors.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.750
Yes.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.980
So in case if the container is not available,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.040
are is in already stopping state,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.910
it is going to ignore the set up.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.870
Similarly,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.010
we need to do for remaining true tasks.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:32.700
That is really so that it is going to ignore in case amaze or container is not available.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.870
I help modified my playbook.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.350
According Toa my Nude.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.300
Let's exit Go to this turn our Jenkins job.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.670
We should able to see our new deployment.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.380
Still,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.250
we are older deployment.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.350
Let's go and execute it.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.640
Build a no because all the record is modified on the last time it's failed.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.560
This time that should not because we are handling the errors.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.980
Whatever is going to happen.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.180
It's tried to remove the container.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.290
If container exists,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.510
fostered stops the country not Then remove the container.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.050
Then remove the Emmys.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.530
Yes,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.860
this term it is successful on the refresh My container.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.850
You can see the play on your container.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.500
Is it working?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.400
Alright If we go and see In our answerable system,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.860
we could able to see the latest images on the containers.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.850
Docker,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.650
you may just You can see it is created under 21 seconds ago.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.970

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.150
Manus here even Container created 33 seconds ago.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.200
This is how we can able to create our docker containers seamlessly.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.850
Now to test more.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.040
I'm going to change the court this time.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.250
I don't touch anything.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.750
So deploying on container,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:24.620
using danceable get out of the dark get comet Same commit.

Intolerant by plane from the core Push to to create a docker container.
