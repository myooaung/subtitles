00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Hello,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.880
friends.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.850
Welcome back.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.860
If you are practicing,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.030
oversee a series set up on the first thing,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.950
few problems.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.750
Yes,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.060
you can watch this video.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.550
Otherwise you can skip it.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.850
I have seen that few people are getting confused while creating oversee a Serie pie plan.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.950
So they ask her a few questions in the questions and answer station.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.200
I have taken some of the questions which commonly asked and preparing this video so it

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.320
would be helpful for you toe understand where you were doing mistake and continue with our

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.750
lab without any problem.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.480
The quite commonly Oscar question is students are unable to push their docker image under

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.030
Dr Hub for this problem.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.380
The reason is you are running your playbook as a root user,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.550
but on target system,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.420
you haven't logged into darker Hub as a road user to overcome this problem.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.200
What you can do is either you can remove the become through in the playbook.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.830
Under try to execute it,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.500
it should work another vase.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.050
Run Docker Le Guin Comment as the root user under manager resistant.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.670
If you do this one,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.540
you will log in tow.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.920
Doctor.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.190
How busy Route user.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.450
So if you run your playbook as their route on the target system.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.350
It doesn't throw you another.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350
This is one off the problem.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.150
Other commonly asked.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.950
Her question is about missing pseudo password.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.500
This is because you haven't added you're in a segment user.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.350
Two suitors file to run the playbook as the root user on the target system.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.970
What we should do for that one we should are the A NUS admin user Two suitors well under

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.010
manager system.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.670
So it's classy.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.150
DeSisto doors file by using v a pseudo on the are the sentry.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.180
That is how you can fix this problem.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.610
Apart from this,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.680
I also suggest you that toe a few other things Keep in mind those are make sure slash were

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.330
pretty darker.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.010
Directory is wounded by Airness Admin User If it is not wound,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.820
you cannot ableto copy there that Philando target system enable password based not

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.210
indication practice as it is until you feel comfortable to this project because if you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.230
change something,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.250
it miller to some other problem which you cannot be clear them to fight.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.520

because someone might ask the same question earlier and we answered.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.950
It sells a lot off over time.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.940
Don't push.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.050
