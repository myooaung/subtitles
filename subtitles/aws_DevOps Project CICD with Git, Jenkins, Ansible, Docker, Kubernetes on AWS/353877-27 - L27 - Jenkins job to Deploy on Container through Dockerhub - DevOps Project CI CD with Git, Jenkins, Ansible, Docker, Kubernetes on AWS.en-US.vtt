00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
Hello,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.510
folks.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.640
Welcome back In previous lecture,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.850
we helped create it to answerable playbooks.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.170
One answerable playbook is going to create a darker images on push.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.540
The team isn't or doctor her.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.830
Another one is toe pull The darker inmates and created container wrote off it In this video

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.830
,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.670
I'm going to show you how we can limit creating image only unanswerable system under to

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.250
play it only under target environment.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.730
Once it is destroyed,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.150
we are going to modify over Jenkins jobs to automate all this process.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.380
We thought wasting our panel.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.250
It's jumping to over answerable server.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.500
I am on my answerable server currently underway or pretty Doctor,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.550
If I really start,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.920
I hope you may start with a mill on the project without women on Diehard logged in as a in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.690
a sudden because we want to execute playbooks as a NSAID mean on that there was a typo in

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.650
our playbooks.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.670
If you are using same playbook,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.630
please updated.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.890
It should be true.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.390
There was a typo over here under.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.950
Let's try to understand this playbook one more time.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.080
You may start.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.390
William l is going toe created images with our latest careful then target as away and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.550
killed so that we can ableto push it into over where?

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.980
Ankles,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.420
Doctor,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.510
help repository.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.380
Then push this one toe darker,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.640
huh?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.150
Removed from the local server.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.650
Next playbook is project to dot William Ill.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.870
And if you see this playbook,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.600
this playbook is going to stop the container,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.030
then remove the container Didn't remove the doctor inmates which used to create a world

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.650
container.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.150
And this won't get executor because it is common to wrote.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.630
Next it pulls the latest image which was created by the previous playbook Didn't created

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.850
Container wrote off it.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.460
Okay,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.550
Before executing these playbooks,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.650
I will just to show you the doctor home.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.320
So this is over,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.850
Doctor,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.760
If you see our darker help that are 48 comments so far on our doctor Hope on the last image

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.450
was abated eight minutes single.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.750
Now I'm going to run our answerable playbooks.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.220
He may start William L.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.810
Playbook,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.400
but we want to create images on answerable system to limit our answerable playbook To

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.550
execute only and specific system.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.110
We can use their option called the limit.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.650
While executing our answerable playbook.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.440
Let's execute our answerable playbook toe,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.290
create a maze on our answerable system on.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.420
Push that into a doctor,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.670
huh?

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.630
Two executive danceable playbook and simple playbook minus side.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.340
Okay,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.860
let me show you the hosts.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.150
Well,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.430
here we have to solve what's in our hosts.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.750
Well,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.850
I want to limit to execute only on the local host on also alerts.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.980
Lee,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.550
start over.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.650
Dockery muses,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.570
we have,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.150
um It's called the time Kurt.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.310
Let's remove this one.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.830
Okay?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.110
No,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.150
you made us out of there.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.140
Flat.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.490
Sexy.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.700
Good.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.900
Over.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.350
Answerable playbook and symbol playbook minus a hosts on the playbook.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.870
Name minus,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.750
minus limit.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.960
I'm limiting this playbook to execute only on local host.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.890
Local host.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.220
Nothing,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.520
Bert.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.150
Our answerable server.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.100
So it creates a maze over here on the push.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.970
That image in tow,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.390
Doctor,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.640
Huh?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.250
On the removed from the local system,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.550
We'll wait until this playbook get executor.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.600
Okay?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.000
It makes has been created and updated their tax on pushing the emissions or darker,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.240
huh?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.120
On the removed from the local system.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.850
And if received docker images here,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.960
you cannot see your simple develops project in maize because it pushed on the removed on

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.240
the only you can see Tom.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.530
Jack,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.020
This is the base ways for our dream is.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.750
And if I goto darker Hub under refresh it instead of 48 it should go as a 49.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.850
I learned a few seconds ago it has been updated.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.950
All right.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.120
This is how we can limit our answerable playbook to exhibit only on specific system.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.910
Similar.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.650
Where I want to create a container by using the same is on target environment.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.790
In our case,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.650
our target environment is our doctor host.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.950
So let's see Docker images,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.460
Some images are there darker.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.650
PS man is here.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.410
The container is running.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.400
I will remove this container.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.040
Dr.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.550
Stop.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.950
Contain already then,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:07.750
Doc Keraterm contain already darker are made to remove him is so I'm removing this image.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.250
All right,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.500
Docker,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.550
PS menace here Nothing is there.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.040
Dr.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.850
He made this.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.550
No,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.410
you mazes under.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.450
Let's try to access our application from the browser.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.650
It won't work right now because container is not available.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.570
Let's execute our answerable playbook toe.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.750
Create a container on the target system.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.620
Let me clear the screen.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:47.500
Unless Onda and simply playbooks minus a hosts earned our playbook followed by targets are

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.610
over a beer to us.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.480
We have updated Desai Pediatrician,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.280
Our hosts.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.600
Well,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.050
so something I'm using that's executed.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.750
Founded this time.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.030
If we see no,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.150
he means is it should get your new images over here.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.450
We'll see.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.250
Okay.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.150
I think this time it will be available.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.420
Yep.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.380
New images there on the new container.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.730
Also,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.450
Creator,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.730
just our application is working.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.010
No,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.350
because our Camden Aires available.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.910
All right,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.650
This is how we can restrict our answerable playbooks to exude only on specific systems.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.450
But I have around this playbooks manually.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.690
In next video,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.010
I will update our Jenkins job toe.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.870
Execute this playbooks by using the Jenkins job itself to automate our enter.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.110
See a CD pipeline.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.170
All right.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.850
I will see you in the next video.
