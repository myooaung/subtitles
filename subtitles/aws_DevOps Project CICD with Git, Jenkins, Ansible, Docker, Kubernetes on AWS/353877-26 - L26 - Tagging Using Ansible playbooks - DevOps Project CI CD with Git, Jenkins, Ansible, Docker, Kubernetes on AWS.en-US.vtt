00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
Hello folks will come back so for this environment is ready,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.240
but we need appropriate answerable.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.890
Playbook's too pushy animales aren't or docker hub on the air deployment Answerable

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.100
playbook to create your docker container on target system For that,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.440
when we needed to answerable playbooks,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.420
one playbook will run only unanswerable toe.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420
Create image and push it in tow.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.820
Docker Hub Another answerable playbook will run on all that are good systems so that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.400
whenever we run that play book and we'll get able to initiate the docker pull command on

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.900
that target system on also docker Container Creation.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.400
So let's jump into answerable server and create those playbooks I am on.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.710
My hands will serve it here we have your playbook called Simple Develops Project or that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.830
women let's create a new playbook toe,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.260
create your teammates and push it into a doctor.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.520
Help so v a create simple the warps image Dr.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.180
William Men simple develops He made that way A melt is the answerable playbook name So

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:22.050
starts with the three minuses minus hosts All become become true mosques.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.580
Next name unanswerable system.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:41.110
We need to create your documents so create docker image using where file so Carmen Comb

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.100
earned Doctor Bill.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.250
My honesty simple.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.550
There were ups Image.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.520
Andi,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.310
I'm giving tag as the latest.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.100
It's ah,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.850
best practice to use Tag Dr.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520
Next dark.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.870
Nothing.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.250
Bert.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.710
In which folder do we have?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.060
Dr.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.350
Fred.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.180
So see here to the air,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.890
Change the directly slash war.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.550
PT Dr Right?

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.350
No.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.910
And Mr this index minus name Double Spacey's.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.010
So this is the Syntex.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:38.060
No next task is to create the attack to push on to Dr Hub Further Creator Goto he made so

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.150
to create your dad,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.190
we should use a doctor tag.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.270
You're amazing.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.150
Him followed by our accord is way and killed.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.150
Earned him is usually you can use the variables over here rather than hard According you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.840
Were you Israeli,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.090
Ari?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.720
Majorly,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.170
where we can use answerable variables Next next year's we need to push this image onto

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:18.310
Docker Hope so Push the image on toward Dr Hub Card Man Docker push When kids simple

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:27.420
develops you made right So one seem is is pushed Toronto Dr.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.150
Hope we need to remove it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.820
We need to remove from aranzabal system so that again whenever we are running playbook next

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.130
time it won't Troy and the other that amazes already exist.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:54.370
So remove darker majors from answerable servant command Dougherty out of my amazing him.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.740
First,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:04.190
we created a maze name with the latest and also we helped created one more emails with that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.190
.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.650
That is where Kill slash image.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.040
Right on the latest.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.150
You can you even for these as well?

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.290
Sometimes he majors may not be available in those cases.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.040
We need to ignore the error.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.010
Ignore They rose.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.910
Yes.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.290
So that's on.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.360
Let's save it under try to execute this playbook and we'll see what will happen because we

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.650
have all the information over here.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:43.080
So let me execute and symbol Playbook Mina si host file in host fell.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.550
We have only local host,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.650
so it runs on local host and we'll see.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.250
So pushing em isn't.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.690
Or Doctor,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.940
huh?

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.950
Maybe.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.650
Sometimes we need to authenticate.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.400
Remove Dockery Maze.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.660
Oh,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.590
it's ignored.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.720
Seems to some issue,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.250
is there?

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.700
Let me start with Dockery mazes.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.250
It is not to be moving.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.800
Maybe a container is running out off it.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.580
Yes,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.720
your container is running,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.050
so we should stop this container before removing it.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.060
That's okay.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.050
Let me remove it.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.040
Dougherty,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.170
Automatic forceful m removing because it's running.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.450
No.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.250
Now let's clear the screen.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.490
I'm going to read in the hands Bill Playbook again.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.740
Better before returning.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.550
Let's see the hosts fell.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.700
So we have only local host.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.590
That is what I want.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.850
Trento show you no answerable playbook minus a host.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.310
I learned where Mel File.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.880
So it is trying to push emissions,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.340
or Doctor,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.610
Huh?

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.040
OK,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.950
everything is fine,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.680
Dr.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.360
Images.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.470
We don't find any majors over here,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.830
Tom.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.700
Care today is the base Mr spent.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.850
And if I switch back toe our doctor hub,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.070
if I refresh it again,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.750
you can see.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.830
And new image has been pushed A few seconds ago.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.360
Yes.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.650
On fighting's we helped push the so far.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.360
That is how we can able to push.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.330
The image isn't over,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.690
Doctor.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.240
Help display book is ready.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.530
So this playbook,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.950
what exactly does it to do?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.840
It takes the careful are the creator,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.520
Dr Mate with the doctor failed.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.860
Attack that image,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.600
push it into darker hub on removing the local system.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.520
So that again,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.050
if we reading it is not going to throw any other.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.470
Another thing is we need to run under target systems.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.650
Another playbook.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.800
So I will modify existing playbook which we created in previous lectures.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.750
So more simple develops project where Milito create.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.370
So I'm giving better naming convention,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.910
create simple develops project we have Mel.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.520
All right,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.980
no will air it It to be a create simple develops project to dart away a mint in this case

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.040
what we should do So 1st 1 is stopping the content areas in the target system.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.790
If there is any container is running with the simple develops container stop it then I

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.500
remove it.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.170
Then remove the doctor images If you have your doctor's name is name with simple develops

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.680
maze But it should pull from the public repository So in the public repository it will

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:51.230
comes with account name slash emission So here it should be way and killed slash simple

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:57.650
there works him is under colon latest because we're pulling the Lotus team is similar.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:06.280
Where now we don't build our court here because amazes already built and available for you

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:06.950
will use.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.850
So we just need toe pull the mates.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:21.370
So I'm going to create a new task for this Pull doctor image Poor Docker image from doctor

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:21.370
,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:21.640
Huh?

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.970
No command is darker.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.780
Pull Dr Remains Name is this one.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.940
So it is going toe.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.870
Pull the maze.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.560
Once it pulls the maze,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.150
it should create a container.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:45.110
So Cardenas unit to change Though you were in his name as well When kills and aren't the

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.130
end I noticed.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:47.650
Okay,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.550
so I can say this is also fine.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.990
No,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.310
let me execute this as well.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.150
On over answerable system itself.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:05.650
Answerable danceable playbook minus I hosts and running on answerable system itself.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:11.650
They should ableto remove any containers are there in our local system.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:17.850
Onda created new pull the new image and created container darker images.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:25.520
It pulls the maze and doc could PS minus a It should created containers.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:25.690
Well,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.190
yes,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.150
it's working as expected.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.280
No,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.790
we need to modify.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.000
What?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.430
Jenkins job toe exude display books.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.180
Before that,

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.480
we should add our target systems on our hosts.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:39.750
Well,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:46.860
so over Target system is Doctor Hope Dr.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.360
Host,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.830
Our target system is darker.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:55.650
Host I'm taking the I P address off this one on Harding It Do you okay?

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:01.130
That's all for this video in next week I'm going to show you How can we modify our Jenkins

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.550
job next duties
