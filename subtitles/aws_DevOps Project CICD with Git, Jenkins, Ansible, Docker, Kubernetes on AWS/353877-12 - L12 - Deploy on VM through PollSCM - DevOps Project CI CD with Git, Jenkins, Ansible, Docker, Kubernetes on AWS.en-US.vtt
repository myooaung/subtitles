00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
Hello.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.410
Folks will come back in this video.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.410
I'm going to show you how we can ableto billy a job.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.150
Whenever there is new change in the court to experiment this one,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm going to use our existing job.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.050
It's help.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.820
That is the play on Tomcat server.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.050
Let's open it.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.190
I'm mortifying the existing configuration here.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.750
If he scrawled on a little bit,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070
you can see building triggers under build it regards.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.460
We have multiple options.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.750
Currently we are building by executing the bill job.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.440
Apart from this,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.650
we can build a jobs by triggering remotely building after other projects are built.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.890
Build periodically under build periodical.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.580
You need to specific run job so that the job get executes.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.280
Are that particular period after next to get her book on policy?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.450
Um,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.520
I'm talking about the option called Police IAM under Pulis him also we should provide the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.220
cruncher in policy.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.470
Um,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.710
according to crown job,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.100
it will go and fetch the information off your repository.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.250
In our case of repositories Hello world.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.920
So are that particular period of time.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.280
If there is any changes in the repository,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.110
it is going toe build that job.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.570
If it didn't find any changes.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.250
It wanted to go to that job.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.050
So let's go do it.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.930
I'm giving all starts.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.850
Nothing Bird.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.460
Every minute,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.290
every hour,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.210
every day,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.350
every month and every week it should get exude.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.290
If you want to execute one senior day,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.530
you can specify that.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.080
Okay.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.040
Are on the 12 0 clock every day.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.870
Want to execute?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.920
This is how you can different the crunch up.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.040
But we want to see how policy um does it work?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.090
So we are going to specify all stars Nothing but every minute.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.570
The job should get eggs screwed.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.320
A play you can see here.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.250
It is also saying that it gets executive every minute.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.440
Yes,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.410
I knew toe executed every minute I have saved.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.820
It seems there is a change in the court.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.550
That's why this job is triggered anyway.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.250
Let it run.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.500
And if you go on the refresh your job I don't think so.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.820
You can see any change because this is first time.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.730
That's what it is executing now what I will do,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.020
I will pull this court and do some modifications again.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.980
Push it back toe,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.330
get help Then whenever it finds changes,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.150
it should rebuild our court.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
Let's go on to do that one.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.400
This is my Jenkin server.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.380
I have already cloned our get hub repository.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.950
If you want to do this one you can do get clone and followed by Get hub Repository World.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.100
You can get that from the world.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.410
Get her select a clone under down Lord.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.040
There you can find a link.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.010
Copy that link underpowered here so that it get close.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.450
But I have already cloned it,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.540
so I canceled it.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.600
If you want to get latest cord into your system,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.480
get so that it pulls the latest court,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.650
it may be anything it's not.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.400
It doesn't mean that you should pull into Jenkins that were wherever we want Omar defray.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.280
You can do my knees a window slept up so that I can not ableto don't let it locally.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.500
I'm using Jenkins or as a development system.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.250
For time being,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.290
we are going toe Marty for your filed called index Dark tsp.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.770
That is available Underwear bear source.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.170
Main rebel up under this location,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.010
we have your file called Index started.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.240
Jsp whatever content you are so this file it displaced in the browser.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.450
Even you can see the same content is available here.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.650
Now let's Marty for yet v a indexed or two jsp.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:04.500
I'm adding hitched to nothing but herder toe deploying on you,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.820
Veum.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.680
So we are deploying it on William on the close,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.490
it get status.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.480
We help Marty for your file.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.650
So good status tells you that if there is any changes in the court,

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.650
get come it minus him.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.370
Maar deferred index dot jsp so I'm adding it to local repository.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.120
So come into usually are see what changes to local repository.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.120
Then we need to push it into remote repository.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.150
So sorry.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.510
First we should add it.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.350
Get ad,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.270
then get commit.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.950
We should do.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.650
And if you see here,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.790
if we see an over to get hurt,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.950
I'm just a refreshing it.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.440
So far,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.730
we have eight commits.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.750
Once we push the other court,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.960
it should get updated to nine toe.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.740
Push it into get hub repository.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.040
We should do get push.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.250
Howdy,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.170
John Master.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.950
Okay,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.920
so it is going to push our court master branch.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.560
Okay,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.150
It's done.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.550
Now it placed Get status.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.920
There is no changes.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.400
Whatever changes we have done,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.920
we pushed into Master Branch on good herb repository.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.080
So no ninth commit.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.650
It came.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.900
And if I open the file,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.770
you have bet reverb and extract jsp It has modified.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.680
So far,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.400
we haven't done any modifications.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.420
So lost job exuded at 12.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.200
56.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.370
Now we a new build is going to trigger right now because we have modified our court.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.390
It waits for the next minute.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.230
Andi exuded.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.660
Yep.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.310
You can see here it's trigger your new build because it found change in our court will wait

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:06.000
until it gets completely No.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.970
Let's go back to over Tomcat server.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.770
Let me see.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.110
Will go inside toe or pity Tom Kitt Rebel.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.550
Let me become your route,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.460
Seeley to over,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.440
perhaps directly.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.850
You're less Manus Ltro,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.910
if you see here did it.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.970
Yep.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.150
Latest careful has been deployed on Defy God and refresh our peace.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.750
This job is successful on the refresh our pace.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.070
Yep.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.550
You can see whatever changes we have done.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.010
It has been appearing here.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.450
This is how we can Arto made our job toe execute whenever there is change in the court.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.010
So far,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.790
I can say that I have set up continuous integration and continues delivery on our system.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.040
But in this case we are using.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.750
Jenkins has a billed as well as deployment.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.300
It'll way because it is going toe.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.650
Build the court as well as deploying by using deploy toe container.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.320
Hope you understand how the automated build happens there cell for this section in next

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.950
section We are going to talk about how to deploy any docker container.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.140
Thanks for watching this video,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.550
