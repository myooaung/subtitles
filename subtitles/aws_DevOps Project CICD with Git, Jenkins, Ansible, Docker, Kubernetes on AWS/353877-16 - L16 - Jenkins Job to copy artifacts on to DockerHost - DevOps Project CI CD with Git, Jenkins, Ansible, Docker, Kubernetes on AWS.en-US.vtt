00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
Hello,

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:00.950
folks.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.440
In last video,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.590
we helped set up our doctor on the Jenkins Communication.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.230
It was working fine in this video,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.030
I'm going to create a new job to copy over Artifact under Dr Host.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.140
Once it is available in Docker host,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.650
it is easy to copy artifact onto Docker container.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.660
With that,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.850
I'm going to create a new Jenkins job.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:32.070
Go to new weight on deploy on Dr instead of choosing Mavin.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.320
What?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.830
I will do it.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.150
I'm going to copy all the conflagrations from previous job.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
So it's like a copy off our previous job.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.650
But I'm going to change according to a darker deployment.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.020
Get her be same Pulis him.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.050
I don't need for this job building same and we are not going to deploy any William.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.950
So I'm removing it on the possible accents we should choose.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.740
Send the build artifacts.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.590
So our institute So it is going to send the art effects Tow targets are were through a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.990
search here we How can figure the only one server that is doctor hosted.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.840
That's where it's get populated.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.930
If you have more servers,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.960
you can see under drop down list now.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.550
Source file So where exactly our file does located?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.180
Usually the file get creates under workspace.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.160
It creates your folder called a Targets under target.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.410
You can see the bear file If you need more information,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.810
you can click on question more.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.430
It gives the details what it is expecting.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.650
We should get the part off the air fell.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.850
Where does it located?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.510
Let's jump into over Jenkin Server to get that I'm on my Jenkin server on the Peter Beauty

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.510
.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.980
I'm in third workspace.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.450
If you do a list,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.480
I'm going toe check in the previous job where the artifact is available in the same

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.990
location.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.140
It will be created in the new job is well with the job.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.120
Name one folder.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.670
Get creates under that we have a bear Then target here we have therefore So the part would

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.100
be after we were job name water.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.580
What is there?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.310
That is the part.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:24.990
So this is the part Rebel slash Target on Started out where you can give barrels.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.320
You can do the full name off.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.650
You were aware Fell next to remove prefix.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.560
Well,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.270
it is copying.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.390
It copies the directory structure as well.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.710
If you don't need this directory structure.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.670
You can remove it,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.770
but let it be like this for now.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.140
I'm going to remove in next to build in remote directly.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.880
Where do you want to copy by defaulted copies?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.770
The artifact Until users home directly In our case,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.980
our user is doctor.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.710
Admit it.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.560
Copies artifact under Dr Admin Home Directory.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.120
So I'm just giving dart so that in the current directory it is going to copy execute

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.610
comments.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.140
If you want to exclude any comments on remote host,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.550
you can space way over here.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.630
But right now I'm I don't want to execute any comments over there.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.050
So just up Play.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.350
Save it before building this job.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.550
Lets jumping Tober Doctor server and see what is there in the dark Rodman Home Directory.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.360
This is over,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.160
Dr Erdmann.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.260
I'm already in Dhaka.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.810
Rodman home.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.660
They're clean stuff.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.300
That one.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.360
Let's Moto Doctor.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.920
I mean Peter bloody who we are My I'm your doctor Rodman and I'm inside the my home

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.410
directly.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.450
Let's build the job.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:54.750
Build it so it's building job.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:06.330
Alright,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.000
buildings successful after building it straight to connect toe our doctor host.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.450
Yes,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.480
it's connected.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.980
Under transferred one file.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.650
Good.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.780
Everything looks good.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.000
Let me do a less.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.280
Yes,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.430
you can see So Siri,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.750
repair up target.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.950
They're less.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.130
If you see yet,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.350
we're file is there?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.020
So it's copied successfully.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.450
Now if you don't need Web app,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.900
slash Target,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.420
you need to modify What job?

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.050
A little bit.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.050
Go back to your job,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.620
Marty.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.160
Free configure Onda,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.140
remove prefix.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.690
I'm going to give you a bad It's class star.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.050
Good.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.630
So it is going to remove this directly.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.420
Stretcher Well,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.790
copying under target system Hopley.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.150
See before building it.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.050
Let's remove odor.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:10.050
Existing artifact Syria tilled goingto home directory.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.720
You're less autumn.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.350
An asado lived up,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.430
so nothing is dead.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.250
Let's build the job.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:26.120
Okay,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.490
Building successful again.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.610
Now let's toe unless Yes,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.450
you can see this turned bar file has been copied directly under our home directory.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.850
This is how you can transfer river files to target systems by using Jenkins.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.230
All right,

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.440
now we want toe.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.230
Copy this artifact onto our docker container,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.530
which we are going to create newly for that purpose.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.770
We need to rate your doctor friend In next video,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.800
I will show you hope to radio Dr File
