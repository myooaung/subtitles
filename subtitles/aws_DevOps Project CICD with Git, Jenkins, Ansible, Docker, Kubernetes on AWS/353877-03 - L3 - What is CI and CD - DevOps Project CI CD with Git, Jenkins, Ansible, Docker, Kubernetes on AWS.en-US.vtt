00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
Hello,

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.460
folks,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.510
Welcome back in this video I'm going to talk about what is continues.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.790
Integration continues Delivery under continues deployment.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.390
This team is goose and overview off continuous integration delivery Under deployment in

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.640
continuous integration,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.250
Dollop was pushed their court onto source code management system.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.600
In our case,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.630
it is getting one score is available in the source code management system.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.940
They were ch teau.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.640
Could ableto agent play and pull the court out of medically are UN build under Unity's Here

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.550
we are using Jenkins as our ch teau are the end off successful continuous integration

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.980
process.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.620
We could able to get an artifact deploying this artifact on your target in government

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.910
Nothing but stays ing.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.470
We called as it continues delivering in the continuous delivery process.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.860
Artifact which was generated in the continuous integration process,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.090
get deployed automatically under next available environment in the staging environment

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.180
performance distinct and functional testings happen once it is looks fine.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.910
It gets a deployed onto production environment with the manual intervention,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.150
whereas in the continous deployment,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.750
once it is successfully tested on the stressing environment,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.390
it automatically gator de place into the production environment without any manual

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.150
intervention.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.860
The difference between the continues delivery into deployment is there is a man will

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.050
intervention to deploy onto next to available involvement,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.220
whereas in continues deployment,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.850
it is also automated.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.090
If we can me the same thing toe our environment which we are going to set up didn't until

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.390
the stairs were artifact that generates it comes under two continues integration.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.390
Nothing but court Get pulled from get on build Arctic Jenkins.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.920
In this days we get young artifact No,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.450
in continues delivery artifact to get to deployed onto target environment.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.070
So this week all does it continues delivery.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.480
Now this enter process happens Harto medically.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.400
Then we called.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.080
That continues deployment.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.470
I hope this has given an ideal What is C and the city?

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.870
With that,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.070
we are going to start set up to see a serie pipeline from next video Until then.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.480
Bye.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.250
See you there.
