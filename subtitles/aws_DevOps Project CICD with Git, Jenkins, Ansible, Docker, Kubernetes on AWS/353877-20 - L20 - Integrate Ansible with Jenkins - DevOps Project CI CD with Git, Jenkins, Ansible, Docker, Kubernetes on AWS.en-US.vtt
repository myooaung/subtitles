00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
Hello,

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.350
folks.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome back in last video,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.200
we have seen how to set up answerable environment in this video.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.620
I'm going to show you How can we integrate and splitter Jenkins for that to jump into our

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.750
Jenkins council?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.760
So this is my Jenkins console.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.500
If you remember,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.060
our last job was failed.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.520
Because whenever we are trying to create a docker container,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.170
it was saying that already Container is working Torkham,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.040
those kind of problems we are going to use and simple as our deployment total.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.480
So in that process,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.350
we should integrate danceable with Jenkins.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.730
If you remember,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.950
we have enabled LeSage connections between Jenkins under darker host.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.180
Same thing we should do for answerable as well.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.150
For that Go to manage Jenkins.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
Confident system.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.050
And if you scroll down,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.760
there is the option called publisher of racist shit.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.000
If you remember,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.350
we have.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.250
Are the doctor host similar way?

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.560
We need to add one more.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.250
That is associate servers so that the Jenkins can associate toe answerable system under

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100
copied o of our friend.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.150
Here s his hit,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.760
sir would name I'm naming it.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.460
Does there Answerable server,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.850
host name.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.220
Let me get die,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.750
Pierre Joseph answerable system.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.920
This is of aranzabal system.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.950
Clear the screen,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.050
increase the front Saiz.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.010
I peered through the yard.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.280
Good day,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.580
period.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:44.750
That's a fanciful system user name in a sudden on DA advanced use password authentication

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.320
under password authentication in this admin user password.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.980
You should Probert under test the connection connection is success because we have enabled

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.750
the password authentication.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.150
Our place said That's it.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.940
Now what we need to do is we need to create new Jenkins job that Jenkins job in every Ron

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.950
Jenkins can able to copy artifacts on target environment.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.250
So let's do that one.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.530
Create new item.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.680
I I helped created the A document for this job.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.510
Even our previous jobs also helped created documentation.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.900
So you can refer to those documents if you have any issues,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.620
those are available under simple there works project.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.150
We have Jenkins jobs.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.260
So he really stop the jobs.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.720
Whatever.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.990
We are using those jobs as well s docker file son.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.200
Danceable mammal pelts are available,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.850
which we are going to use from now.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.270
So I will continue to update this folder so that you can get all the jobs information.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.860
So we are going toe do deploy on container using answerable.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.280
This is the one we are doing.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.150
You can follow this document even to set it up.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.950
Okay.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.070
So far,

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.430
No,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.230
let me name it.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:11.390
Does he deploy on container using answerable on the copy it from deploy on container.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.790
Okay.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.510
This is our last job from here.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.070
I'm going to copy all the definitions.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.550
Okay,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:26.810
that is type O deploy on container using danceable repository.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.500
We don't change nothing to change here.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.620
Build also fine.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.390
Here.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.130
We need to change answerable server instead of darker host so that verify it also seem

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.830
target.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:40.970
Sorry.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.080
Removed prefixes.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.050
Same under remoter directory.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.050
This time,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.360
instead of fusing home radically off user,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.300
I will create a separate to directly.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.200
And we'll use that to their careers over workspace.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.250
So let's goto aranzabal system created directory under war Pity Serie slash or pity.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.550
So it'll I m cured a year,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.660
Dr.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.870
On creating your directly colder darker.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.730
Next thing is I'm going Tokyo full access to inside men on this darker directory for that

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.050
Sodo see her chew on changed the ownership too.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.090
Yeah,

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.050
in a submarine in this had meant on slash will pity Dr.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.540
Because whenever we use pseudo It creates as a root user.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.150
No,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.270
the list man,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.820
a cell slash will pity You can see Docker directories there and it's warned away in a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.270
segment so that if we are copying something from the Jenkins,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.480
it doesn't give permission issues so going,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.850
Saito Docker Nothing is dead.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.050
So we are going to use this directory to store our artifact.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.590
So instead,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.970
off dart I'm going to use slash were pretty docker But here it wont to take special

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.200
characters so you should probably double slash next.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.150
We are not going to execute anything right now.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.860
We'll continue to march for this job for time being just well tested this job whether it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.250
can able to copy artifact santo answerable system are not Let's build the job.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.100
Once buildings successful,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.950
we could able to see the way our fell over here.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.950
So for nothing is there let's wait until build is completed.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:37.660
Okay?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.830
Its success I'm goingto do were less menacing.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.320
Yes,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.710
we're fairly Is there all right?

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.720
It's working as expected Now we should create your doctor remains which could contain this

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.670
rebel doctor where file as well to create that when we should have your doctor fell You

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.270
next to do?

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.270
I'm going to show you.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.260
How can we do that?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.460
One until then?

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.780
Bye.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.450
See you there.
