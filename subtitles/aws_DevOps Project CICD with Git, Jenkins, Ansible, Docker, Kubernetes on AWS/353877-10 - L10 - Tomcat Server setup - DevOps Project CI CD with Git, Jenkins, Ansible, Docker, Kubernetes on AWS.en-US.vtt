00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
Hello,

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.460
folks.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.480
Welcome back in this video I will show you how to set up Tomcat Server as they discussed in

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.700
the previous video we need your target in were meant to host.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.300
Over where?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.240
File for that we are setting up.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.250
Your tomcats are worth.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.290
I have objectively a document under our documents.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.650
Repository how to set up your tomcats are were Let's go there.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.670
This is about simple develops project.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.890
Here we have your folder called a Tomcat.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.850
Go inside toe this open Tom Kurt installation Fine.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.150
Here we have instructions how to install Tom Kitt.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.320
So it's quite simple.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.390
We need to set up your new easy to instance to install overtime kit.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.330
We can download it from the time get official website.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.500
Once it is downloaded,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.020
Go and say to Tomcat bin Directory to start to Tom,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.050
get services so that you can access the application from the browser.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.870
For your information,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.510
even Tomcat runs on port number Eijiro,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.120
eijiro,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.730
Howard,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.680
drink instruments.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.930
But in our case,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.590
this tour to different star wars.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.550
That's why it won't create any conflict.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.710
But if you are running both in a single system,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.740
then you must change the port numbers.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.920
We have other procedure over here.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.200
How to change port numbers in Tomcat server,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.330
you can follow the same procedure if you want to change.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.030
And the next thing is we should create users way because we are going to host over where

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.370
file under Tomcats or what?

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.890
So Tomcats are were has toe alot our Jenkins or what?

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.630
To authenticate to host of River fell for that purpose.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.350
We should create a couple of rules and a couple of users.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.650
I will show you how we can do that one.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.050
Let's go toe over AWS console creating user work to set up our Tom gets over.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.050
I'm jumping back toe mayor ablaze console just to to refresh refreshing the page.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.100
Okay,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.860
whatever I have dominated it.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.750
Car disappeared.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.760
Let's launch a new system even here also.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.450
I'm going with a mission the next 2018.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.720
Tito micro Nothing to change next and in bags.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.310
I'm giving name as it Tomcat server Security group will use the same secret group because

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.180
we have already will burn the port number Eijiro Eijiro What?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.150
They're next lunch.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.750
Lunch it.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.250
We will wait until it comes up.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.290
All right,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.900
Our surgeries in running state.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.150
Let's take the public AP off this system.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:43.250
Shish in This is church and the Lord over.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.950
Keep it,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.680
you user as easy to menace.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.350
User increase the fiancee's clear the screen pseudo to root.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.550
No,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.690
we need to donor Tom care packages toe Set it up over here.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.350
Go back to your counsel.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.430
This is Mavin.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.650
Let me close it.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.500
The perch it,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.990
Tom.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.850
Curto don't Lord years.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.870
Okay?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.470
The initial page itself will take us toe.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.800
Tom.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.600
Kurt eight.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.050
Software download pays.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.110
Okay,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.730
we help Tom get nine as well.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.980
But we go with Tom,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.560
get date through.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.080
Jenkins,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.200
we can deploy on Tom.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.330
Get eight server so you can see the washing off.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.610
Eight.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.940
Point fired out for three.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.630
Here.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.910
We can ableto don't lower tar dark desert.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.650
Copy the link address.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.800
I just copied it.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.550
Go back.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.210
Okay.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.760
This is our tomcats are work.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.920
Let me rename the host.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.220
Name was to name Tom Care.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.660
Okay,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.960
It's name does it?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.600
I'm get right.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.850
No.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.410
And I'm going toe inside War pity on w gate.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.440
However you world so don't Lord Tom Kitt all right?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.110
It has been downloaded extracted perm minus X regenerative so a couple of things.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.220
Nothing but on Japan.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.790
Dunder,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.850
we're doing with single common again for better naming convention.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.710
Let me rename it is it just took Tomcat.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.650
Unless going say to Tom Kurt,

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.650
we can see the contrail been filed.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.640
Okay,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.550
under bean nothing but of binary.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.680
You can see a lot of files here.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.570
You can see start up daughters hits shut down dot Is it started about a city is to start

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.750
Our tomcats are over.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.830
And sure don't Artis hits to stop or Tom Kitt.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.730
So I have started over Tom Care And also port number 80 injuries already enabled in our

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.050
security group So we could able to access this one from the browser eijiro a digital.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.940
That's it.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.930
It's quite simple.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.520
OK,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.750
we could able to access our tomcats that were from the browser,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.050
but let me try to log in until manager app.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.700
It is not allowing me to log in way because by default,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.080
ever tomcats are over follows from your local system toe address This issue we need to

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.390
update one off the configuration file called context Dr Acceptable.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:27.080
They only use that can able to log in tow our manager application from outside of Tomcat

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.580
server.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.850
So let's go and find this file.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.520
Find a slash minus name context.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.450
Doctor examined.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.860
You can see here.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.860
Three files are there,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.880
but we don't consider this one.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.750
We need to considerable files which are under rebel.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.350
Let me read it.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:54.820
Burn the Here you can see a line which starts with the value Class name.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.610
If you try to understand the entry off of value class name,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.890
it is allowing the I P address,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.560
which starts with 1 27 This is actually a Lubeck address.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.190
Our local host address.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.470
So nothing but it all those who only from the local system.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.070
But we want to access it from outside as well.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.750
So if we comment it out,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.230
it our lows from outsiders will go to insert more to edit this file.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.450
Toe comment Airline in Tom get it starts with less than escalate remark Manus Manus.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:33.950
And also and here with minus minus close.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.150
That's it.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.200
No,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.500
we need to do same thing on other file as well.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.650
Let's open it.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.250
Go here.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.960
Context,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.440
value,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.250
class name.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:54.450
So comments started comment in there.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.650
So the fund,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.990
if we Marty for you.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.130
Any conflagration in Tom get we must to restart Tom Guard Services.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.190
Stop it.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.780
Sure don't.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.350
Artists hitch then started talking.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.350
We have repressed over Tomcat services.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.010
No,

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.350
Let's reload this one.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.650
Okay,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.970
on the man.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.580
Is it up this time?

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.930
It is not throwing any error.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.150
It is asking for the user name and password,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.050
but I don't know any user name and password,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.750
So we should set up some of the users under rules to access it from the browser.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.850
For that,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.850
I have updated Lee,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.000
stop the users in our document just to use these.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.760
If you understand this one properly,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.190
we are adding some rules.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:46.310
Manager juei Nothing but to log in from the G way managed script tweaks Good Some scripts

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.310
Manager J makes like that.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.460
Two different rules are there on if you see a user called the Dip lawyer,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.580
he's a group off manager script.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.450
Nothing better to execute.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:03.750
Some of those groups are copy some friends from the server We New Year manager script rule

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.750
.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.980
So we are going to create a user called a deep lawyer with password Iplayer under part off

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.650
manager Scriptural Group.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.860
This user,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.450
we're going to use to copy were killed from the Jenkins at the same bill.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.300
We have your user called Tom Care.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.090
And with possible secret under part off manager Juei Group.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.510
This user is used to access it.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.810
Where?

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.050
Our Tomcat application from the browser.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.760
But it is just for testing purposes only.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.710
This user would be sufficient for us.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.750
Let me copy this one.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.570
And one more thing is we need to abduct this one under Tom.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.850
Care to users start XML under contradictory.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.170
So let's go back.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.170
Currently,

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.810
I'm under Bill directly One step back again.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.330
If I do.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.750
Peter bloody I'm under Tom Kurt folder here.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.650
You have yet contradictory.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:05.250
Did the file called Tom care to user Start xml goto end.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.050
You must our users under Tomcat.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.160
He was That's context.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.240
So all the lanes are commented out under Tomcat.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.920
You that so?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.450
I'm going to insert more here.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.720
Onda copy.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:27.820
You were use it so there may be a chance that sometimes some special characters make it

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.450
added because I have encountered this issue.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.160
So let me remove the spaces again.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.850
Under addict.
