00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
Hello,

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.080
friends.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.910
Welcome back to my last two hands on radio station.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.180
In this really?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.400
I'm going to show you how to set up communities under Deploy Ionic over nineties using

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.850
Jenkins unanswerable in your single video.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.930
It would be useful for you to refer once again once you completely were Course Don't do

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.290
this.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.230
I will go through it all our get hub researches which we use in our training so that we can

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.250
set it up quickly.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.860
As you have seen,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.750
I have explained how to set up kubernetes and deploy in kubernetes in our previous videos.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.980
In this lecture,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.640
I will just quickly run through with other all the steps I may not explain each and

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.060
everything.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.140
Clearly with that,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.250
let's jump into our get hub repository.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.520
So I'm on my get hub repository Simple develops project Here we have a kubernetes holder

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.730
under that we how Cooper natives set up Dart MD which is having steps to set up communities

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.590
in this case.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.250
First we should set up we and we've been too easy to instance I have already logged into my

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.800
ear oblivious management console.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.570
Let's go to ec2 But our new instances we don't have anything So I have stopped.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:20.000
Are lower develops in were mental Let's lunch and instruments It is Ruben toe Tito Micro

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.050
would be sufficient.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.770
Nothing to change here.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:36.870
Their GP would be fine Bag name kids management Sort of A Because we are managing our

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:47.710
communities using this select existing security group earned lunch Keep it develops project

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.710
Keep that I'm using We'll wait until it comes up I'm repression My console Yes,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:06.650
it's running their stake The I P address Open more baxam Fission This is Hitch I P address

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:24.390
followed Play our private key turn it is We're window system so user is open toe under look

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:34.050
to increase the font size No let's become your route Clear the screen So makes the strip

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:48.500
insoluble Eassey life for that Foster Stone Lord Wsc Laybourne Deal Now we should NGO a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.330
think on gyp is not there in Woburn to system So a deputy get our deputy install Sanjay

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:09.250
burned right on even fight on also we need Yes I want to install it Next Bungee pervert

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:24.150
Jarabulus here lay burned in next Install it So we have set up a rwc Really?

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.910
The aws minus minus Russian Yes,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.750
You just installed.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.020
Next we should install Cube CDL to install cubes.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.900
It'll faster download it then.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.580
Next to commander would be our execution.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.750
Permission toe this.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.550
You can just see that bank.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.490
Yes,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.310
this is the fun.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.950
There is no exhibition permission.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.950
So let's add it.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.150
Next thing we should move it into slash serious or local bill.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.850
That's it.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.120
No cube.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.140
CTL Yes.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.290
Cube City awash in 1.1 fe we have installed.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.080
But this is the latest watchin right.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.550
Next we should install cops.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.050
Cops is a tool which is useful to set up Kubernetes cluster on air.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.350
Oblivious Retorted this We cannot able to talk with our AWS management console.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.050
So we must need it.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.130
So once it is,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.330
don't already even we should have execution.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.330
Permission tothis Okay.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.450
Barrett execution permission.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.220
Okay.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.250
This is the one.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.860
No moment in tow,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.550
us or local being.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.060
It's done.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.040
We should create I am user our world with the road 53.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.550
Easy to I am under strict full access.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:20.380
Let's go to the AWS console services Are you roads?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.860
Because our boon to system also sitting in a terrible years so roles would be sufficient on

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.860
.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.080
We are attaching this role.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:40.910
Luisito next to add part of mission we need to add Is it off Lexus next?

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.770
Yes.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.950
Three full Lexus?

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.870
No,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.490
just about 53.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.550
Full access.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.610
Then I am for Alexis.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.950
Name,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:17.790
Community lives Roll cared strong kids of all And you can see here,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.210
you see,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.670
Two years three Road 53 a.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.460
M for Alexis.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.080
We have granted create year old once role is creator.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.640
We should attach this rolled over,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.020
you see two instance Let's go back to again On easy to instance console under here we hok

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:44.410
its management system actions No instant settings attach Replace Are you involved?

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.960
Okay,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.000
let's role play.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.250
That's it we have done Now.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.290
Now we need to tell toe this kubernetes management system to create service only on Mumbai

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.750
region.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.850
For that,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.940
we should right the AWS conficker.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.230
We don't have access Caylee in secret excess.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.290
Keep because it is a role on the default reason.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.140
Your piece?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.390
So one.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.710
This is Mumbai region Name on output.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.850
Let it be default.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.990
That's it.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:26.220
Now I will just execute you're abuses three or less just to make sure that our role is

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.630
working.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.950
Yes,

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.150
we can access history.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.430
And this is the bucket which is already exist.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.520
Little b.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.190
We are going to start our conflagration in this bucket.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.050
I will go and make it empty.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.920
So again,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.020
services Yes.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.450
Three in new tab Go to s three.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:58.590
I will just make it empty so that we don't have any data in this book.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.750
It come pump under it.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.150
Next,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.790
our teacher and I am build.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.040
Yes,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.650
it's done.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.640
Turned around.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.750
Conflagration No!

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.650
Create a road 53 Private Who's to juniors?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.780
Let's do that now again.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.650
Go to services and it comes under networking about 53.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:33.350
So this is wrote for 23 DNS management.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.620
Good starter.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.920
No clear.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.150
Create host of June.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.190
Relax,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.930
eat dark night.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:47.050
I'm giving and it is a private close to John.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.830
If it is publicly accessible,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.850
then we can use the public oestrogen.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.250
Now let's go to Mumbai region.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.850
This is the region we are using and created.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:05.120
So we have created a host of Jones for galaxy dot net No,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.450
let's go back again.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.710
No,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.400
we should create an s three bucket.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.840
This is the commander toe create from you were kubernetes management console but Anyway,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.810
we have already this bucket.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:24.700
Now we export this bucket so that cops can able to store the conflagrations in this bucket

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:24.700
.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.190
So we have exploited no generated.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.750
Keep here.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.650
This keep it is useful to largent over Kubernetes cluster.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.600
Without creating this,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.450
we cannot able to create cluster.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.480
No,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:48.750
this is the commander to create a cluster that is create cluster in your the bluest clothes

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.750
.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:56.530
Available to June Episode 21 b next kubernetes cluster name DNS.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.830
Joan name under the Dennis Dennis zipper.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.320
So it creates only definitions on store seen over areas.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.050
Three bucket.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:11.930
I will just assure you go to inside the bucket again.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.520
Inside.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.290
So these are the configurations which just got creatively.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.150
Others to 24th 6 40 Okay,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.330
no,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.700
it has been created.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.360
And if you want to modify a were clusters,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.670
that is a great comments under to set up our cluster.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.130
We should makes good this comment.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.820
But before doing that one,

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.390
I will just make sure that we are going to lunch Smaller instances.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:36.880
Otherwise,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.950
it is going to lunch bigger instances.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.500
So,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.300
master instance I'm going to launch it as you t too small,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.740
so toe change your master nor capacity.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.870
We need to edit this conflagration.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.810
Onda here,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.660
you can see See for large We really donors see for large.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:02.000
So I'm going with older it on a few other conflagrations.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.180
If you wish to change you continued here to set up our cluster.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.870
Actually,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.250
we should execute this command Sandy to takes 5 to 10 minutes.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.560
Once it is successful,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:22.390
we can valued it our cluster And it also displaced the comments which is required toe

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.950
execute after sitting up your cluster.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:37.520
Just let's see that So see here to validate cluster This is the commander to list North

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.470
Cube City will get north So levels two associates This is the commander with admin user.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.680
We should log in on This is the U.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.040
R L,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.680
which is going to create in our DNS will wait 5 to 10 minutes to validate our cluster.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.250
Then we'll jump into our master note.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:12:04.340
I feel just to show you this is wrote 53 on the road 53 record sets We can see

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:13.770
traditionally four record sets has been created under easy to We will get the three more

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:20.370
north must raise to two micro in the north 32 medium because we haven't changed the north.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:25.780
Let's wait until our cluster comes up.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.410
It takes 5 to 10 minutes.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.450
I'm just pausing this video.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:37.550
So let's validate over Cluster Still it is creating.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.950
Looks great.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.250
Let me read on the command again.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.170
Yes.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.470
Our close trees dirty No to log in Dover Cluster.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.490
We have your command.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.730
That is yes.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:58.450
A church on the key followed by admin user onto over clusters.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.660
Yes.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.550
I want a large in.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.700
Okay,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.850
I have locked into me.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.750
Kubernetes mustard No Become your route.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.370
Clear the screen.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:15.750
If I don Cube CTL what should Here?

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.650
You can see it is running with worsen 1.1 toe.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:24.300
We want to upgrade this one to the latest Cube city awash in for that again we can follow

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.320
the same documentation What we used to install on We're going to system.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.800
This is the one to install Cube City that is going toe.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.410
Don't Lord.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:44.030
And then we should change the permission on the move it into us.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:52.110
Our local bin No,

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:59.400
you play executes him Command This time we could see the latest worsen Right now we should

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:06.470
copy the deployment and service fields which are available in our get hub repository here

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.350
is ever get her.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.550
Let's go back onto Kubernetes.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.620
Here we help will actually deploy and relaxes service.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.250
Let's open this.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.070
Copy this file.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:21.450
Name,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.440
character,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.250
Greater them.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.480
Copy this content.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:35.250
And if you see here,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.410
it is going to create a deployment that is well,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.950
actually deployment with the two replicas on the rolling update.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:48.520
And it pollster you means And it is always pollster Late estimates internally utterance on

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.170
port number.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.360
Similar way.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.350
We should copy.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.850
Service plane.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:04.850
This is our service file on copies.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:12.410
Another thing.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.190
If you see here,

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.410
we are creating relaxes service and also happening.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.950
We are giving a civil accident box project and it is a load balancer type.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.200
We'll definitely run some port number.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.950
A jury Jiro exposed on port number Gero Gero externally accessible from 31 affordable Jiro

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:29.950
.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.760
Next we need to create answerable playbooks for that I'm going to bring up our and simple

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.530
server currently in Stopper state.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.750
Let me start it.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.950
Refresh it.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.850
Okay,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.670
it is running.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.860
Take type.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.550
Beatrice Shushan,

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.710
This is Hitch.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.890
I appeared herself and simple set of it.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.880
Keep aid and it is.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.380
Imagine,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:01.760
Lennox.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.310
So you see,

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.640
two minutes user on to change the display cities,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.750
terminal settings,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.090
background.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.050
I'm going to use the solar arrays of the dark.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.950
Okay,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.030
we have a lot doing.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.550
Let me increase the font size.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:27.310
Become here in a sudden That's it.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.250
Clear the screen.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:34.960
Now we want to enable password less authentication between answerable to our kubernetes

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.550
Master note for that we should copy ever Keep it on you.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.390
Dr.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:45.140
Associates are traded location off the server for that little goto.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.150
Darkest shich,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:54.450

in tow.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:01.150
Our trade the hosts India Kubernetes Master So in Beirut,

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.420
that's a suits.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.850
Let me cat operator Keys.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.710
No double great within our treasure kiss.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.950
I'm just operating my key over here.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.050
That's it.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.970
Clear of the screen Now Let me test the password Less authentication between these two.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:24.600
There's a shit Marinus I already under spare artists here I p address off this system.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.300
Let me take the public AP because both are in different three pieces.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.030
We cannot connect with private eye.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.790
Piotr assists Onda.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.950
We should like no zero to use that right?

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.450
The route art My purpose.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.960
Yes,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.830
I want to connect and you can see here you have locked into $61 to 31 which is the cluster

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.830
?

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.250
Very right.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.600
So pass wordless authentication is enabled.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:52.990
No,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.760
we should create answerable playbooks for that.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.050
Let's go toe a pity.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.850

Now we have set up whatever is required.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.810
Let's go insert two Cared slap Onda.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:55.290
We should create playbooks toe create images under execute our deployment on services.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:55.850
For that,

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:01.660
it is already updated in our get help repository and go back to Cooper Netease again.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.490
Oops,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.760

And also we have to create a host.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.660
Swell will create after creating this playbook.

Before executing these jobs,

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.880

We don't have any deployments.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.450
We don't have any services except to default.
