00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Hello,

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.930
folks.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome back.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.600
In previous lecture we have seen how can we limit to execute our answerable playbooks on

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.850
your specific system?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.670
In this lecture,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.820
I'm goingto modify our Jenkins job to execute those playbooks as part off our see a city

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.320
job so that we can see our enter.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.590
See,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.000
a CD pipeline is art aumentar for that purpose?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.650
I'm going to create a new job and I will name it as here.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:42.740
Deploy on darker Conde nut deploy on docker container using And I will copy this one from

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.450
our deploy on container using answerable.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.280
Okay,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.450
pronounceable playbook I will give.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.810
Okay,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.670
I'm changing description.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.630
Little bit next.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.270
If we scrolled on git repository,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.350
we don't change.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.780
Build it regardless.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.890
Elated before Lacey.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.060
Um so it is Polish seems off.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.550
Foster Bill will happen automatically whenever we sell this job.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.830
Then the goals We are not changing on the postal bill accents.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.750
This is where we need to change.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.610
Earlier,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.420
we were using only one playbook to create a Mazen container.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.730
No,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.850
it is two playbooks because we want to run into different systems.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.950
So the host fairly same earned the playbook name.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.540
Let me take it from the answerable server.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.050
Yes,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.570
Develop.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.750
Seem is dot William l This I want to run only on only on local host,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.850
local host to nothing but unanswerable server on the next thing.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.020
One more playbook.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.080
We want to run that playbook.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.550
We want to execute on target system.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.800
That playbook is created Container that is develops project to Doctor William on I will

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.390
limit.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.250
I will limited toe execute only on the doctor host.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.170
So what is the doctor?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.390
Who?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.950
ST Pete.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.550
It is 2 45 You can get it from Dr Server as well.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.240
I peered through the year.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.810
You can see 2 45 It is a privately Beatrice.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.870
So even though you if you stop and start,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.540
it was server,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.550
it won't change next up late and save it.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.480
So this time what will happen?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.190
This new job we have created And policy,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.920
um has been enabled it.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.260
I didn't.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.150
For the changes under execute the faster job.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.090
Let it takes a good on.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.440
Before executing,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.750
I will show you that our doctor hub How many comets are there?

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.850
52 comets are there.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.260
And if we go here on our doctor,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.530
sir.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.820
Well clear the screen Docker images you can see the latest emits six minutes.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:23.910
A good has been pulled Dark wood PS menace here Armed six minutes ago You container has

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:32.350
been created here you can see we have only tomcats are over now let's see.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.900
See,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.950
It's triggered a new bill Let me open the build output So it's exuding Second playbook on

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.950
the targets are were you can see the I P address initial when it works on only local host

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.850
It has been successful.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.960
Go to a doctor,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.220
huh?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.360
You can see here 54 comets I have one more Jenkins job which is using same repositories.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.670
Even that also pushed the limits to here.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.250
That's why it is 54.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.750
It has been updated and it is happened a few second single under here.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.250
Also,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:19.380
you play least ot mazes again This time it is a minute ago I learned that this is 43

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.150
seconds ago.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.340
This is how we can automate over inter process And I can still access my application from

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.550
the browser to validate our Jenkins job One more time I will modify our source scored on

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.650
push it into get herb repository currently these 15 commits.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.550
Next committee is going toe available over here.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.460
One source code is available.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:51.040
Our Jenkins job get exit route way Because we have enabled a polish Siem we have been able

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.710
to pull assume for every minute it should execute on the our playbooks.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.980
Also going to get eggs.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.350

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.910
Copy the latest.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.050
Where if I learned to answerable server creating a maze or tough it pushed Aim isn't or

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.740
darker hub Didn't the next commit will appear over here on the same will be pulled by over

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.670
Dr Server So latest amazes getting pulled under latest container gets creator on whatever

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.250
Okay,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.080
I'm using Jenkins over to update our court.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.710
Let's go toe over Jenkins server under ti's home directory we have you Hello world which is

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.150
pulled from our get herb repository.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.860

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.760
Okay.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.850
Deploying on your container using answerable playbooks Just I helped deterred Get status

let's go and see the Comets.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.550
16 comets.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.850
Let's go on to see over the job.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.650
Go back to over the child.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.290
It's not yet executed.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.690
Once it is executed,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.600
we can see the latest Where Friend?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.890
Yes,

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.850
it's executing.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:05.140
And if we go on and see our answerable server ls minus l That flame There is a minutes

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.730
Variation.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:15.950
We should get your latest to our file in this We're still not yet created.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.070
Yeah,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:26.370
I noticed of artful God created darker images you can see knew him is getting created.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.600
Yes,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:36.320
you can see latest images got created and these get pushed into our doctor Help notes Re

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.150
pressured here?

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.980
Yes.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:50.420
Latest comet has been done Then if you see here Dr Images currently promoted the Dockery

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.820
Mees.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.950
It created a new doctor.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:08:00.450
Remiss under creates in Yukon Dinner on the 33 sh our application from the browser.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.960
We could see the latest committee.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.410
Yes,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.770
I have inter touched anything as a developer.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.260
I just pushed my court.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.730
Andi,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.550
I could able to see the new application in my docker container.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.440
This is how we can set up here.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.950
Production really see a CD pipeline to deploy our applications.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.950
Now everything is working as expected so far.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.430
Now assume that due to some problem,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.000
you're a docker.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.450
Container is not working.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.100
We need to create it manually.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.350
Are we should rely on our chickens job.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.450
But Jenkins job takes good only if there is a new build.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.650
To overcome this problem,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.240
we should house some mechanism who can ableto take it.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.950
Our maintain our containers,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:53.110
that is we're Google comes operative product guard Coburn It is Cooper notices the

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:59.300
container Management service which can man is containers if it finds any faulty containers

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.460
it to replace is with the new one are deserted.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.870
Capacity off containers are not available.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.580
It creates new one how to set up kubernetes cluster under How can we integrate Cooper

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:17.610
notice with our answer Ballooned Jenkins job We are going to see in the next section until

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:17.840
then.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.320
Bye.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.150
See you there
