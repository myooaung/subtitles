00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hello,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.450
folks.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.150
If you have encountered this kind of error,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.910
then you can continue to watch this video other ways.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.650
You can skip it.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.570
Maybe you got structured over here that you were.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.720
Container is running,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.800
but you could not able to access the application from the ulcer.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.230
So let's give control.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.550
See?

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.750
Clear the screen.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.680
Dr.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.920
Images to check.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.230
You worry.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.750
Majors,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.860
you might help pull your latest to Tomcat to doctor images,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.810
which is updated eight days ago.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.160
Nothing.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.800
But in January 1st week and you might have run this command to create a container.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.350
Okay,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.870
so let's Ah,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.240
let's start our containers.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.730
Doctor.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.750
PS minus here.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.700
Currently we have your container.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.230
Okay.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.290
Exude the same command and remove if you have any containers over here to remove it.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.750
Dr Autumn and contain of name.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470
And if you see the container is running,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.570
then it throws an era so fast.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.850
Do darker Stop.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.650
Were container name our container.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.130
Ready,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.770
then,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.380
Dr Adam Container.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.460
Name our container.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.860
Ready?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.550
Okay.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.850
Now,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.570
if I check,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.030
we don't have any containers.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.050
Let's create our container again.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.890
But this time we are going to do it to the detached.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.750
More okay.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.380
Minus D this is detached more whenever you run in the detached from or cantina runs in the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.870
background so you can see here we were Container is running on different going Makes good

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.360
the same Commander Dr Pierce Menace here Now our container is running under up from three

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.860
seconds.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.260
No,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.960
let's access again our application and you can still see same error To understand this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.480
problem better Let's like in tower docker container and see to largent over docker

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.760
container darker e x C c is the command ICTY followed by your container name slash been

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.990
bash nothing but we are logging into over container with the bash Nothing but shell command

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.340
just to enter You can see here now you are inside the container This is over containing

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.660
already and you logged in as root only were under this location slash e waste our local

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.840
tomcat Let's give ls Now you can see here there is a direct recalled web.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.410
Usually our default application is available under web.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.570
If it is not available over here,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.390
you cannot access from the browser.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.350
That is the reason.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.870
Okay,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.350
but it is not your problem.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.250
Even we can store our custom applications over here.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.250
Once we start storing over applications over here,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.580
it starts working.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.250
Okay,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.590
on.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.420
We have one more folder called Web Doctor dissed.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.350
So in the latest container remains,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.000
they are storing their default application over here.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.950
So before talking about that one,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.350
let's going side to a bear.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.750
You can see here nothing is there.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.610
This is empty.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.300
That is the reason that is the reason it could not able to access the application,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.850
know to make it work.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.070
You can come out going said to the baps,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.830
dark dissed and you can see here this is our router directly.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.840
This is what we need.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.190
The underdogs examples.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.030
Everything is there.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.710
Let's copy this one onto were perhaps so that we can make it work over default application

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.710
.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.520
So cp minus are nothing but Rick actually start whatever content is available over here

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.200
copied out onto dark,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.430
dark river abs.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.850
OK,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.580
now you going and said to wear perhaps you can see the content on.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.050
Let's go on to refresh it.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.210
I'm refreshing it.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.760
You can see our default application.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.410
OK,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.610
so this is how we can make it work.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.390
But it is not their problem way because in later sessions,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.040
we are going to use our wound application rather than using their default application.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.750
So no need to worry whether it's working or not working.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.230
If you could able to see the there are prayers.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.570
Also,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.120
it's fine.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.620
But if you want to make it work,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.650
this is one off the way.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.050
Another way is you can just come out here.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.750
Are you clear the screen?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.850
Darker images.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.810
If you see we are using the latest image rather than using later.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.220
Steam is you can try to pull the little world remains so that we can make it work in the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.490
world.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.890
Remigius default Tomcat application is available under wraps directly.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.550
So you need not to do all this stuff.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.380
If you want to do all this stuff,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.470
you can do it in the doctor Fell,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.810
which we're going to discuss in the later stations.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.500
There.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.950
We can see how does it work?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.490
So to make it work,

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.620
what we can do Instead of pulling the latest Tomcat timis,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.250
we can pull little Walder.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.250
Let's do that one.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:39.430
I'm opening hub dot docker dot com on search for Tom Get this is Tom Cat,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.750
right,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.630
so this is our time.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.720
Cattle doctor Officially,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.520
major space.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.720
Let's in Christa size on if you scrolled All these are the supporter tanks.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.510
But let's go with standard one.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.950
If you scroll down a little bit,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.060
you can see here,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.340
Tom.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.090
Guard a door.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.590
Jiro,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.180
Let's go with this one.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.240
Tomcat Colon!

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.100
A dodgy row.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.350
So go here darker.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.850
Pull,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.880
Tom!

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.350
Kurt!

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.450
They Doctor Gero Let's pull this one.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.920
So let's create a container.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.580
Wrote off it,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.250
Dr Images.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.260
Now we have one more container.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.050
Imitator Jewelers created container out off it.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.100
Dr.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.650
Run minus D minus.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.450
Minus name.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.850
I am giving it as it Tomcat.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.490
Tomcat eight minus P port number.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.200
I'm using it.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.940
Generate one colon.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.580
Eijiro.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.170
Eijiro.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.710
Okay,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.650
Internet leads Johnson Port number,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.570
Age range zero.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.760
Exposing on to exaggerate one.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.960
This sport must be opened at security group level.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.120
It's already open.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.740
In my case,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.300
if it is not any workers,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.150
please open it.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.050
Unfollowed way,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.850
Tom Good.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.210
And we must to do the attack other ways to takes the latest one again.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.540
So a Daijiro that's excluded.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.840
It's created one more container on.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.980
But this time I will access my application from the age rate.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:12.950
One So let's take the public AP on the open in new tab on the access it on a generate one

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.130
you can see here it is working on it.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.730
Generate one.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.160
It is 8.0.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.040
Abortion are earlier.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.250
One is a 10.5 Clear.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.950
And if I go and check for my containers also,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.780
Dr Pierce Menace.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.810
Here you can see two containers are upon turning.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.230
One is from 10 minutes.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.880
Another one is from you Minute.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.400
Nothing but age rate.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.600
One clear.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.200
So this is how either you can use the latest one are you can use this one,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.450
but this lab.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.520
If you want to experiment,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.850
you can use this one in later classes.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.560
You can still continue to the latest one because we are not going to use the default

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.550
application.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.100
We are going to use our one application player.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.060
Thanks for watching.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.350
See you in the next video
