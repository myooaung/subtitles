00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,920
In this module we exposed the getRide method,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,320
which selects one record clear through to our UI and test tiers.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,109
We had implemented the functionality in a previous module,

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:19,320
but hadn't exposed it to the rest of our application.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,320
This in turn enabled us to implement a method to update one row in the database.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,177
After that we implemented the functionality showing the batchUpdate

7
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:39,000
features available in Spring JDBC to update multiple records. Next we're going to look at deleting records from our application.
