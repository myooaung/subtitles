00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:05,801
Let's add exception handling to our application to catch potential

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:09,389
database exceptions from being thrown to our client.

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,154
We're going to create an ExceptionHandler in our controller,

4
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:23,000
create a custom ServiceError class and then modify one of our methods to throw an error to test this functionality.
