1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,580
In our select all,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,440
we used an anonymous inner class for the RowMapper.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,270
Although this is a common use,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,950
you oftentimes will have the same RowMapper in a repository or

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,540
across repositories that you will want to utilize.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's refactor our select all to use an external RowMapper because we are going to also use it in our RowMapper for our getSingleRide.
