00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:03.078
As we just mentioned,

2
00:00:03.078 --> 00:00:05.806
I was going to show you two ways to get the project and the first

3
00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:11.494
way was just going through and downloading the exercise files from

4
00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:16.614
the Pluralsight course Exercise Files section and the second method

5
00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:17.877
is downloading from GitHub.

6
00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:21.351
I will let you choose which approach you want to take,

7
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:23.533
but the end result will be the same.

8
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.442
To set up the project from GitHub,

9
00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.808
you first need to fork the project to your own repository.

10
00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:33.543
Second, I have made a shortened URL for you to access the project,

11
00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:37.800
that will take you to the fully built out project on GitHub,

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.000
and once you've done that we'll walk through the setup of the project. Let's dive into that demo now.
