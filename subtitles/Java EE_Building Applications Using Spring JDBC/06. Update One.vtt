00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:06.375
Now that we have a method to retrieve a single ride we can use it to

2
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:10.096
retrieve a ride and then change something and submit it back to the

3
00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:11.675
database using an update statement.

4
00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.701
Let's build a test for this and then build out the pieces

5
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:25.000
through our controller service and repository tiers so that we can update our records in our database.
