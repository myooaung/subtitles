00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.310
There are a few prerequisites you'll need to do the examples in

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.290
this course. I am using Java 11. Java 11 is the most recent

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.760
longâ€‘term supported, or LTS, version.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.170
There have been other releases since then,

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.070
but 11 is the most current LTS. With Spring 5,

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.220
you're required to use Java 11 or later,

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.720
but most, if not all, developers are now using it for Java

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.190
development. I am assuming that you already know how to install

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.740
Java, so we won't be covering that in this course.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.240
I'm also going to use Maven in this course. I've been asked about

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.010
Spring Boot and I like it for a lot of situations,

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.410
the feedback that we often receive though is it's too much of a

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.040
black box for developers learning new technologies.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.060
Once you know how the underlying pieces work, it's a great tool.

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.360
Spring no longer offers up a way, though, to just download the JARs and you're

16
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.040
forced to use Maven or Gradle to download those dependencies.

17
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.410
There is a Pluralsight course on Maven. If you have more questions about that,

18
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.920
you can go research and follow it.

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.720
The next thing you'll need is an IDE. I'm using Spring STS,

20
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.740
which is just a flavor of Eclipse.

21
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.440
In fact, it's just rebranded Eclipse.

22
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.130
If you're already using Eclipse,

23
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.870
you can go ahead and just keep that and it'll work just fine, but I like

24
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.340
Spring STS because it has a lot of the common plugins installed and you don't

25
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.180
have very many, if any at all, configuration issues.

26
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.070
The steps for Eclipse and Spring STS should be nearly identical, if

27
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.850
not the same. For our web container, we're going to use Tomcat 9.

28
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.830
At the time of writing this course,

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.470
10 is still a release candidate, so 9 is the stable version. And

30
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.000
lastly for our database, we're going to use MySQL. MySQL has great tooling and is pretty user friendly.
