00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Before taking a closer look

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.008
at the Java collections framework,

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.004
let's talk a bit about who the course is for

4
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.001
and what you should know ahead of time.

5
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.008
If you're a Java developer who knows the basics,

6
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.007
this course is a great next step

7
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.006
for advancing your knowledge of the language.

8
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.003
It will teach you how to work

9
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.006
with the collection framework's interfaces

10
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.009
and data structure implementations.

11
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.007
These are some of the most heavily-used classes in Java.

12
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.007
So as a Java developer, you'll read and write code

13
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.004
that uses these data structures constantly.

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.008
That makes this course a great investment of your time

15
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.006
because you'll benefit instantly

16
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.007
and throughout the rest of your career.

17
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.008
There are a few things that you'll need for the course.

18
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.000
This course is great for Java developers

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.009
who want to advance past language fundamentals,

20
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.000
like variables, data types, and arrays.

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.007
However, it shouldn't be your first introduction to Java.

22
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.000
So if you've never worked with the language,

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.008
check out the LinkedIn Learning library

24
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:01.008
for an introductory course, like Learning Java.

25
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:05.001
To follow along with the course, you'll need to have JDK 11

26
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.009
and Maven installed on your machine.

27
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.006
You can run any operating system that you would like.

28
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.004
You'll also need an IDE.

29
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.005
I'll be using Eclipse throughout the lessons,

30
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.004
but you can follow along with your favorite editor.

31
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.001
Just know that you'll need to account

32
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.000
for any differences between the two.

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.006
That's all you need to get started with the course.

34
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll handle the rest.
