00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Kevin] After you learn the fundamentals of Java,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.009
there's no better second step in your learning journey

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.006
than the Java collections framework.

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:12.002
The framework provides data structures like lists, queues,

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:16.006
and maps that Java developers work with every day.

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.001
Having these data structures in your toolbox

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.005
is critical for coding everything from the most basic

8
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.007
to the most advanced Java applications.

9
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.004
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

10
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.009
I've built many complex systems with Java

11
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.000
throughout my career,

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.007
and all of them have used Java collections.

13
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.003
In this course, I'll teach you about the concepts

14
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.008
of the framework, its interfaces, and how to work with them

15
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.007
so you can put them into practice

16
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.001
and be successful with collections.

17
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.007
So if you're ready to level up with Java,

18
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.002
join me in my LinkedIn Learning course

19
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.000
to learn how Java collections

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
will help you deliver better solutions.
