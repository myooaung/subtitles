00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Handling data is an important part

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.000
of coding any application.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.001
That shouldn't be a big surprise,

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.004
because as people solve problems

5
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.007
in their daily lives and work,

6
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.008
they instinctively organize data.

7
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.009
Most applications handle work for people.

8
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.005
So, an application's code often arranges data

9
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.003
in a similar way.

10
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.009
So, to help us better understand collections,

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.002
let's start by talking

12
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:31.001
about some real life examples of how we organize data.

13
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.006
At some point in the workplace,

14
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.005
you've probably used a list

15
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.006
to plan a small project.

16
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.001
In the list, you organize a group

17
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:42.004
of tasks that are needed to complete the project.

18
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:47.001
We can refer to each of the tasks in the list as an element.

19
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.008
Each element holds a specific position in the list relative

20
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.008
to the others that is designated by a number.

21
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.006
The list also has an order which indicates

22
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.008
the sequence for completing the tasks.

23
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.007
Now lists are a great way to organize data,

24
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.002
but what if your project involved a team

25
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.008
and you wanted to take it a step further

26
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:12.000
by capturing who's working on each task?

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.001
You might decide to build

28
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.003
a map that captures those assignments.

29
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.005
So first, the team members' names are written down.

30
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.006
The names serve as the key of the map

31
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.003
that will associate with each task.

32
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:29.006
The keys are then associated with or mapped to values,

33
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.007
which in this case, indicate the tasks in the project.

34
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.008
Each of these key value pairs forms an entry

35
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.006
in our map that we can use to determine

36
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.004
who is working on each task.

37
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.009
Concepts like lists and maps are two basic tools

38
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.005
we use almost daily to organize data when solving problems.

39
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:55.005
In computer science, these are known as data structures,

40
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.002
and it's very common to find them built

41
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.006
into programming languages.

42
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.008
In Java, those data structures

43
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.009
are found in the Java Collections Framework,

44
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.000
which you're going to learn a lot more about in this course.
