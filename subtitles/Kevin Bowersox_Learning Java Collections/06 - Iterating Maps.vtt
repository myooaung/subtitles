- [Instructor] Traversing each entry in a map

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.005
can be challenging when first learning about collections.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.009
So let me show you how it works.

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.009
To do that, I'm going to start out

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:14.003
by invoking the entrySet method on our map,

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.008
and I'm actually going to assign this to a variable

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.008
so you can see the typing of the object returned.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.004
Now, as its name implies,

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:25.004
the entrySet is a set that contains entries.

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, the entry itself is a generic type.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.002
So first, we need to specify

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.000
the type of the key used for our map

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.006
and then the type of the values used for our map.

14
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.004
All right, so now we have the type of our variable

15
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:44.005
and I'm just going to name it CV for collection view.

16
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, let's talk about this for one minute.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.001
You'll notice that the returned object is a set,

18
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.006
so that means it extends the collection interface

19
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.000
and it also extends the iterable interface.

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.006
So we can use this set within the enhanced for-each loop

21
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.005
and that's typically how the entrySet is worked with.

22
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.002
Let's check that out.

23
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.001
So I'm going to go ahead and declare a for loop,

24
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.001
and then I'm actually going to copy

25
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.007
the type information for our entry

26
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.006
because that's what we're going to be iterating through

27
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:23.000
is the entries within that set.

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.009
So I'll go ahead

29
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.006
and place that on the left side of the colon.

30
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.003
And then on the right side,

31
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:32.000
we need to invoke the entrySet method again

32
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.002
in order to get our entrySet

33
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:36.002
that we're going to iterate through.

34
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:40.007
And then also we need to provide a name for the object

35
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.006
that's going to be assigned each entry.

36
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:46.007
Okay, so now inside the body of our loop,

37
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.000
we can work with the entry.

38
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.005
So let's go ahead and declare a variable of type room

39
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:56.003
and then I'm going to get the key from the entry.

40
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.002
Then we can get the guest as well

41
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.001
using the getValue method.

42
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.009
So now we have the room and the guest from the entry

43
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.001
stored into variables.

44
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.006
Let's go ahead and we can print these out to the console

45
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.001
just to see them.

46
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.007
So I'm going to go ahead and specify a pattern

47
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:17.005
to the format method that prints the two strings

48
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.006
and a new line character.

49
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.003
Then I just need to get the name of the room

50
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:25.002
and pass it in as the first argument to the pattern

51
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.008
and then I'll get the guest's first name.

52
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.004
Okay, so we can go ahead and execute this code

53
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.002
and you'll see that we iterate

54
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.008
through the entries in our map.

55
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.009
Before we wrap up, there's one more point I'd like to make.

56
00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.009
The entrySet is a collection.

57
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.000
So if you would like, you could also use a stream

58
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.009
to iterate through the entries in the entrySet.

59
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.001
So that's where we'll end our discussion

60
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.000
and exploration of the map.
