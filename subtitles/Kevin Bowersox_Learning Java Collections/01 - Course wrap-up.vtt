00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Kevin] Thanks for watching this course

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.002
on the Java collections framework.

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.004
Before we wrap up,

4
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.004
I want to provide you with some ideas on where to go next

5
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.004
and give you some information about my other courses.

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.002
Now that you're familiar with the basic collections,

7
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.002
I would recommend looking at the framework's

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.009
concurrent implementations

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.007
that handle multi-threaded scenarios.

10
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.002
You'll need to be aware of Java concurrency

11
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.003
to get the most from these collections.

12
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.008
So make sure you're comfortable working with programs

13
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.003
that handle more than a single thread.

14
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.003
In this course, we've also touched on Java streams,

15
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.001
which pair really nicely with collections.

16
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.002
If you dive deeper into streams,

17
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.006
you'll discover more operations to add to your Java toolbox.

18
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.002
Finally, we also highlighted generics in the course.

19
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.007
Generics are another section of the language you can explore

20
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.006
that will help you better work with collections.

21
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.003
If you like my teaching style,

22
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.007
I have a few other courses on the LinkedIn Learning platform

23
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.005
that might interest you.

24
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.001
I can teach you about other topics like GitOps,

25
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.009
Microservices, APIs, Java, Spring, or Git

26
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.001
if you're interested.

27
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.002
If you want to,

28
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.006
tag me when you post your course certificate.

29
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.009
I always like to interact with learners taking my courses

30
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.000
and celebrate their success.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.003
I'm also very active on LinkedIn,

32
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.007
so follow me or connect to be notified

33
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:25.001
when I create a new course or share some technical writing.

34
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.001
So that's it.

35
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.003
For now, congratulations on finishing this course

36
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.002
and thanks again for taking it.

37
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.002
Now it's time to put your new skills

38
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.000
with Java collections into action.
