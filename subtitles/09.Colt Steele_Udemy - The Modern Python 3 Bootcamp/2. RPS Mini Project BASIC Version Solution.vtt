1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.740
All right.

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.340
So let's start by building the basic version here.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.510
The first thing we need to do is create a new file.

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.230
So I'm going to call mine.

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.380
Let me clear this out.

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm going to make a new file called I'll just do V-1 dot P Why because I know I'm going to have a V-2

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.830
and I'll open that up.

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.660
OK.

9
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.090
And let's start by just printing a simple print statement that just says rock and let's just do a couple

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.130
of those and sublime.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:38.470
I'm using a shortcut to duplicate command shift D and will changes on to paper and friendly scissors.

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.580
So let's just make sure.

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.530
Obviously there is no complex logic but let's just make sure things are working.

14
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.290
So that's Python 3.

15
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.250
We wonder why we get our three print statements.

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.540
OK so now let's get our user one so we'll call it what color our users are players P1 or player 1 and

17
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.290
then Player 2.

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.720
So remember we can't do.

19
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.080
One player has to start with a letter.

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.040
So all go player 1 equals and then we'll use input.

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.340
So we need to start by just getting input twice.

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.440
So we'll just say Player 1

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.900
Make your move and I'm just going to pass a string into input rather than doing a separate print statement

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.390
and then I'll do the same thing for player to change the variable name to be Player 2.

25
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.750
This will be Player 2.

26
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.930
OK.

27
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.130
So make sure that that works.

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.250
Play one plays rock.

29
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.470
Player Two Plays paper and nothing happens.

30
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.070
So this is now the hard part.

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.240
This is where we need to add our logic.

32
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.090
So the way that rock paper scissors works I guess I should have started out by talking about this if

33
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.020
you're unfamiliar with how it works which I guess that's kind of kind of insensitive of me to assume

34
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.380
that all cultures were in my courses that in like 200 something countries I don't think that all of

35
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.270
them play rock paper scissors.

36
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.060
So there's these three moves rock will beat Scissors Paper beats rock and scissors beats paper.

37
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.130
And then if there's a tie rock versus rock it's a draw scissors versus scissors and so on.

38
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.300
So with this logic I'm going to start with the most basic kind of longest way of writing this the most

39
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.700
thorough solution not necessarily the best.

40
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.240
So we have Player 1.

41
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:38.370
So let's say if Player 1 equals rock so we can start with that and play two equals and we can let's

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.510
just pick scissors.

43
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.720
So in that case what happens if Player 1 is rock 13 scissors rock beats scissors.

44
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.900
So then we'll just print there one wins.

45
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.620
So if you can see where this is going we're going to have a bunch of these if statements are LFA statements.

46
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.270
So then we can have another Elif and just two if Player 1 equals rock so keep it at Rock and Player

47
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.590
2 this time.

48
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.090
Played paper.

49
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.940
If that's the case we'll print player 2 wins because I need my quotes.

50
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:29.470
Paper beats rock that we go and we could add the scenario of rock equals rock.

51
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.390
But instead we could have an elf that just says if Player 1 equals equals.

52
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.490
Player 2 will do a print and my colon here print.

53
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.240
It's a tie

54
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.140
so I'll leave that one at the bottom for now.

55
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.960
And you should also just add an else down here that just says maybe like something went wrong because

56
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.560
our game only works if users type in rock papers rock paper scissors if they tape some other character

57
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.620
or number or something.

58
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.020
A sentence in it could break our code.

59
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.320
Well it wouldn't break things it just they wouldn't see any result.

60
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240
So let's add this and that just says something went wrong.

61
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.380
OK so let's continue with our logic.

62
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.200
So next let's say if player.

63
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.120
So we've we've covered all the bases if Player 1 plays rock rock versus scissors rock versus paper and

64
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.820
rock versus rock.

65
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.200
Now let's do.

66
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:35.350
Player 1 plays paper and Player 2 plays rock.

67
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.410
Let's go with that.

68
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.180
So in that case what happens.

69
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.110
Well if I play one paper versus Rock Paper beats rock.

70
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.660
So that means that player 1 wins and let's do the next scenario.

71
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.940
Player 1 now is also paper.

72
00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:03.770
But this time player 2 plays scissors at a space here just to keep it consistent it's not going to change

73
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.150
how my code works.

74
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.660
I just want to be consistent in my formatting.

75
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.280
So if that's the case who wins.

76
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.230
Paper versus scissors player 2 wins.

77
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.580
OK.

78
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.660
And why don't we just test our logic at this point.

79
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.450
So we're still missing the scenario where Player 1 plays scissors at all but we'll get back to that.

80
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.290
So let's test it.

81
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.810
See if we have any syntax errors.

82
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.250
OK.

83
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.560
So let's start with rock and then Player 2 will also play rock.

84
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.560
Let's see what happens.

85
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.490
OK good.

86
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.060
It's a tie.

87
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.550
Player one plays rock.

88
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.300
Player Two Plays paper.

89
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.760
Player Two wins.

90
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.330
OK.

91
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.710
So things were looking good.

92
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.010
We just need to finish up with our logic.

93
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:56.580
So next we'll have if Player 1 plays scissors and let's say player two plays rock.

94
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.200
What happens in that scenario.

95
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.030
OK.

96
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.620
Well Rock beats scissors.

97
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.900
So that means that player 2 wins again.

98
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.790
And finally we have our last scenario which is Player 1 place scissors.

99
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.560
I can never spell scissors and Player 2 is paper.

100
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.120
And in that scenario.

101
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.630
Scissors beats paper.

102
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.210
So we print player 1 wins.

103
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.310
So this should be our complete logic for this is the most verbose longest way of writing this but it

104
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.760
covers all of our bases.

105
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.960
And I guess Actually that's a lie we could have been even more verbose and just written.

106
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.500
If Player 1 plays rock and Player 2 plays rock Rockit to tie type.

107
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.950
Player one play scissors and paper to play scissors.

108
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.710
It's a tie.

109
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.460
But instead we just combined them in single line.

110
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.560
OK let's make sure everything works.

111
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.560
So make some space and recall a line.

112
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.860
All right.

113
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.110
So let's say play one play scissors.

114
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.800
Player Two plays rock.

115
00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.810
Who should win.

116
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.060
Player 2 this time.

117
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.980
Scissors versus paper.

118
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.180
Player one wins.

119
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.330
And let's do paper versus rock.

120
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.330
Player 1 wins.

121
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.730
OK.

122
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.610
So things are working.

123
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.150
If you got to this point congratulations this is really all that we need for the base functionality

124
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.860
of the game in the next video.

125
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.030
I'm going to refactor this slightly because this is kind of cumbersome in my opinion.

126
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.250
We can actually break up these conditionals into some nested conditional statements.

127
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.500
They'll make things a little cleaner.

128
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.570
In my opinion it's just a matter of taste.

129
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.280
So I'll show that in the next video and then after that video we'll have the more advanced version where

130
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.710
we add in a random computer player.

131
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.390
OK.
