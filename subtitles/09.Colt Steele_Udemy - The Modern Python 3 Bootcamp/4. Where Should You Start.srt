1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,990
So this video is all about finding your path not finding your path in life.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,310
You know I'm not going to tell you to express yourself.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,630
Don't be afraid to try new things.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,680
Pay attention to your dreams that sort of thing.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,850
No I mean find your path through the course.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,090
There are different places that you could start depending on your skill level and the computer that

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,560
you're working with.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,660
So I made a flowchart.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,310
I spent way too long on it and it looks just awful.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,700
So I'm really sorry about that.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,920
I'm not a designer as you probably noticed looking at these slides but here goes nothing.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,480
Where should you start.

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,850
The first question is.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,430
Mac or PC.

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,480
Mac slash any Linux machine or Unix machine is the same.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,790
So really it's just.

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,900
Do you have a PC.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,420
If you do then the first question is are you comfortable using power show if you don't know what that

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,260
is then you're going to start with the Windows PC Power Shell section.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,530
If you do you can start by installing Python on a PC.

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,260
Likewise on the Mac section.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,670
Are you comfortable using the Mac terminal if you are go ahead to installing Python on a Mac if you're

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,960
not focused on the Mac command line section.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,210
So we use the command line throughout this course other Python courses find ways around it where they

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,690
have to use some some visual tools or Iguchi to get things done which works it's just not how most developers

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,680
do things.

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,240
So I preferred to be a little bit more realistic kind of teach the things that I would teach my students

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,930
in person.

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,640
But the only downside is that it's a little bit longer to get started if you're not comfortable with

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,320
the terminal.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,710
But it's only I don't know 13 minutes 14 minutes of video so it's not too bad.

34
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,220
So this is the game plan.

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,260
Wherever you start there are two PC centric sections into Mac centric sections and then everything meets

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,320
up for all the Python content.

37
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,180
So if you have a PC and you don't know anything about power shell and the command line you start here.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,550
If you have a PC and you are comfortable with the command line then you start here and you install Python.

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,150
Either way this is a short section and you start installing Python very quickly.

40
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,370
This is only three videos in this section and then we dive into Python syntax.

41
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,830
Same thing on a Mac.

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,710
Start using the command line and going through that section.

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,660
If you're not familiar with it if you are just start with installing a very short section three videos

44
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,480
onto Python and then from here on out it's all the same.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:31,050
On top of that if you've already been programming in other languages before then some of this content

46
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,750
early on is going to be very slow for you because I teach things like variables and data type strings

47
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,190
and numbers operators comments which are very basic concepts in any language.

48
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,440
So if you've experienced those concepts with other languages then you may want to breeze through some

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,270
of this content.

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,580
You absolutely do not need to sit through every second video.

51
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,650
And in fact the exercises can serve as a way for you to check your own understanding.

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,660
You can skip ahead try an exercise.

53
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,330
And if you don't get it then you know that you need to go back and watch some videos leading up to it.

54
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,580
So there's a couple of options as you can see on the ugly flowchart.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,230
Figure out where you should start.

56
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,120
I know the terminals not the most exciting thing and it can be intimidating but there's only two or

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,600
three commands that I'm going to show you.

58
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,750
And we need to use them there's a real reason we use them throughout the course we use a terminal to

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,860
actually execute Python scripts.

60
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,460
So we need to know how to do that.

61
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,190
All right.

62
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,070
One more video.
