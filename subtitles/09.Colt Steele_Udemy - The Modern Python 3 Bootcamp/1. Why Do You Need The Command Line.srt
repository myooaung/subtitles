00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,460
Hey welcome to this new section on the command line for PC users.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,280
So I'm going to keep this very short and try and get us on to Python as soon as possible.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,700
But first I want to talk about why I even have the section in the course.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,120
Why bother with knowing any command line.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,970
And by the way if you do know some command line commands you're comfortable making files navigating

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,170
changing directories that sort of thing.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,110
Then skip this entirely and move on to installation.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,730
OK.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,370
With that said our goals in this section are to define what the command line is and talk about why you

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,080
should care.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,300
Learn some basic command line navigation and the basics of how the file structure works and then we'll

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,610
learn to manipulate files and folders using the command line.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,390
OK.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,160
So let's talk about what the command line is and why you should care.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,200
The command line is basically just an interface to your computer.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:00,130
Growing up I was used to using my mouse and a Gooley a graphical user interface if I needed to find

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,700
a file I would click double click.

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,870
Here's a file.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:12,190
I found it gay then double click to open it or you know it's another example I would go in here and

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:18,250
to move a file I could click this and then move it into that directory and that would be one example

21
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,140
of using a graphical user interface.

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:26,520
Whether it's on a Mac or a PC the command line however is a text based interface.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,110
So it's definitely uglier.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,500
It's not as pretty but it's also way faster and also more powerful.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,540
It's a lot of things you can do using the command line that you can't do otherwise.

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,340
So there are special keywords we type in.

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,150
I mean you've probably seen this before if you're new to IF you're completely new to the command line

28
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:49,090
you still have probably seen it in movies where hackers are typing and typing code really fast and the

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,550
text scrolling by and all the stuff is happening.

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
That's usually supposed to be a command line interface that you see in those films.

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,070
So here's an example of something that you couldn't do without the command line.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,890
If I copy this command and move over to my shell This is the command line and I'll talk about how we

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,290
get this how we open it up what Power Shell is in just a moment.

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,410
But we're going to show you if I paste that command in and I hit enter it goes through every process

35
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,640
on my computer.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,770
Hundreds of them and finds everything that's currently running and printed out so we can see there's

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,870
things like let's see web account manager storage service.

38
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,190
I mean I don't know what 95 percent of these are actually doing but this is happening behind the scenes.

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,180
And our command line provides a interface a window into that world that we wouldn't be able to see otherwise.

40
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,010
But that's not really why you should care about it for this course.

41
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,730
It is cool.

42
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,800
It's powerful.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,410
But for this course it really comes down to one thing and one thing only to run Python.

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,460
We need to have a command line where I can type the python command.

45
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,290
So if you tried this on your command line right now if you haven't installed Python if you're on Windows

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,430
this won't work.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,920
You'll have to wait until we get to the installation section.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,750
If you're on a Mac or a Linux based machine then usually comes with Python pre-installed.

49
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,840
So I'm getting ahead of myself.

50
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,910
But the point is we need to be able to use the command line to run Python and we need to be able to

51
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,480
navigate using the command line.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,090
For example if there's a folder on my desktop I'm going to show commands that we haven't seen yet.

53
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,030
We're going to learn them in this section.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,200
I could find that file and then execute it with Python.

55
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,180
And this is where we're going we have to be able to find a file with the command line so I can run python

56
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,630
on the file.

57
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,110
This file contained to my code and it's a very silly app.

58
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,170
All it does is print Hello 10 times.

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,460
But the point is we need to be able to do this.

60
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,340
We're going to write our code somewhere and then save it on your desktop you probably will have a bunch

61
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,980
of folders.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,190
We have a bunch of files in this course we need to be able to save them and then find them in the command

63
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,950
line which again it's just another interface.

64
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,090
I already showed you this file actually using the gooey with the double clicking on the folder.

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,270
I did the same thing through the command line and then I executed it.

66
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,020
And I couldn't do that without the command line.

67
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,750
So in the next video I'll have you know start writing code will dive into power shell talk about the

68
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,450
differences between PCs and Macs and then start running command.

69
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,540
As soon as possible.

70
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,590
So that's pretty much all I wanted to cover.

71
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,450
Just know that the command line if you've never used it it's not as intimidating as it seems.

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,520
It could be if you had to get into some very serious intense system level stuff.

73
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,370
But for what we're going to use it for just finding files and folders making new files and folders and

74
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,550
most importantly executing files with Python.

75
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,930
It's not that bad.

76
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,460
It might be a little slower than what you're used to up front because most people who are new to it

77
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,670
are comfortable with the mouse but it's worth it in the end.

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,100
And it's also what you'll see me using in the course.

79
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,360
So if you do want to follow along with exactly what I'm doing then the command line is what you'll need

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
to use.

81
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,910
All right.
