1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,460
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,450
So this entire section is all about the command line also known as the terminal.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,040
It's not the most glamorous thing ever but it's really really important for the rest of this course

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,290
and I'll be really upfront.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,550
We're not covering any Python in this section which I know might be a little bit of a bummer but it's

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,580
for really good reason.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,970
We have to have a solid understanding of mastery of the basics of using the command line in order to

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,320
move forward with Python.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,760
In fact we'll be using the command line and pretty much every single video from here on out.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,520
So we got to start here but we'll keep it quick.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,490
Keep it to the basics just the minimum you need to know in order to work with python.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,760
Oh I should mention I did add a couple of videos and photos of my two adorable cats.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,450
Somewhere in this section.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,530
So I don't know maybe that will help you get excited about it.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,040
If you're not excited OK so let's start by talking about our objectives in this section.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,080
There's a couple key things that we want to take away to prepare us for working with Python And The

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,920
first is we got to define what the command line is.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,370
Pretty straightforward.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,130
What is it and why should you care.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,970
Then we're going to learn the basics of command line navigation and file structure along with that.

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,320
We'll learn how to manipulate files and folders using the command line.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,020
So we'll be able to look at folders and files create new ones to the existing ones.

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,780
Move them around that sort of thing.

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,560
So those are the three key points we want to take away from the section.

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,260
Like I said I'm going to keep it brief.

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,400
If you already feel comfortable doing these three tasks relate to the latter two if you're good navigating

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,040
your file structure creating deleting moving files and folders around then you might be able to just

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,150
skip this section entirely and move on to Python.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,230
But if you're not confident in your ability to do that.

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,780
Hang in there.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,850
This will be quick and like I said keep photos of my cats so let's get started.

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,050
So what is the command line.

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,530
What's it do to put it shortly.

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,250
Or not so surely in this case the command line is a faster and more powerful way to maneuver your operating

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,420
system.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,600
So if you're on a Mac you might be familiar with the Mac Finder or on Windows the Windows Explorer.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,970
These are graphical user interfaces so if you've never used a command line this is how you interact

39
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,790
with your computer.

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,360
Use your mouse.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,310
We can open up files.

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,950
You know you can click on things you can delete by dragging to the trash or right clicking depending

43
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,290
on the system that you're on.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,940
This is how the majority of people interact with their computer and it works great but the command line

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,110
works better.

46
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,400
It's a little uglier.

47
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,910
That's probably the hardest roadblock to get past.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,290
It's just text but it's faster and far more powerful.

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,630
Once you kind of get up and running with it.

50
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,560
So rather than using our mouse to click on things and double click and drag items we use special keywords

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,610
just text so these special keywords that we're going to learn.

52
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,840
But you do everything you can do with a graphical user interface plus a lot more.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,650
So here's a quick example.

54
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:04,140
Here's a command and it's pretty trivial silly example but what it will do is search in a file called

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,450
report that TXI.

56
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,680
So an existing file.

57
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,620
And let's say this file is filled with out and ten thousand lines of text.

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,990
This SCD command said is going to then search this file for all instances of the word dude and it's

59
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,040
going to replace it with my name.

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,430
But it's going to take the result of that with all the replaced dudes into a new file.

61
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,080
It's going to make call report new dirty XTi.

62
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,050
So again we're going through file reports that replacing all instances of the word dude with cold and

63
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,320
storing that all in a new file called Report new data 60 in a single line.

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,070
And most of this is something you probably don't need to do often.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,830
If you had to do this with the UI or gooey it takes a lot of work.

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,300
At best you would need to open up the report file.

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,230
Maybe your text editor has a way to find and replace.

68
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,300
So even if you find and replace using your editor rather than doing it manually you then still have

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,050
to save the result.

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,820
Copy it.

71
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,260
Make a new file open.

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,640
Not in a new application.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,720
Paste the new code in their saved report.

74
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,590
New data 60 and it takes a lot of time.

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,720
And that's just one silly example but pretty much everything that we do is going to be faster.

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
Using the command line.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,550
So that brings us to the next thing which is how are we going to use it in this course.

78
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,920
And really why why do we need to even talk about how to relate to Python.

79
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,580
Well first off we're going to use a terminal to just navigate around our files so we'll have around

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,890
a hundred or more files maybe 20 different directories for this course and will use the command line

81
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,680
the terminal to navigate through them to create and remove new folders and files to move.

82
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,440
Copy and paste those files and most importantly as far as how it relates to Python.

83
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,800
We need to use the command line to actually run code as Python.

84
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,480
So we're going to write code and files of say a file called my code.

85
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:02,160
Python IPY just putting code in a file doesn't really do anything have to execute it using Python.

86
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,530
So we need to be able to navigate through our folders find the correct file and then execute Python

87
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,040
with that file.
