1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,460
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,590
So this video is on external modules which is a topic that I always love to teach because by the end

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,710
of this video we'll be doing some fun things.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,720
We're going to get some colors printed out in our terminal using Python.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,710
We're going to print ASCII art Star Wars style scrolling text things that right now we're not really

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,620
capable of.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,270
But we're going to talk about external modules that will help us accomplish that.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,970
So a quick review we've seen built in modules that come with Python.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,630
We include them using import.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,490
We've seen how to define custom modules we know make code in a file and then we import it using the

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,870
import statement.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,920
Now we're talking about external modules.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,240
And these are modules that exist online on a server basically Python developers all around the world

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,990
develop modules packages and they can push them up online so that anyone else like us can go download

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,500
them and use them in our code.

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,040
So here I'm on a Web site called pi.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,490
Pi is probably how it's pronounced IPY.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,670
Python dot org.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,660
If you just search for Python packages it's called the Python package index and on here you can see

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:13,300
that there's currently over 120 4000 different packages that Python developers have contributed.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,490
And they range from really commonly use things down to really need.

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,570
Weird sometimes funny packages.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,730
And we can actually go to browse over here and they will be broken down into categories.

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,620
So there's things like what do we have.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,710
Natural Language Processing.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,080
Mac specific what else.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,180
Desktop development packages Internet packages graphics and audio packages so you know here's sound

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,120
synthesis.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,010
There are packages that will help us generate.

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,140
I don't know squarewave or make make noise make musical applications or under speech.

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,500
There's probably some packages that will actually help you know that you could convert text to speech

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,140
or something using Python.

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,540
Let's see if we scroll through some of these.

34
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,970
This is under the sound and audio speech category.

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,680
We have things like what do we have here.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,700
Python's simple text a speech module a robot that receives voice commands to play albums from an MP

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,310
3 collection called Music Butler.

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,290
So like I said some very specific uses but then there are packages that do much more common things like

39
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,690
help you develop web applications or what we're going to focus on the first package you'll see is just

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,430
a way to add color to our print statements.

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,200
Right now all of our print statements are just default terminal colors.

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,060
So for me black and white but we'll see a way to say I want this to be green and this to be purple.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,140
So I've showed you all these packages on Monday exist.

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,390
How do we install them and use them.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,330
And the secret is you need to use something called Pipp P IP.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,160
It doesn't really stand for something officially on Wikipedia.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:01,010
It says it stands for Pip installs packages which is a recursive definition which maybe that's the original

48
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,990
but it people to say Pip it's a way of installing these packages.

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,050
And it used to be a separate thing.

50
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,930
But now as of three point four Python three point four it comes installed when you install Python.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,140
So we don't have to install anything we don't have to do anything in order to use Pipp.

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,850
All we do is we run Python 3 dash em.

53
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,850
Pip.

54
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,930
Install.

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,310
So this is always the same.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,720
And then the name of a package.

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,570
So the first package that we're going to work with is called term color.

58
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,730
Here's the page the documentation page for it.

59
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,580
And it just lets us print color text.

60
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:46,740
So very simple and straightforward we can do things like print hello world as read and you can get fancy

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,220
and make it blink in the terminal or reverse and there's different things you can do.

62
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,720
But the first thing we have to do is actually install term color.

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,450
So using this syntax Python 3 dash em Pip install.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,000
Open your command button and run it with term color or if you have another package you're trying to

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,450
install replace the name with.

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,160
Replace term color with the name of the package.

67
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,590
I already have it installed and so it tells me that term color requirement already satisfied.

68
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,710
But if you don't have it installed it might take a moment.

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:25,080
It's going to actually download it and now we have access to it in our python files.

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,540
So I'm going to make a new file.

71
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm just going to call it colors.

72
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,280
Why.

73
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,420
And the first thing we need to do is import term color OK and back in the docs.

74
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,150
The documentation is not that amazing on here.

75
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,860
It tells us things like the colors that we can use.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,110
Unfortunately no purple.

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,440
It shows some examples but there are two builtin methods or two built in functions that we can use to

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
help us out.

79
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,510
And the first one is called Dear D R and what it will do is tell us the list of names that a certain

80
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,930
package or module comes with or any object they will be clear if I show an example.

81
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:14,650
So in here I'll run print Diyar term color and if I execute this now it just tells us the attributes

82
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,870
that are in those two colors highlights and then there's a function called colored.

83
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,140
Another one called see print.

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
So this isn't that useful.

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,870
Also we can see some other things in there but this is on its own.

86
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:33,010
Doesn't help that much but there's a second built in function called help and help will show us documentation

87
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,070
for whatever objects we pass in.

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,530
So let's do help term colored and now look up we get noticed we don't have to print it.

89
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,550
By the way my terminal is taken over and we get a little overview of the functions.

90
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,190
So there's one called colored and take a look at this.

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,770
We've taken the text that we want.

92
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,230
Are we pass in a text that we want to be colored.

93
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,270
We specify a color.

94
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,510
We can also specify on color which is the background and then we can see available text colors red green

95
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,820
yellow blue magenta cyan whites text highlights attributes.

96
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,580
We can do blank or reverse concealed.

97
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,830
OK so back in my file.

98
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,860
Let's undo that or delete the help and let's try running this colored function so we'll just start simple

99
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,260
pasand some text like.

100
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,450
Hi there and then a color which we could just pass in as read or something.

101
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,820
But let's do keyword argument and do Suyin like that and there's going to be a problem right away.

102
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,500
Can you spot it.

103
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,530
Colored is not going to exist.

104
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,950
It's going to be a name error and that's because we either need to do term color dot colored or what

105
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,030
I prefer From term color.

106
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,930
Import color or colored just like this.

107
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,430
Now I should be able to access it.

108
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:03,860
But the thing is if I run this Python 3 colors nothing happens and that's because by default this doesn't

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,290
actually print anything.

110
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,350
So let's save it to a variable.

111
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,130
Just called text.

112
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,630
Now we can print text.

113
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,270
I could also just put the print to this directly but the it just returns like a string that's ready

114
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,650
that has the color information encoded in it and then we need to print it when we want to and that that

115
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,640
blue text or cyan.

116
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,390
Let's also let's play around and do magenta

117
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,330
cool and remember if you want to see a list of the colors you can always type help again.

118
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,880
You could also just go into Python 3 and the terminal like this.

119
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,340
And if you just try and do help turn color you're going to get an error but you need to import term

120
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,660
color and then do help turn color.

121
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,690
And we can see OK so we've got red green blue yellow blue.

122
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,680
So things like orange purple Those aren't there available textiles.

123
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,460
So let's do on magenta and make R-TX yellow.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,510
Let's try that.

125
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,140
See what happens.

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:16,070
So that's going to be color is yellow and then on color equals and we have to do on magenta.

127
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
It's not magenta it's on magenta.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,220
Let's see.

129
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,390
Oh I get a quilt out of here first.

130
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,510
Try it very ugly but it works.

131
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,130
That's magenta.

132
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,800
Let's switch that around.

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,990
Anyway we need to be about aesthetics so much but let's do it on yellow instead.

134
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,080
Oof that yellow is just terrible.

135
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,880
Q How about Green

136
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,780
find enough.

137
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,100
The other thing that I'll mention is that I won't open up help again but there's another thing another

138
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,900
parameter argument we can pass in called adder's and it's actually a list and if we pass and blink and

139
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,460
I only know this because I looked at help but I just don't want to make you watch me open that up multiple

140
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,870
times so Blinkx

141
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,670
Oh it's really hard to see at the end.

142
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:24,270
I mean get rid of the green let's do on Suyin and make the color magenta OK.

143
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,790
Now you can see it's blinking.

144
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,240
Ok cool.

145
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,990
So hopefully you can see how this is exciting.

146
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,340
Yeah.

147
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,270
It's just colors but that's something we don't know how to do.

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,190
Frankly I don't know how to do it.

149
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,970
I don't think it's that hard.

150
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,660
You have to learn to like these weird.

151
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,230
They're called the see color code or something.

152
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,720
A NSI something like that and maybe two eyes.

153
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,010
So it's not impossible by any stretch.

154
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,740
It's just something I don't know about.

155
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,200
But why not just use a nice little package called term color that does it for me so I can just specify

156
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,910
colored.

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,450
There's a little interface they say the color I want the background color to be blinking.

158
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,490
It's nice and it's pretty easy.

159
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,190
And we use pipit to install it.

160
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,330
So in the next video we're going to continue to use this but we're going to try building something with

161
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:10,560
it.
