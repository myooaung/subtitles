00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,960
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,230
So the last little bit of this crash course on sequel is going to do with selecting data out.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,930
We've already seen how to select star select everything in a table.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,270
Now I'm going to show you how to select certain parts do certain queries that are a little more specific.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,860
Again this is there's a lot that we could talk about.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,960
A short video.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,580
This is really just so that we can then learn how to select using Python.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,770
Coming up in just a video or two.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,400
All right.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,020
So back to our database here.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,960
There we go.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,210
We've seen how to do this.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,030
So let's start from dogs.

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,730
What that star is saying is select all columns.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,960
It's not saying select all dogs.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,540
It's saying select all colors.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,900
So if I wanted I could just say select name from dogs or select name Karma age from dogs.

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,250
And that's just specifying which pieces of the dogs.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,890
But it's still giving me all of the dogs what I can of course narrow things down filter things a bit

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,410
more.

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,660
But before I do that I'm actually going to insert a few more.

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,090
OK.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,530
So here are four more dogs that I'm going to insert just so we have a little bit more of data to work

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,710
with.

25
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,580
So all the way back over here I'm just going to read that file again and notice I commented out everything

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,590
else.

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,850
So it's only inserting new dogs.

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,610
So now if I do select star from dogs we have a little larger data set still not a ton.

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,040
So we've seen how to select individual columns but now let's filter it down so that we could select

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,920
only certain dogs.

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,700
Let's say we only want the dog whose name is piggy.

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,540
For some reason.

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:49,230
Well I would say select star from dogs where name and then I would say is piggy is capitalized isn't

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,300
it.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,720
And I need my semi-colon.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,580
Forgot about that.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:01,650
So I had to hit it on a second line down here and we get piggy or let's select all dogs where their

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:09,590
breed is it what do we have to have a husky.

39
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,230
And now we get our two huskies and at the same time I could narrow it down and say only give me the

40
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,780
names of those dogs.

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,860
Champ and river.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,710
But of course there's a lot more we can do.

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:28,990
If you go to the documentation for Sequel light you can click on select and you get these lovely charts.

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,960
They're actually pretty cool.

45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,180
They show you the way the language is processed the syntax how it breaks down.

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,880
So there's a lot of different things that we can do but what we're focusing on is this little bit called

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,110
expression.

48
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:49,000
So we're saying select something from dogs where expression so where name is Charlie but we can also

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,980
say where age is less than 10 or something like that.

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,130
If you scroll down somewhere where is that expression right here and you click this is kind of hidden.

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,840
This shows us all of the options for those expressions there's a ton and it's very calm.

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,610
It can get complex.

53
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,800
What we're going to focus on are simple things like not so we could select all dogs who are not a corgi

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,380
or Hudes ages not between certain numbers.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,970
There's different things that we can do.

56
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,520
So if you want to see a specific breakdown of all that you can actually see it here but I'm just going

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,320
to show you a couple of simple examples.

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,990
So let's start by saying.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,660
Let's say I really hate him.

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,600
I really this is not true.

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,610
Let's say I don't like chihuahuas.

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,730
I'm not in love is too obvious but I don't hate them.

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,670
Let's say I don't I want to select all dogs who are not too obvious.

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:50,250
So I would say select star from dogs where breed is not Chihuahua.

65
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,720
Make sure spell right.

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,570
And there we go.

67
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,170
Oh that didn't work.

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,260
Notice we got Rowse right here.

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,160
And that's because it's capital C and now she is excluded.

70
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,990
Sorry Rose.

71
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,540
I can also chain things together so I can say leps I don't like chihuahuas or terrier's.

72
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,930
I don't want small dogs or pugs.

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,580
But a lot of work to type all of them.

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,570
So I'd say or breed is not and let's say pug.

75
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,490
Sure.

76
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,240
And I'm an idiot that likes everything because I can't do boolean logic.

77
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,730
The problem with that is it's saying select all the dogs where the breed is not to our or the breed

78
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,930
is not pug what we want is select all the dogs who are neither Chihuahua nor pug.

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,640
So I would say and breed is not pug and there we go.

80
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,190
Now we don't get the Chihuahua or the pug in there.

81
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,200
Sorry to Rose and Maggie.

82
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,410
Other things we can do I can select all dogs and say I don't want to adopt a puppy so select start from

83
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:06,970
dogs where age is greater than say I guess we only have one.

84
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:15,120
Let's say I want a dog who is older than 9 or all get us Rowse say older than 8.

85
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,770
OK now we get piggy and Rowse this is not a very comprehensive intro into selecting a sequel.

86
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,560
It can get very complicated when you start changing things together.

87
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,910
And we have to worry about multiple tables and joining them and that's not what we're doing here.

88
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,450
Of course one last thing I will mention because this can be useful if you're doing a search and you

89
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,210
don't you're not doing an exact match search.

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:46,010
Let's say this is trivial but I want to find dogs that have a name that has two g's in them together

91
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,710
g followed by G.

92
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:56,810
I could say select star from dogs where name and I wouldn't say where name is Gigi because that is only

93
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:03,800
going to find dogs with an exact name of Jiji which I think I've met a couple of dogs named Gigi although

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,550
not spelled that way but instead we would say where name like Gigi and won't work on its own but we

95
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,720
add in these two little wildcards percent signs and that basically represents any characters any characters

96
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,070
two G's together anywhere.

97
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,750
And now we get piggy in Maggie.

98
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,500
So there are some number of characters before and after but two G's same thing here.

99
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,700
So that's what those percent signs mean.

100
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,190
They just stand in for other stuff and then two G's together.

101
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,530
All right.

102
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,190
So that was a very fast and probably not very comprehensive introduction to sequel basic's we haven't

103
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,130
even talked about things like updating data deleting things but that's alright because it's not really

104
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,690
the point of this.

105
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,690
I want to just now move over to Python land and talk about how do we do this stuff from Python.

106
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:57,140
How do we make a table connect to a database first and then how do we submit queries how do we get things

107
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,060
to happen from a python file.
