00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.060
A welcome.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.050
So in this video we're continuing on talking about logic and boolean logic in particular things that

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.420
return true or false.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.160
So we saw comparison operators.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.030
Hopefully that was straightforward.

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.020
Now we're going to take it up a little bit and learn how to actually combine these together.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.080
Chain them in different ways using what are called logical operators.

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.510
So these are also tools that we can throw into any IF OR ELSE statement but they work slightly differently

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.030
in that they actually connect other comparison operators together.

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.600
So they basically help us make more complex logical statements.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.970
So I'm going to just show them to you first and name them.

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.840
So we have and or and not those of the three.

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.140
And we'll start off by talking about and the idea here is that there are two sides to an end.

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.920
There's the left and the right are the first and the second component.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.060
In order for this whole thing to be considered true both the left and the right have to be true.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.380
So in this example A and B aren't actually defined.

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.820
This is just a shorthand.

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.960
But whatever goes here it could be less than 5 and X greater than 20.

19
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.860
Both things would have to be true.

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.700
Obviously that's impossible.

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.850
But you know maybe it could be is name equal to Charlie and last name equal to brown then print whatever.

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.530
You're a Good Man Charlie Brown.

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.120
So let's try it out here.

24
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.540
It's the example we'll use is of movie tickets you're going to a theater at least in the U.S..

25
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.440
Infants usually get in for free up until let's say up until two years and then from two until 10 years

26
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.900
old there's a child price ticket.

27
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.480
So let's say that we want to write a conditional that checks if somebody age is between two and eight.

28
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.570
So we could do that you know we know how to do things.

29
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.290
Well first let's make a variable called Age and we'll set it equal to six.

30
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.990
And we know how to do you know is age greater than two.

31
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.790
That gives us true and we also could do is age less than eight.

32
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.830
That's also true.

33
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.140
And you know those could be greater than or equal to less than or equal to.

34
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.550
If you want to include two and 8 but to chain them together we can do this.

35
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:29.720
So would you age greater than two and age less than eight.

36
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.340
Now what do we expect to happen.

37
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.340
Remember both sides have to be true.

38
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.400
This part is true.

39
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.630
We already saw this part is true.

40
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.010
So the whole thing is true.

41
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.230
However if one of these was not true.

42
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.840
So let's say age now instead of being greater than to be greater than six.

43
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.120
They lost that and less than eight.

44
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.440
Remember that age is currently 6.

45
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.580
So six is not greater than 6.

46
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.730
This is false.

47
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.050
Which makes the whole thing false it spoils the entire pie.

48
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.370
As you can see.

49
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.260
OK.

50
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.820
So that's.

51
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.780
And and we could use that to do something like you know put that in the statement.

52
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.950
Let's do that now.

53
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.410
I'll recall the last line and we'll just add it really quick.

54
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.200
If age is greater than two and age is less than eight will do print.

55
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.200
You pay child price.

56
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.670
Not quite English.

57
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.350
But there we go.

58
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.200
Hit enter and because ages 6 it triggers.

59
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.970
You pay child price.

60
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.020
OK.

61
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.790
Next off Rader will talk about is or so or is similar in that there's a left and right side an A and

62
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.550
B but only one has to be true for the whole thing to be considered true.

63
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.070
So let me show you an example of that.

64
00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.540
And to do this all make a little demo let's do touch or dot p y.

65
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.400
OK.

66
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.670
And in this file I'm just going to ask for input first.

67
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.080
So I'm going to say city equals input.

68
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.870
Where do you live.

69
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.620
And we're going to check if a person lives in California so if they say they live in San Francisco or

70
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.100
they live in Los Angeles then we're going to print.

71
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.270
You live in California so we could check easily.

72
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.610
Is City equal to Los Angeles and I'm not going to worry about capitalization.

73
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.060
I mean assume everything is lowercase and we can also check easily.

74
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.560
Is City equal to San Francisco.

75
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.060
And what we want to do is write a single statement that just says if City is Los Angeles or city is

76
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.370
San Francisco that's at an F Now if that's the case will say print.

77
00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.940
You live in California and then let's add an else that just says print.

78
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.090
You live somewhere else.

79
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.550
Now of course this doesn't account for all the thousands of other cities in California but it's just

80
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.720
a simple example.

81
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.320
So again only one side has to be true.

82
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.450
Let's test it out.

83
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.000
So we're going to run Python 3 if I can spell it.

84
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.980
Or dot p y.

85
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.260
Where do you live.

86
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.670
Let's type but do New York first.

87
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.460
You live somewhere else.

88
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.050
Great but now to San Francisco.

89
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.200
And what did I do.

90
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.400
I spell it wrong over here.

91
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.710
Oh my gosh.

92
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.330
Well that undermines my entire video.

93
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.630
Let's try that again.

94
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.670
Now we can do San Francisco and it says You live in California.

95
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.970
I can do the same thing but say Los Angeles.

96
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.380
And it says You live in California.

97
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.960
So that's.

98
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.030
Or only one side has to be true for the whole thing to be considered true.

99
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:07.330
So just a quick example with numbers we could do something silly like one is less than three or one

100
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.880
equals ninety nine.

101
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.660
What does is value it to.

102
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.650
Well one is less than three That's true.

103
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.260
So we already know the entire thing is considered true because there's an or two it doesn't matter what's

104
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.410
on the right side but just you know for practice the right side is completely wrong.

105
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.200
One is not equal to 99.

106
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.600
So this side is false.

107
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.720
This side is true.

108
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.320
True or false because the or one side only needs to be truth.

109
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.860
So the whole thing is true.

110
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.390
All right.

111
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.880
So this video grew a bit with some of the examples.

112
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.900
I'm going to end it here and put logical not in it's own video right after this.

113
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.730
So we covered and and or hopefully you're clear on what the difference between the two is.

114
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.690
If not we'll get a lot more practice with them.

115
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.040
OK.

116
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.990
See you in the next video.
