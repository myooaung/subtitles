00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.140
Hello and welcome back to another video and this section on file I know we've seen so far how to read

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.100
from files.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.830
Now let's talk about writing to files.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.250
So first thing you should know when we're talking about writing to files we still have to open the file.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.830
So whether the file exists already or not.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.870
We'll talk about both.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.700
You still have to use the open function.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.560
So we open and then read or we open and then right we need to specify the W flag as the second argument.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.710
So we haven't been passing in any flags because the default is R which means read.

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.020
So if we don't pass anything in like we did in the last couple of videos we're reading we add a W as

11
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.500
a string to specify We are writing.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.930
So here's our first simple example and I'll just copy this over to my sublime.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.960
Here we are.

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160
So we have our same with open blue.

15
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.130
Stop it.

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.580
So we have the same with statement.

17
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.240
We're opening haiku XTi which is a file I have here it's empty at the moment and we're in the same directory.

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.810
Otherwise I need to do slash.

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.130
I don't know whatever the folder name.

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.810
And we pass in W.

21
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.990
So once again we've been doing this so far because we've only been reading W is how we specify We want

22
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.230
to write and we just use as give it the name file and then to write to the file.

23
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.520
We use the right method pass in a string and we'll add that file.

24
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.300
Notice that I also have the newline characters in there just so that we're writing two separate lines.

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.780
I'll go ahead and say this go to my terminal and run the file which I called right that p y OK.

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.590
So it looks like nothing happened.

27
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
But if I now open up that same haiku that textfile.

28
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.180
There we go look at what's been added in there.

29
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.870
OK so I won't go through the entire alternate syntax but remember we can do a separate variable.

30
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.980
File equals open Haikui that Trixy.

31
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I just copied that and then do file right and not do the with.

32
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.350
But then remember we need to do a file that close at the end as well.

33
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.520
OK now let's add to the file.

34
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.830
A lot of different Hi-Q.

35
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.120
OK I updated it.

36
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.570
Here's one more haiku.

37
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.750
What about the older one.

38
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.260
Let's go check it out.

39
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.680
Ominous sounding.

40
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.420
So we're trying to add to that file.

41
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640
This is here now.

42
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.240
Let's go ahead and rerun my file.

43
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.570
Now if I go to haiku that T.

44
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.610
I don't know if you're able to see that happen very quick but it reloaded the file changed and there's

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.700
only three lines in here.

46
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.500
So we didn't add on to the end and preserve what used to be in the file.

47
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.550
All that we did was basically overwrite everything.

48
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.660
So the original haiku is gone and we replaced it with these three lines.

49
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.340
So really important to know that that's how right behaves.

50
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.160
At least when we're working with the WFIU whenever we write to the file the original contents are overwritten.

51
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.860
Before I dive into the different file modes I'll also just highlight that we don't have to have an existing

52
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.160
file to write to.

53
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.070
So let's make let's change this instead of haiku down to 60 or maybe we'll do this on a separate line.

54
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:13.000
Keep the Hi-Q and just do EHLO well that XTi and then we'll write a single line in here that says Ha

55
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.290
ha and then multiply it by 10000.

56
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.120
OK.

57
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.290
Just like this.

58
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.580
And that file is not created elsewhere about 260 and see all the files I have in this directory.

59
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.370
There is not another well that takes me if I rerun that file.

60
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.690
And if I type of us can see there's now an L O L that t s t file.

61
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.250
So if I open it up every go filled it's completely full of ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

62
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.810
OK.

63
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.930
So the whole point there is just to show you you can write to an existing file or you can write to a

64
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.500
non-interesting file and it will be created for you.
