1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,590
OK.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,670
So this section is all about the Internet.

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,480
We're not going to be making websites or doing any web development necessarily but we're going to write

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,170
Python code that talks to Web sites that gets data from API eyes and build simple applications using

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,210
API data.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,910
And the way that it will work is that we'll use a package that allows us to make HTP requests.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,330
So pretty exciting stuff.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,700
You know we're continuing on with the theme of taking Python and using an external package to do something

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,610
more interesting whether it's printing ASCII art or changing the color of our terminal or getting data

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,350
from a Web site.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,870
So the way this section will be structured is this video is going to be a crash course on HGP and how

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,010
the Internet works.

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,960
So if you've never done web development or you're unfamiliar with how the Internet works and what a

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,160
request and a response is what an IP address is what a get versus post request is if you have any questions

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,680
about those things he just said watch this video.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,220
But if you've worked with you know in javascript or a node or in C or some other language and you're

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,800
familiar with making requests and receiving responses you can move on to the next video where I'll actually

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,960
show you how to make a request using Python.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,080
So two paths.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,630
Pick the one that's best for you.

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,140
All right.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,530
So let's begin this crash course on HTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,450
So where do we begin.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,830
Well there's a lot to talk about our objectives here are to describe what happens when you type a you

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,310
are l into a U R L bar.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,720
You hit enter a lot of stuff happens behind the scenes before we actually get our result.

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,970
So if I you know I go to Google dot com or let's say I search for Idaho salmon there's a lot of stuff

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,110
behind the scenes happening for me to see this page here.

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,500
So we'll discuss that.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,090
We want to describe the request response cycle.

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,950
Explain what a request or response header is and give some examples.

33
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,730
Explain the different categories of response codes and compare get and post requests.

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,460
So I should preface all of this by saying you are not going to leave this video being an expert but

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,710
you should know enough to understand what's happening when we write Python code that communicates with

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,320
API and Web sites.

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,430
But if this stuff interests you I highly recommend you check out Web development with Python or just

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,130
web development in general.

39
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,570
All right let's begin.

40
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,080
So the Internet stupid meme.

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,140
You see the Internet.

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,770
It's like this series of tubes.

43
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,710
Very very funny.

44
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,290
When you hear you know the Internet a series of tubes.

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,350
It's definitely kind of a joke at this point.

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,950
But the sentiment behind it is true.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,300
It's just a bunch of computers.

48
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,120
The Internet is just a bunch of computers that are connected.

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
I can talk to one another.

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
So I think people overplay this.

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,160
You know Internet is a series of tubes joke but it is true at its core the sentiment behind it.

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,160
The internet is a bunch of computers that are all in a network connected by tubes whether it's you know

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,550
a fiber optic cable or other wires or cables connecting the computers or there's some wireless Internet

54
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,480
in between.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,290
Eventually everything comes down to tubes or cables or wires or whatever you want to call them.

56
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,790
And data being transferred.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,140
So speaking of data being transferred when I go to you know open up chrome and I type google.com and

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,750
I hit enter Let's walk through what happens.

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,660
The very first thing that happens is called DNS lookup.

60
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,210
And the next slide will go over that in more detail but Google the outcome is not.

61
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,630
It's not a real thing.

62
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:32,540
Well it is a thing but as far as my computer is concerned it needs to send a request to a particular

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,610
IP address.

64
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,870
So the first step is called DNS look up.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,440
It takes google.com and it actually finds the correct address to send a request to then my computer

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,840
makes a request an AGP request to a server saying hello server at Google.com called is looking for the

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,500
home page of google.com.

68
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,880
Can you give it to me.

69
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,530
Then the server receives that request and says oh OK this person is looking for Google dot com.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,030
Did they search for something.

71
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,890
No they just want the regular home page.

72
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,440
All right.

73
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,630
Send them the homepage.

74
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,700
And then the server does just that.

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,770
It compiles the home page for me and sends it back.

76
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,350
So the last three things here is called the request response cycle.

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,530
The computer sends a request to a server whether it's your Facebook your Twitter.

78
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,120
I don't know Google any Web site read it.

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,580
Most the time for me to send a request.

80
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,630
And then the server sends something back to us.

81
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,360
And what's important is you know when I searched for Sam in here the exact same process happened I the

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,640
DNS lookup happened it figured out how it you know googled outcome's IP address and then the server

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,820
received my request.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,990
But this time my computer or my request said hey please give me the page with Sam and results.

85
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,260
And so the server had to process that request go find all of the salmon result in the giant Google database

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,840
and build me a different web page than if I had just looked for the home page but notice you know it's

87
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,960
the same place I'm sending it to Google dot com is the same first base you Arel same domain.

88
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,890
It's just that there's all this extra stuff afterwards and that translates to a different HGP request.

89
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,330
So we'll see more about that.

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
But let's start with the DNS lookup.

91
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,190
So it's like a phone book for the Internet phone book you know takes people's names.

92
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,170
It's been a long time since I've seen one but takes people's names and connects them to phone numbers.

93
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,940
This takes domain names you or else like google.com and turns it into an IP address.

94
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,220
This is what we actually send a request to at the end of the day.

95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,250
This is just a little human friendly layer.

96
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,460
Facebook's com after we try an ad for a hit enter.

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,390
I go to Facebook dot com a hit enter before requests can be sent off.

98
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,930
We have to know where to send it.

99
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,670
So this might be Facebook's IP address.

100
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,410
Same thing with Amazon.

101
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,990
There are these unique IP addresses.

102
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,290
So let's let's hone in on this request response cycle.

103
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,040
So my computer which is often called the client or anyone's computer who is initiating a request I send

104
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,350
a request and there are different types of request.

105
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,630
This is called a get request.

106
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,330
We will have a site on that too.

107
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,120
But let's just focus on the IP address.

108
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,790
So this is me sending requests to that IP address and that server process is the request and it does

109
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,750
something maybe it talks to a database.

110
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,150
If I'm going to Facebook.

111
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,760
Facebook needs to go to database and it needs to you know pull out all my photos and friends and assemble

112
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,880
my news feed and then send it back to me.

113
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,920
One thing we haven't talked about is how it sends it back what the format is anytime we view a web page

114
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,080
it's an HMO but also talk about that when we talk about API eyes.

115
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,740
OK.

116
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,570
So we we send a get request we'll talk to what we get means and then the server assuming everything

117
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,220
is fine.

118
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,870
Sends me the page I'm looking for but you've probably seen web pages you know you try and access a page

119
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,280
and you get a 404 error.

120
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,730
It says Page Not Found.

121
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,900
Or maybe you could get an error that says Page is moved or you know you don't have permission for bidin.

122
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,970
There's these different status codes.

123
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,810
So 200.

124
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,120
You probably don't see often because you get a web page and 200 means.

125
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,510
OK so there's no reason to display a message to say OK.

126
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,940
Unlike you know if you get a 404.

127
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,780
Usually there's a four or four page to tell you something went wrong.

128
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:29,810
But anyway the server respond to the response respond to the response it sends back an HD Pierpont containing

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
information.

130
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:37,340
You know a web page but always a status code to explain how the request was received if it was OK or

131
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,620
if you asked for page you don't have permission to view or if that page doesn't exist.

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,830
So the last step the server sends something back in that response which is called the response body.

133
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,440
And this is HMO.

134
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,250
So we're not going to talk about him out other than the fact that it is what is sent back to your client

135
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,870
and rendered in your browser.

136
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:04,220
So if I hit enter again I'm searching for Sam and I'm going to go to View developer view source this

137
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,510
as soon as it loads.

138
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,930
This is the time all this massive thing that is sent back from Google server.

139
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,660
So this is what is sent across the tubes in between my computer and Google server.

140
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:21,200
This is part of the response and all of it comes to my browser and the job of my browser is to turn

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,160
it into this.

142
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,660
So every little word you see here every time it says Sam and every photo is all enclosed or contained

143
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,730
in this aged him somewhere and it looks like a mess because it is a mess and this is not made for humans

144
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,950
to really read.

145
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,070
It's made for computers to read this is made for humans to read as a side note by open command option

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,270
J in Chrome.

147
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,180
There is a network tab and this shows me HTP requests that come and go.

148
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,370
And if I make a new request by just hitting enter here or let me just go to Google dot com the main

149
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,680
homepage watch down here.

150
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,680
A lot of stuff happens if I scroll up and I click on this one here Google dot com.

151
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,490
You'll actually will see a status for 200.

152
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,830
It was a get request sent to Google dot com and then we could see that we got a response back.

153
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,210
And this is our response.

154
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,000
This is the page we're seeing right now.

155
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,020
So this is just a little developer tool to help people like us who are trying to understand what happened.

156
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,280
What's interesting is actually the very first time I sent it I got a three to one moved permanently.

157
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:34,100
And then I was redirected to three or seven Internet redirect to this URL and that's because I just

158
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,980
went to Google dot com not www.youtube.com.

159
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,030
And so that happens behind the scenes I'm automatically redirected to WDW to Google about COM.

160
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,550
But I do remember a time when I was a kid where you had to type that GWW anyways getting side tracked.

161
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,510
All I want to show.

162
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,800
We sent a request we get back a response it technically looks like this.

163
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,490
Our browser makes it look like this.

164
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,910
Next topic.

165
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:07,010
Those requests and responses contain HDP headers so headers are sort of like meta data about the request

166
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,160
and they're sent with both requests and responses and they just provide additional information about

167
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,810
the requester response.

168
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:21,770
So the most important thing when I send a request to Google is the I'm and I'm asking for am I asking

169
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,270
for Google that com the home page or I'm asking for Google or com slash you know salmon or whatever

170
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,620
it is am I looking for Google dot com slash news cetera.

171
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,800
And that's important.

172
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:41,080
But there's also other information that I'm sending along like accept and accept is is my computer's

173
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,330
way of saying these are the types of responses that we will accept back.

174
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,500
So there are different formats of data.

175
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,280
Tim Ellis the one we see in our browser but there are other formats.

176
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,730
We'll talk about briefly including Jason and XM.

177
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:01,090
So for now I'll just leave it at this but this is a way of saying I will accept X formats back.

178
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,130
There's this other thing called Cash control.

179
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,570
Just another example of a header.

180
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,840
It specifies how the caching should behave.

181
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,620
There's something called User-Agent which contains information about the software used to make the request.

182
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,520
So if we actually look at this request here someone I sent to Google dot com.

183
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,930
Here are the headers.

184
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,890
These are all different headers so there's the request.

185
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,640
You know there's the request method and then in the response there are also other type of headers you

186
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,120
might get and I'm not going to go into detail here.

187
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,950
I just want to put these here to show you that there is information metadata sent in a request.

188
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,780
And then also sent back in a response.

189
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,670
But the most important part of a response that we've already talked about are the status codes.

190
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,800
So every request we send gets a response and those responses if they start with it too.

191
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,680
So there are these three digit numbers if they started that two it means it was a success if it started

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,300
with the three.

193
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,620
It means it was a redirect which we already saw.

194
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:03,200
We got to 3 007 redirect when I tried to go to Google dot com with the W W and if it starts the four

195
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,280
it means it's a problem on our end but we could try and generate one by going to google.com slash Hello

196
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,700
slash called slash cat and there we go.

197
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,410
We see the HTL page that says 404.

198
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,810
But if I look at the request and then I go to the response well not the response body for the headers.

199
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,400
There we go.

200
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,760
You can see status code is 404.

201
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,840
So 4:4 is the most common for error meaning not found.

202
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,540
There's also five hundred satis code which means something went wrong on the server side meaning that

203
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,200
it's not your fault.

204
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,910
Something happened on the back end somewhere on Google's end which pretty pretty much would never see

205
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,610
from Google these days because that would be disastrous.

206
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:42,970
OK.

207
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,320
So this video is getting long.

208
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm going to end it here.

209
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,670
This is part one of that crash course on HTP requests.

210
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,920
The next thing we have to talk about is get and post request and the differences between them and then

211
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,950
also what the heck an API is.

212
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,090
So we'll talk about that.

213
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,440
So to quickly summarize I go to you are a hit enter first thing that happens that you are well it's

214
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,440
turned into an IP address using DNA in the DNS look up process.

215
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,910
Then my computer the client makes a request to that IP address with additional information.

216
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,050
So it's not just the you are all that I'm looking for if I'm looking for Slash samen or slash.

217
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,200
I don't know Toona but it's also who is sending the request what type of data.

218
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,650
All except back and a bunch of other things.

219
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,160
Then the server processes it and says oh he's looking for the and Page.

220
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,860
Let's build him the second page.

221
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,630
He wants him out OK I'll give it to him NHT M-L sends it back to me.

222
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,410
Gives me a status code along with it that says everything is good or the page you looked for doesn't

223
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,190
exist.

224
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,640
Something like that.

225
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,390
And then my page my chrome window or whatever browser I have it might be my phone could be my laptop

226
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,730
will display the resulting HMO.

227
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,940
He gets back from the response.

228
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,440
OK.
