00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.450
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.910
In this video we're going to learn our first bit of Python syntax.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.840
Very simple.

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.010
It's called the print function but also we're going to see how to execute python files which is really

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.790
the focus.

6
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.270
We just need to have something to put in those files.

7
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.670
And for now it's just going to be print.

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.270
So I think it would be best if you follow along or you try to follow along with what I'm going to do

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.170
because you need to make sure that these steps work on your machine.

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.090
In order for you to have a good time through the rest of the course we'll be doing this all the time.

11
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.740
So what we're going to do is make a new file and I'm going to make it just on my desktop.

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.900
You have a lot of options for how you do that.

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.590
You could do it through Power Shell.

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.250
If you watch that section there are commands that we can do using the power show you could do it through

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.410
sublime which is what I'm going to do.

16
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
So I've open sublime and I'm going to go control and to make a new file.

17
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.200
And let's just save this one as first.

18
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.760
Why are first app.

19
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.480
Why.

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.000
OK.

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.930
App is it.

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.290
Let's go with first program APIs too generous of a name.

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030
First program dot p y.

24
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.600
And on the desktop.

25
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.990
So make sure you're putting it on your desktop because we're going to need to navigate to that desktop

26
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.770
in power shell to actually execute it.

27
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.090
OK so I'm going to save it.

28
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.240
They're not going to put it in a folder just right on the desktop safe.

29
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.130
P-wave very important.

30
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.110
And let's just start by typing your name in quotes or hello in quotes.

31
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.910
And you should get some syntax highlighting where instead of quotes it turns a certain color depending

32
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.330
on the color scheme you have set up.

33
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.340
You can change that here and will save control pass or fail save.

34
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.520
So now for the actual part of executing this code we just need to open up power shell to search for

35
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.480
and we need to navigate to that file.

36
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.670
So this is why I included that whole command line section.

37
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.930
If you are unfamiliar with the command center I'm going to show just go back and watch some of the videos.

38
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.020
You don't have to watch everything but focus on LS PWT and CD.

39
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.870
So I type.

40
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.320
LS And by default remember I open up in my home directory which is my username Colt and I can see here

41
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.920
is my desktop so I need to move to my desktop CD desktop use tab for autocomplete or type.

42
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.260
LS My file is here.

43
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.940
First program dot p y.

44
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.460
So now I need to run this and before I showed you just type in command just typing Python and hitting

45
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.880
enter opens up the REPL I'll quit out of there.

46
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.720
We're going to execute this file though because that Python REPL is great for trying things out just

47
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.590
to see how something works or for educational purposes.

48
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.430
But when we actually write code it's going to be in a file like this to run this.

49
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.780
Let me just clear.

50
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.630
I'm going to run Python the same command space.

51
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.280
The name of the file and I'll just use auto complete with tab.

52
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.160
Python first programmed.

53
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.870
Why and I'm going to hit enter.

54
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.490
There's Python code in there.

55
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.610
But nothing happens but that's a good sign because that means that it branded as Python and didn't encounter

56
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.810
any problems.

57
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.440
For example if I went in here and then tried to type something like this jibberish it's not in quotes.

58
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.110
And I'd typed I saved the file control us and I go back I'll use the up arrow to recall that line.

59
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.830
I try and run it.

60
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.710
Now I get this error message name error which is not defined.

61
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.120
It doesn't know what I'm talking about.

62
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.520
So it is a good sign that we didn't encounter any errors in the first time we ran the file but to actually

63
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.910
output something so we see something printed out.

64
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.520
We need to use our first bit of Python code which is the print function.

65
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.610
So we type print P R I N T with opening closing parentheses no space afterwards just like this.

66
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.370
And whatever we put inside of here I'll just cut that out and paste it in.

67
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.090
That is what will be printed out.

68
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.250
So feel free to change the message.

69
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.400
Just going to save that file.

70
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.580
So make sure you save a lot of times people who are new to coding forget to save.

71
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.050
Then we go and run it.

72
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.950
Oh I do recall that same line Python the name of the file and now it prints out Hello.

73
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.720
Whereas previously we had that the text here is called the string.

74
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.860
We'll focus on that in just one or two sections from now.

75
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.930
It was running it as Python code but it wasn't doing anything.

76
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.600
It was like whispering Hello into the dark and it just disappeared into the infinite abyss of Python.

77
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.400
Now we're printing it out so that we can see it and that's all that will cover about print.

78
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.500
For now it's just a function that prints something out to your Power Shell or to your standard out is

79
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.230
what it's called.

80
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.770
Whatever context you're running Python and it will be printed in.

81
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.740
So if somebody's on a Mac ran the same code they downloaded your exact file you made on your PC.

82
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.960
They run it on their Mac.

83
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.910
The same thing happens except it doesn't print out in power show it prints out in the Mac terminal.

84
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.410
OK.

85
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.380
So to wrap that up.

86
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.560
Just make sure that you're comfortable enough writing a new file so whether it's File menu or control

87
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.250
and sublime putting a single line like a print function call inside of it and then navigating to it

88
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.400
using Power Shell and executing it.

89
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.530
And if you're not and I recommend you go back and just watch the videos on cd ls and PWT in the command

90
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.550
bind section.

91
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.550
I know it's not that fun and you want to get to Python but we need to be able to run our python files.

92
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.070
Ok I'll shut up now.

93
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.460
Next you have the world's simplest exercise in the utility coding exercise platform.

94
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.510
It's by far the easiest one you'll have.

95
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.520
All you have to do is print your name on a single line and it's not really about testing your knowledge

96
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.620
it's just to make sure that you're comfortable using the platform.

97
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.430
Type your code and hit submit.

98
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.390
And if you write print and you do it correctly you should see something good.

99
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.520
If you don't it will ask you or tell you there's an error.

100
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.600
So that's next.
