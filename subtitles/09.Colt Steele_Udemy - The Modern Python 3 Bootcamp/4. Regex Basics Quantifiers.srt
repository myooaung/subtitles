1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,430
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,690
The next batch of rejects syntax will look at are called quantifiers.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,550
These little characters that you see here all help specify how many times something should occur in

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,600
a pattern one or more or exactly 10 times or zero or once that sort of thing.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,590
We make things you know we work with other characters and we manipulate how many times they need to

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,400
be there using quantifiers.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,190
So right now what I have back over here I'm just going to change this just a little bit to add in another

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,860
word and you'll see why in a second it will just make our example clearer.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,310
I did in kittens anywhere in here.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:37,790
OK.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,800
So let's say I wanted to match any word that starts with a K and then has anything afterwards.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,510
So I don't want to just match a single K.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,470
I want to match the pattern of a K starting a word.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,840
So if I just type K so a single out you know three K's that i have i like there's a K kittens and Kitty

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:06,330
but I only want to match things that start with a K and then what comes next a word character.

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,550
So I could do it like this K and then any word character afterwards.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,010
And you can see it's matching k d k i k I.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,470
But if I want any number of word characters afterwards I add a plus sign there.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,850
It's now going to match something that has a K and then whoops it just changed it and the number of

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,830
word characters after.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,540
So we're getting kittens.

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,490
We're getting kitty but there's a small problem which is we're still getting this k e that comes at

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,550
the end.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,610
We'll see how to fix this later on where we can specify something that needs to start with K.

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,520
But with what we know right now I could just do a whitespace character like that whitespace character

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,370
then.

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,260
And then a word afterwards.

28
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,500
It stills mentioning that space in front of it.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,790
For now that's good enough.

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,200
We get a whitespace character.

31
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,060
OK.

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,140
It is only lowercase case right now if I change it to uppercase it doesn't match anymore followed by

33
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,460
at least one word character afterwards.

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,520
OK so that's plus one or more but we can also specify something exactly a number of times using curly

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,740
braces.

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,830
So earlier when I was trying to match things that were five letters long I was doing slash w slash w

37
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,200
backslash in at c one two three four five.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,970
I could also just replace this as such w square or curly braces five.

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,490
And now it only matches things that are five characters long one two three four or five.

40
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,170
It's hard to see here because it's going one two three four five and then one two three four five and

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,240
then one two three for five and then it doesn't get that F I kind of wish it was a little easier to

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,810
see where things you know where the actual matches were just bunds them all together.

43
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,160
But this is getting 5 word characters in a row I can change that to be nine.

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,670
And it's only going to match that right there.

45
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,470
So this is useful already.

46
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,630
Let's say I had a phone number in here so I don't right now but let's do much redo.

47
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:13,770
Let's just add some numbers in here 3 1 0 4 6 7 always 3 digits isn't it.

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,740
And then there we go.

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,920
OK.

50
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,460
And let's say that I want to dash.

51
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,410
This is the syntax that we're going to follow.

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:30,320
If I wanted to match any phone number say I add one more and do it this line I'll change the area code

53
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,010
and just change a couple of digits.

54
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,710
OK.

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,630
I want to match that pattern three digits space three digits dash 4 digits using what we know already

56
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,110
I can do.

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,250
This is a digit a single digit.

58
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,210
And I want three of them at the beginning.

59
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,170
And then I went to space and then I want what is it three digits again.

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,980
So already that's matching only the two numbers the phone numbers.

61
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,210
Then I want a hyphen and then I want four digits ups like that.

62
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,110
And now we're only matching the phone numbers.

63
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:16,030
So instead of having to do you know slash d over and over and keep repeating it we can take advantage

64
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,100
of the curly braces if we also wanted to have a range of times.

65
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,610
Something could occur.

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:31,450
Let's say I want all I don't know strings of word characters that are between eight and 10 characters

67
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,880
long or let's go between 5 and 7.

68
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,500
I would just do sashed w for a word character five not five on its own matches only five letters but

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,520
five comma seven gives the characters or words things that contain word characters that are between

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,730
five and seven letters long or the includes numbers 2 and word characters but none of these are five

71
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,560
or seven letters long if I added a number in there.

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,830
It's now being matched because it's at least five.

73
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,710
And if we just wanted to do greater then you know four or more times you just add a comma in there.

74
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:17,350
So if I want to match all series of numbers digits that occur four or more times I can do for a comma.

75
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,500
We don't have any longer.

76
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,460
Let's do three commas so you can see it now matches three in a row as well as five in a row here and

77
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,570
four in a row there.

78
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,160
But it doesn't match two in a row.

79
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,970
We also have a star which means zero or more times.

80
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,690
So this is going to be a silly example but let's focus on this giant string of flutters some I repeated.

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:47,610
If I did a and then B star C see what it matches is there has to be an A.

82
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,160
And then there has to be a C afterwards.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:58,430
But then any number of B's between zero B's three B's You know if I change this to be 1 b it still matches

84
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:06,710
if I get rid of it it still matches and if I go back to how it was multiple B's it still works.

85
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,920
So that is the star.

86
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,100
It means zero or more I could do the same thing with C and then put a D afterwards.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,430
And it's going to make sure there's an A in A D on either end and in between any number of BS or CS

88
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,390
including zero.

89
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,960
And then finally there's the question mark which means once or none versus the star which is zero or

90
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,500
more.

91
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,090
This is 0 or 1.

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,700
So it's an example let's see I'm going to edit this just slightly.

93
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,910
I like cats and kittens and down here I mean to change the email to be kitten at gmail dot com.

94
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,650
OK.

95
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:51,050
And if I write you know kitten like this it matches part of kittens and then kitten but if I do s questionmark

96
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,000
it now matches both of them the full word because it says you know I'm looking exactly for Kitten K

97
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,190
I T N and then 0 or 1 s.

98
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,320
So it wouldn't work if we you know we had two s's.

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
It can only occur once.

100
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,230
So one more example that might be a bit more realistic if I have I was going to copy the same phone

101
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:20,180
number but instead of a dash or a hyphen I'm going to get rid of that if I want to still match this

102
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,940
as a phone number.

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:29,660
And these other ones I would have three digits then a space and then have another three digits and a

104
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,390
dash and then Opus are missing the digit character and then four.

105
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,170
Right.

106
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,130
OK so that matches these two.

107
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,580
Oh I forgot I added extra digits there earlier on.

108
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,410
But we're not matching this one because it doesn't have that dash.

109
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:54,500
So if I just add a question mark it now matches because that dash is considered optional but it wouldn't

110
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,940
match.

111
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,150
If we had you know two dashes there you can see no longer counts.

112
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,180
So that's a question mark will do.

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,540
That's what all of these things do.

114
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,670
They quantify the number of times that characters or patterns need to appear.
