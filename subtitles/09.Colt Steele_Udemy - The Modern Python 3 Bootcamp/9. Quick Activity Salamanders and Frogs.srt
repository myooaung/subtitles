1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,820
So it's time for a super quick activity.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,600
Just take a couple seconds of your time maybe a minute depending on how fast you type.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:13,820
All going to have you do is use some of the commands you've already learned and follow a couple of instructions.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,850
So somewhere on your computer doesn't matter if you're using a PC.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,970
Cloud 9 Mac.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,120
It doesn't matter if it's on your desktop or your home directory.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,460
You make a new directory just somewhere make a new folder called animals and then instead of animals

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,460
make to further new folders one called salamanders and one called FROGS.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,610
Then inside of the salamanders directory make a new file not a folder but a new file called axolotl

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,460
that takes the really cool animal tell you more about them if you're curious.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,240
After you do the exercise and then instead of the frogs directory add a new file and you know I've typed

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,240
this whole thing out.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,670
Just type Pixi frog that TXI.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,930
So two files each in a different directory.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,830
And those two directories are instead of the animals directory.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,490
So quickly do that I should mention from the command line.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,750
Don't cheat and use your mouse do it from the command line and then afterwards all have a quick solution.

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,380
But then also some really fun facts about Aksel models and Pixie frogs if you care.

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,310
They're pretty cool.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,150
OK.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,800
So let's go ahead and do this.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,830
I'm going to work on my desktop.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,590
So the first thing I'm going to do is CD to my desktop and then from in here I'm going to make a new

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,390
directory called animals.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,710
M k d i r so I could CD into animals so you can see it peered over here.

27
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:43,560
By the way or if I wanted to I could make directory's from here I could do make directory animals slash

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,540
salamanders and that's totally valid.

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:59,460
So I could do that or I could CD into animals make directory salamanders salamanders space frogs and

30
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,540
do it in one line.

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Those are the two directories you needed.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:12,690
And if I type LS I now have two directories so I could touch this file axolotl but XTi from inside the

33
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:20,210
Salamander directory or I could do touch salamanders slash Axel Ladell.

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,520
Correctly correctly XTi.

35
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,570
And if I type LS I won't see anything but if I C.D into salamanders and now type Alice I have axolotl

36
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,840
itx.

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:41,680
And then for the frog I'll just C.D into frogs and do it this way and I'll make that pixie frog that

38
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:49,650
DXi I want do the entire Latin name Pixi frog XTi and that's it.

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:57,720
So we have that file there CD back out let's do ls frogs and salamanders.

40
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,150
Great.

41
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,890
OK.

42
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,200
So I mention I have a couple of fun facts axolotl.

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,770
Aside from having a crazy name have a really adorable smile.

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,180
You can see here they're from Mexico.

45
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,720
They were once worshipped by the Aztecs.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,380
They have a crazy ability to regenerate not just like typical frogs amphibians you can chop them off

47
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,290
or something that their spinal cord can actually regrow entirely can cut it in half or remove a section

48
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,540
of the spinal cord and they can heal their a thousand times more resistant to cancer than any other

49
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,200
animal on earth that we know about.

50
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,450
And they glow in the dark and pretty cool animals.

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,650
They're just so cute.

52
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,140
And on the flipside Pixie frogs.

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,990
So my sister growing up really wanted one of be.

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,160
She is a special sister and we went to the pet store.

55
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,950
They had one.

56
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,320
She really wanted one till she found out you had to feed it live baby mice a couple of times a month.

57
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,030
So we did not go home with a pixie frog.

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,470
But I think it's kind of hilarious that it's called pixie frog and it looks like this.

59
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,420
Anyway they distracted you from the mundane reality of the command line but we're almost a python.
