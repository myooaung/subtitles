00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,070
Another company use case of decorator's is to enforce certain restrictions on arguments.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,750
For example I could make a decorator that prevented a function from being called with any keyword arguments

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,820
or I could prevent a function from being called with any numerical arguments or something like that.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,370
Let's let's go with the first one.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:27,420
So I want to I want to make something called I don't know and sure no quarks and then whatever function

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,530
I define afterwards when I execute it the decorated function.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,750
If I pass in keyword arguments instead of just plain arguments then it should raise an error or it should

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,950
return early or something like that.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,670
And to do this it's pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:50,310
First thing you should do is just define our decorator so def ensure no quires takes function.

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:58,410
Let's say you are boilerplate wraps Fannie-Freddie imported that and then define our wrapper whatever

12
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,900
you want to call that with args and quires and then all we really want to do is just check if there

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,680
are any quires then what what to do it's up to us.

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,440
But for now we can just raise an error or we can print.

15
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,680
Let's raise I think a value error would be best.

16
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,440
We could create our own exception if we inherit from the base exception but let's just do this and just

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,240
say no core is allowed.

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:41,520
Sorry not a very professional error message and then Otherwise we'll just a simple return F.A. and we

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,870
need to just pass in args and quarks and then finally return proper and we should be good.

20
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,040
Let's test it out down here.

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:59,310
So let's just define a really simple function called Let's go with greet and greet just takes a name

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,130
and then all we're going to do is print enough string.

23
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,510
Hi there and then.

24
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,480
Name OK and in front of it.

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,670
Well put in sure no quarks.

26
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,560
So now when I call greet if I do something like greet Tony that should work fine.

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,300
Let's also use this as a check for any syntax errors.

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,800
Lord knows I probably have one.

29
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,510
Nope it worked.

30
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,880
Of course the one time and then if I tried to do instead.

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,150
Name equals Tony.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,450
Using a keyword argument.

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,490
Perfect.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,970
We hit the value error so we now have come up with a way of ensuring no keyword arguments with this

35
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,770
decorator so we could use the same idea to ensure you know a certain type for all arguments to ensure

36
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,740
that certain arguments exist.

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,040
There's there's different things that we can do and actually show you another example in the next video

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,830
where we can ensure that the first argument is something.

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,110
But we're going to make a dynamic decorator one that we can actually pass something into.

40
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,650
So we could say ensure first arg and then I could pass in.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,300
I don't know what would be the first.

42
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,150
The first arg is burrito or something.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,550
So that's coming up next.

44
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,410
But for now we have to find another decorator that helps us just ensure there is no keyword arguments

45
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,660
in a given function.
