00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,820
Oh right we've made it through some of the tougher stuff in this section I'm looking at you.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,800
Class methods.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,650
That was a toughie.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,610
And this quick video should be a nice breath of fresh air.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,710
So it's all about a little magical method a Dunner method just like Annette called repr I think it stands

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,670
for either.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,310
Why no sense for either represent or representation or potentially representative.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,410
But I think it's representation what it does is it allows us to define a representation of an instance.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,410
So in this case in this case human that when we print or turn a human into a string we can control what

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,210
it looks like.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,660
So currently in our User class I'm working in a new file called repr.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,050
Why if I just print Tom which is a user you've already seen this before we get this hideous looking

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,980
thing.

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,620
So with repr we can control.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,940
We can return a string.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:58,200
And that is what will actually be printed out so we can define it up top with all the other donder methods

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,850
I can get double underscore heart EPR.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,020
It's an instance method so well yourself.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,840
And for a user we could just return something simple like first name so self-taught first when you add

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:21,630
those brackets and then maybe an age just to do self that age just like that doesn't really matter.

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,410
But now this is important.

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,330
When I print a user we get Tom is 89 which maybe is not the best representation but hopefully you can

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,670
see how this can be useful but doesn't really unlock anything new but it just makes development easier

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,730
because we can come up with custom representations that when we print something that it also when we

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,320
turn the thing to a string which print is doing behind the scenes.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,990
Let's say I make a new user called J.

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,640
ECOs user.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,870
And let's not use from String class method.

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,830
Let's do user names.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:05,320
JUDY STEEL is my mom and I don't want to say our age who get upset let's say she's 18.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,830
Now if I print J will get the same thing but if I did J equals the string version of J.

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,380
And now I print J.

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,080
We'll also get the same thing.

34
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,690
And this just shows that when you print something Reppert is called and then return to me into a string

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,820
repr is called Behind the scenes as well.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,940
So this repr method is not only something we define on our own.

37
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,660
For example take a list or a dictionary.

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,850
Those things when we get them printed out we get this little representation of them.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,510
But remember there are actually instances of a class of the last class or the dictionary class and by

40
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,780
default they would look something like this.

41
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,230
But because of this a little bit of magic Python calls it's going to look for a way of turning it into

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,210
a readable format first and then printing that up.

43
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,870
OK.

44
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,260
So just so you know this is something you can do double underscore R E P R R.
