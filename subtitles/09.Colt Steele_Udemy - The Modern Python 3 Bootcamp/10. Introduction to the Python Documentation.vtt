00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.530
Hey I have a really quick video here on the Python documentation.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.190
So we've already been to the python site to install Python.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.100
But if you ever have questions or you want to learn more about something I'm showing you.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.980
You can go back to Python dot org.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.700
Go to documentation.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.300
And then I want to just point out that need to be very careful to use Python 3 docs not Python too and

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.880
click there.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.540
And will take you to the latest version if for some reason you are using a different version like 3.5.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.950
You can change a peer.

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.640
Just make sure you don't go back to two and you can follow a great tutorial if you have some basic questions.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.760
But if you have a question about something like let's say one of the built in functions like print free

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.170
fine print over here you can just do a search as well.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.680
This will give you details about how print works.

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.710
So it tells you how to use it.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.570
This is probably going to be a bit overboard for what we know at this point but there are a lot of options

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.930
and things that we can do with print that we haven't discussed but that's all I really want to say.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.050
If you ever have questions you can come to the docs do a search and you know this is one portion on

18
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.200
built in functions.

19
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.610
There is stuff on every part of the language.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.950
So if you have a question it can be answered on here or will be.

21
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.470
It's just a matter of finding it.

22
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.310
Also if you do google things like let's say you have a question about Python strings and you Google

23
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.770
it.

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.210
A lot of times the top results are using the two point seven or 2.2 something documentation because

25
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.260
they've been around longer.

26
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.150
More people have clicked on them because it's been around longer.

27
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170
So they're are often indexed higher.

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850
Just be conscious of that.

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.250
Usually Python 3 docs are right behind.

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.150
So just make sure you click the right one because it can be confusing if you go and you read something

31
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.350
that is no longer true.

32
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.880
The syntax is changed.

33
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.080
So just be careful with that said.

34
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.640
You don't need to go out and read the docs start to finish at this point if you'd like.

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.330
I highly recommend that beginner tutorial but in this course I will point out the docs and show you

36
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.140
the things that I think are most useful.

37
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.600
As we progress.

38
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.990
All right.
