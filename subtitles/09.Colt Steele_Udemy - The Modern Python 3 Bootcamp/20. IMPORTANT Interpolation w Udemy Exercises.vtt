00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.370
Either I have a really quick important announcement about the exercises.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.560
So I'm a big fan of using strings and pretty much everyone is who's using Python 3.6 or later.

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.560
However currently the to me coding challenges only supports Python 3.5 so strings are not supported

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.620
in these exercises which is really frustrating because it doesn't reflect what people are actually using

5
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.580
in Python.

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.550
I've written in multiple emails about this and I've been assured that it's in the works but I have no

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.080
guarantee of when that will happen.

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.700
So it doesn't really make a difference for anything else in this course except for when you're using

9
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.570
an empty string.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.460
So instead of using strings if you are in an exercise use the dot format method.

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.860
Here's an example exercise I made up.

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.890
I won't be giving away the solution of a real one.

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.310
Here's just a demo.

14
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.350
We have two variables.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.910
Fruit and ripeness.

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.160
And I want to print out a sentence that looks like you know the fruits is ripeness the banana is unripe.

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.400
So I want to join them with an is and they want a.

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.670
The at the beginning if I tried to use an F string so I had to print F and this and that.

19
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.150
And then here I would say the fruit is.

20
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.460
And then afterwards ripeness.

21
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.130
And unfortunately this will not work if I copy this over to my terminal and hit enter.

22
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.280
It does work.

23
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.360
So it is valid code but as you can see this is three point six.

24
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.830
Back in the exercise if I try it and then check my solution takes a moment invalid syntax line for it

25
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.800
does not like my syntax here.

26
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.690
So it is invalid and 3.5 was nothing until 3.6 instead rather than this we're going to print.

27
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.620
I'll leave both of them here.

28
00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.260
Get rid of that f and get rid of these variables that are inter-related and we do a duck format and

29
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.410
we pass them in the order that we want them to be inserted.

30
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.720
So fruit comma ripeness.

31
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.590
I think this is a much worse syntax which the Python team agreed which is why they added the string

32
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.370
syntax.

33
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.910
But you'll have to use this unfortunately in the exercises.

34
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.030
It's at the end of the world.

35
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.030
I mean people use Format all the time.

36
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.810
It's just not my personal preference.

37
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.950
And hopefully I'll be able to take this video down soon.

38
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.780
Once you give me updates the exercise is the platform anyway.

39
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.030
If I try this now.

40
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.510
Perfect.

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.040
Well done.

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.410
Your solution is correct.

43
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.750
OK.

44
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.510
So that's it.

45
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.530
Just keep in mind in the exercises if you are trying to interpret a variable into a string you need

46
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.620
to use that format.

47
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.840
If you're submitting them and trying to get the tests to run otherwise if you're doing it on your own

48
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.410
computer just use an F string or whatever you'd like.
