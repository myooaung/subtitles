1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,670
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,290
So as the side says this is the Mac installation instructions.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,200
So if you have a Mac watch this video if you don't have a Mac but you're curious you could watch this

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,040
video too.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,570
But ideally find the video that suited to your platform whether you're on a PC or using Cloud 9 or Mac.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,700
So it's really simple actually.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,210
Unlike a lot of the things that I've had to teach people to install before Python is pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,360
If you visit GWW Python dot org slash downloads or just google Python or Python download the first link

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,060
that comes up will take you to Python dot org and just click on the downloads tab.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,740
So here is python dot org.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,290
Click on download it will detect that you're on a Mac and then you want to make sure zoomin you want

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,900
to make sure you're using Python 3 point something not the Python 2 version.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,010
And these numbers will likely have changed by the time you're watching this but there will still be

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,940
a Python 2 x 3 x we want the three.

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,270
So click on this.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,210
It will take a moment to download and then we're going to run that package once it's done downloading.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,650
All right so we just go through the steps continue continue.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,350
Make sure you read this entire agreement continue again.

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,500
Yes I read it.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,740
I agree to all those terms and then install.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,920
OK.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,340
So now you need to enter your password or thumbprint or whatever sort of an occasion you have on your

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,590
computer and it will take a little bit a fast forward through this and we should get something like

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,720
this installation was successful.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,840
Nice green checkmark very satisfying.

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,470
We click close and we can move the installer to the trash and that's it super easy.

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,720
So then the question becomes how do we know that it worked.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,800
The first thing I should say is that you'll need to open a new terminal window to notice any changes.

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:02,610
So open a new window or quit your terminal restart it and you should now be able to type python 3 like

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,620
this and hit enter and not get an error message.

31
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,070
Now that three is important.

32
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,680
So I'm going to first of all I guess I can explain what this says very briefly.

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,280
This is the interactive python shell REPL basically stands for read evaluate print loop.

34
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,120
Essentially it's a place to type code in Python.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,650
You hit enter and you get a result.

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,650
It's mainly used for debugging purposes.

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,820
It's not where we actually write most of our code because as soon as we close this window it disappears.

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,930
So we get out of here.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,560
We can do control D.

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,010
But what I want to show you is that if we just type python on its own it actually opens up the same

41
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,520
thing.

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,790
But on my computer I have Python 2.7.

43
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,280
I believe that most Macs come with Python.

44
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,800
I want to say all of them do but I'm not positive if that's been the case throughout all of history

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,380
but this Mac came with a version of Python already installed.

46
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,070
So if you just type python it's referring to this python 2.7.

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,640
So we want to make sure we're using Python 3 eggs again with control D.

48
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,510
So we want Python 3 and you can also do dash dash version and you want to make sure that you have three

49
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,430
point something.

50
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,460
OK.

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,700
So that's pretty much it.

52
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,200
On a Mac.

53
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,840
Super straightforward to install.
