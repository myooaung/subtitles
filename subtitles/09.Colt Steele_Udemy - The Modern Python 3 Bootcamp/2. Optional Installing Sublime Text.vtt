00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.400
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.580
And this video I'm just going to introduce you to Sublime Text.

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.180
So the editor we're going to use the place will be writing all of the code or most of our code in the

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.660
entire course is in Sublime Text.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520
It's a free text editor.

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.790
A really really powerful free tool.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.060
Most of the time when you get these free things they're either limited in what they can do unless you

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.470
pay to unlock it or they're kind of cheap and not well-maintained.

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800
Sublime is neither of those things.

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.030
It's constantly updated and maintained.

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.140
There's a really strong community behind it.

12
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.650
It's not some dinky piece of free software.

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.950
In fact if you Google this is very unscientific but if you Google you know best Python editor or a top

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.380
Python editor Mac you'll always find sublime first.

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.150
So to get started you go to Sublime Text dot com and click on download it will detect what platform

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.650
you're on and just click the download button.

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.770
So I already have it installed but it's really simple process just like any other application.

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.190
You download it and then you run it and drag it to your Applications folder and that's it.

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.890
So here's sublime.

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.710
I have it open now and all I want to do is give you a really quick tour of some of the features that

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.210
I'll be using.

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.420
First of all to make new files just like any other piece of software you can use shortcuts command and

23
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.940
to make a new file or you can go up to the menu file new file or you could use your terminal and type

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.270
touch new file.

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.300
But let's say that we want to make a new file it's untitled.

26
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.980
If I add some Python code in here which we're getting ahead of ourselves we haven't talked about Python

27
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920
really but one plus one.

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.410
Our first little line.

29
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.650
This right now it's not highlighted.

30
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.360
I don't have any autocomplete.

31
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.340
It's not a python file at all.

32
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.430
If you look down here I unfortunately can't make this larger.

33
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.790
But it says plain text.

34
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.240
But if I save the file I'll just save it in this folder called Python course and also save it as demo

35
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.140
that y.

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.950
Let's go with sublime demo.

37
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.840
Why.

38
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.190
That's the file type for python files.

39
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.120
And the hit save it immediately changes and it's now highlighting my syntax.

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.000
Also down here supply has detected that it's a python file.

41
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.960
There are tons of features to sublime that I'm not going to go over.

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.450
There are some great articles on you know the 30 best things you need to know about sublime the 50 shortcuts

43
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.590
you have to master.

44
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.200
There's really good writing about it.

45
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.080
Tons of blogs.

46
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.770
But I'll leave that up to you because some of my students I know are more comfortable with the all the

47
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.930
hunt and peck method finding you know menus rather than using shortcuts.

48
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.370
All right.

49
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.400
So as far as opening our files in subline that's going to be important.

50
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.470
Let's say that I've made a folder I have made a folder on the desktop and such a thing called Python

51
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.040
course and let's focus on the web scraping folder.

52
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.790
So there's all these files and folders in there if I want to open a single file like let's go open this

53
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.230
file right here.

54
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:04.650
Books to see a or a book scraper why I can just drag it over with my mouse and it opens up and I can

55
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.720
edit it and you can see this is full syntax highlighting for Python.

56
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.750
And so it's Python specific.

57
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.480
If I changed you know I put non Python code in here it would not be highlighted correctly.

58
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.950
Also there are things like auto complete.

59
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.850
So we haven't talked about any Python syntax I'm getting ahead of myself but if I type a word like DPF

60
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.360
and I hit tab that's a common phrase that we use in Python it auto completes for me and gives me some

61
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.140
extra code.

62
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.090
So look out for that as we go.

63
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.140
I'll introduce other.

64
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.560
You'll see me using tab and I'll point it out.

65
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.600
I'll type a couple of letters hit tab and something will happen.

66
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.700
We can also open entire directories.

67
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.360
So if I wanted the entire inclosing folder I can drag that over and it opens up a little sidebar for

68
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.720
me.

69
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.200
And now I can toggle between the history file and the python file.

70
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.650
Or I might have to put on files this is just an example something we do later but imagine you have all

71
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.610
your files for the course if you want them all open at once.

72
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.740
You could easily do that and just click on the file if you want to edit.

73
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.660
Also you can come up here too.

74
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.750
Where's that file.

75
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.270
No preferences.

76
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.830
There you go.

77
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.370
Subcontext preferences and then color scheme if you want to change.

78
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.970
There are a couple that come preinstalled.

79
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.730
You can also download more I'll stick with Monica for now because today I use an entire course to have

80
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.050
continuity there.

81
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.170
You can also download all sorts of packages that will help you do other things.

82
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.420
Another feature I like is if you go to View and you got to lay out you can decide if you want to file

83
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.680
side by side which often do you know have two files open and a look at one of them and type in the other

84
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.210
one.

85
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.370
So a lot of what we'll be doing is working across multiple files.

86
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.490
So that's another thing you can do in the very last thing and I want to point out I use a short cut

87
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.910
pretty often in this course called UBL.

88
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.260
And if you just install sublime you will not have this shortcut by default.

89
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.950
So let me just explain what it is first if I'm in a directory called Python course that I have for the

90
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.780
course and when to make a new directory just call that the sublime demo CD into that it's empty.

91
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.530
So what I could do is make a new file but say that I want to make a file called Hello dot P Why I could

92
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.280
do touch as we saw in the previous section on the command line.

93
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.050
That makes me the file and if I type LS it's there.

94
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.300
But now I have the problem of how do I open it in sublime.

95
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.760
So I could go back and hunt for it using finder.

96
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.900
I called that sublime demo.

97
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.710
Here it is.

98
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.930
And I can drag it in and now I have hollowed up why open here and I can add content and save it and

99
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.960
that's part of this with you is optional if you return to stock.

100
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.190
We're frustrated we're confused.

101
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.070
Please don't let it prevent you from moving on.

102
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.730
Please do it before you get good stock.

103
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.700
Skip it.

104
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.000
But I can also use this as UBL shortcut that I have installed as UBL sublime.

105
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.320
Load up Hawai and it opens it for me.

106
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.240
I can use that to make new files that don't exist so I could do a good buy.

107
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.760
Why.

108
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.840
And it opens a goodbye for me.

109
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.580
Before I talk about how you could install it just if you see me using this in the course all that it

110
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.640
does is open a file in sublime text so you could instead manually make a new file and save it with a

111
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.930
name you could use touch.

112
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.990
And then open it or you could use SBL if you have it installed.

113
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.830
So it's a really useful tool but there's a catch which is that it can be kind of a pain to install in

114
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.610
my bootcamp courses.

115
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.860
Everybody was on Macs and we'd have what 25 students.

116
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.190
I'd say at least five or six would hit a roadblock with this.

117
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.530
It was nothing that they did wrong.

118
00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.120
It was just in the past they had done something that caused problems that conflicted with what this

119
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.530
install wanted.

120
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.240
So I'll include this tutorial if you want to follow along.

121
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.370
All you have to do is run a couple of commands that explains it well you need to make sure that you

122
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.140
have subcontext 3 not 2 and that it's installed in the correct location.

123
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.750
Instead the Applications folder and if it is you should be able to just run one or two lines to create

124
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.310
this symlink instead of your terminal.

125
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.930
And this tutorial actually calls this the command sublime instead of UBL because they personally think

126
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.360
it's better to be more explicit like this.

127
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.760
But you can change it.

128
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.140
It's decided here.

129
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.750
So whatever you wrote here it's going to be the symlink name anyway.

130
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.100
So you can give this a shot.

131
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.620
But like I said it can be difficult.

132
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.970
Don't allow it to impede your progress through the rest of the course because it's not that hard just

133
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.770
to drag a file over to Sublime Text.

134
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.650
It's not bad.

135
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.490
This is just if you want to be you know streamlined and never leave your terminal.

136
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.540
Next we're going to write our first really simple python program and execute it.

137
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.060
So we need some time to do that.
