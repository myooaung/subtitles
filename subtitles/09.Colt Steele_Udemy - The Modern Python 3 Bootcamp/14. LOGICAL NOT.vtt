00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.000
Okeydokey.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.990
So next up we have our last logical operator which is called not.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.350
It's also known as logical negation and it's pretty simple compared to and and or because all that it

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.810
does it only works if the one logical or one piece of logic at a time and it will be truthy.

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.370
If the opposite of A is true which you know hearing yourself say that it sounds really confusing but

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.610
a simple example if we had a variable called is weekend this weekend is either true or false.

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.420
We can do it.

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.980
If not is WEEKEND we'll print go to work.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.810
Now that's a really really simple example.

10
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.340
Most of the time we actually use it to negate other pieces of logic.

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920
So let me just show you an example.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.270
First of all we could do something like.

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.060
So we have you know one is of less than let's make a variable and we'll call it age.

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.230
This time is 10.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.820
So we could have a statement like age is less than four and that's false.

16
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.310
But if I just do not age less than four it's true.

17
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.520
So it just flipped it turned to the other way around.

18
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.560
So that's a silly example.

19
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:23.160
But if we go to a file so I'll quit this and I'll make a new file called not p y and in here that's

20
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.740
just hard code age to start.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.500
And let's just say age is 21.

22
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.520
OK so we're doing our movie tickets again.

23
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.760
And so the age groups are going to be between if you are from two to six or two to eight.

24
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.010
It's a $2 ticket.

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:54.330
And if you're a senior citizen which is you're over 65 it is a I don't know maybe a five dollar ticket.

26
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.340
And for other people.

27
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.160
So basically the people who are not between two and eight and not six they're not 65 or greater they're

28
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.200
going to pay $10.

29
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.520
OK.

30
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.760
So if we wanted to just target the people who are going to pay $10 what we could do.

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.330
And you'll have to stick with me here.

32
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.730
We're going to start by just targeting the people who are between two and eight.

33
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:29.050
So that's going to be is age greater than or equal to two and it's age less than or equal to eight.

34
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.300
So that gives us our first group.

35
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.390
Then we also have OK is age greater than or equal to 65.

36
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.660
So these are you know for senior citizens this is for children.

37
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.400
So what we can do now and this is going to be a big step we're going to combine these two with an oar.

38
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.510
So this is growing out of control but we're going to add parentheses here to make it clear what happens

39
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.230
where.

40
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.730
OK.

41
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.300
So we have our first thing is to check is age between 2 and eight or is age greater than or equal to

42
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.930
65.

43
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.280
Right.

44
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.160
So if it's either one of those that means that it's either you know a child or a senior citizen.

45
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.670
So we can choose not to negate the entire thing.

46
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.570
So the we want the opposite of this to be true.

47
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.330
Now I realize this is a bit of a stretch but let's just walk through it again.

48
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:37.770
So we're basically saying if we are not if age is not between 2 and 8 and age is not greater than 65

49
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.540
and the reason that it's an end is because the not would negate this.

50
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.600
OK so let's plug something in let's say age is 21.

51
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.880
All right.

52
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.660
So 21 is not 21 is greater than or equal to two.

53
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.880
But it's not less than or equal to eight.

54
00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.740
So this becomes right here false that we have false or is age greater than or equal to 65.

55
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.340
That's also false over here.

56
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.410
So false or false.

57
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.700
That whole thing is false because we need one side to be true so it's false.

58
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:23.470
Not false turned it into true yeah I have a feeling that may have been a bit of a bit more than I should

59
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.770
have in this video but I'm going to leave it in here.

60
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.880
I'll do some simpler examples afterwards.

61
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.860
But let's just add an if at this point.

62
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.810
So Will do.

63
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:42.670
If that's the case we will print you pay $10 and are not a child or citizen or senior and are not a

64
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.030
child or senior.

65
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.120
OK.

66
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.410
Let's test it out.

67
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.030
So we're going to run Python 3 not p y.

68
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.700
And we get you paid $10 an hour not a child or senior but if we change this.

69
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.270
Now to be 7 rerun it we don't get anything so let's add or else

70
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.280
you are a child or senior.

71
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.950
Now one thing that you should probably consider is that it would be in most situations we might want

72
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.700
to just say we could restructure this in a much better way where we could do.

73
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.000
If you're a child you pay this else if you are a senior you play this.

74
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.590
Pay this else then you pay $10.

75
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.990
But for the sake of this example I did it this way.

76
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:43.050
So if we are seven we get you are a child or senior If we are 78 meaning we're senior we get you our

77
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.600
child or senior.

78
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.400
OK.

79
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.590
So I know that that was it.

80
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.910
That was a lot adding in these parentheses in particular.

81
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.050
But the idea is that not will negate whatever comes after it.

82
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.250
And because we have parentheses this is going to go first that turns into false.

83
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.720
So we then we have false

84
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.180
or age greater than 65.

85
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:15.860
Well in this case that's true because it's 78 so false or true becomes true and then we negate that

86
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.080
with not which turns the whole thing into false.

87
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.090
So if false This doesn't run so then else runs Yeah I know it's a lot.

88
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.250
OK so I'll leave it at this for now.

89
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.920
If you want we can do a couple of really quick examples.

90
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.360
You could do something like one less than two.

91
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.320
That's true.

92
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.370
But if we put not there not note not it's now false.

93
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:49.280
We could get slightly more complicated with not one greater than three and five equals equals five.

94
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.260
So what's the result of this.

95
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.330
Well it's one greater than three.

96
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.100
Nope.

97
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.280
So that's false false.

98
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.840
And it's five equal to five.

99
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.670
That's true so false and true that whole thing is false but we're negating it all making it true.

100
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.500
Yeah yeah I know it's it kind of feels crazy to be doing these sort of examples.

101
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.890
I know but hopefully you were able to follow along with this here.

102
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.200
I know it's pretty gross and ugly but this is what we do with the logical operators so that the idea

103
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:27.150
is that we're stringing together comparison's individual comparisons with Orr's ants and nuts.

104
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.030
OK.
