1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,110
OK so in this video I'm just going to introduce the less basic rock paper scissors version still is

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,350
you know pretty simple game to play.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,720
But now we actually have a computer player.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,200
So it starts off the same rock paper scissors or whatever title card you want and then instead of player

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,820
1 and your choice it just says enter your choice because there's only one computer or there's only one

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,650
player.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,880
So I entered paper and then the computer picked randomly scissors.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,820
So the computer beat me.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,350
So the AI which is a bit of a stretch to call it that the computer opponent just picks a random move

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,580
every time.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,660
Now the thing is we haven't learned how to do that.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,480
How do you pick a random anything.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,840
So I'll give you a hint if you want to try it on your own first.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,060
Otherwise I'll just show you in this video.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:57,360
Kind of a bonus thing but what you would research is something called Rande at random and it will generate

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,400
a number for you.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,670
So for rock paper scissors you basically need three numbers.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,360
You could generate 0 1 and 2 and just pick one of those randomly using Rand int and then you basically

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,840
have a conditional that says OK if if the random number was zero then the computer plays rock.

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,180
If the random number was one the computer plays paper and so on.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,560
So that's that's the easiest way to do that.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,810
The only other thing I need to say if you are going to venture and do this on your own Rand.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,830
It is not something that you can just use out of the box in Python.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,450
You actually need to import something.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,950
So Google it if you're going to try this on your own.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,800
It's not you know it's a single line that you have to add.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,300
So nothing crazy but it is out of the bounds of what we discussed.

28
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,460
But I encourage you to just check it out.

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,800
There's tons of stack overflow posts about generating random integers.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,990
You can find it in the Python documentation.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,550
I highly recommend that you do it.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,430
So here's a quick demo of how it works.

33
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,100
There's two Python three and I called mine.

34
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,260
Version 2.

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,170
So let's enter our choice.

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,710
We'll do paper and the computer played rock and it beat me.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,800
Let's do paper again.

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,320
And played rock again.

39
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,520
Oh my gosh computer's playing rock a lot.

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,910
There we go of course right when I'm trying to demonstrate that it is random.

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,710
We get three rocks in a row.

42
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,580
But finally the computer play paper and let's do one more.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,110
I need a valid move.

44
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,350
Now we're getting a lot of rocks.

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,930
And finally oh my gosh how many later like 15 attempts I finally got the computer to play scissors.

46
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,000
It truly is random.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,740
Well it's as random as computers can be.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,780
That's for a whole other discussion and course it's not true randomness.

49
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,280
But this is more just a freak thing that I couldn't get scissors to work.

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,080
OK.

51
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,060
The only other thing I'd mention about it is that I made it case insensitive.

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,980
So we haven't talked but how to do that either.

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,150
So if you want you could research that.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,490
But it allows me to play rock upper case upper case or in any capitalization that I could come up with

55
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,650
so I could do pay for like this.

56
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,440
And that works as well.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,460
So if you want you can try to add that on your own as well.

58
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,200
OK.

59
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,650
Next video will have a solution.
