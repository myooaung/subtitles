00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,260
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,990
We're almost there.

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,380
We just have to talk about how to make your own folders using the power show and also how to make files.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,650
And this video will cover directories.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,000
It's very straightforward.

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,170
It's the exact same command as Linux.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,070
M K D are short for make directory.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,750
So you just type make.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,220
DIR followed by the name of the new directory you want to make and it will make that directory as a

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,010
child of the current directory.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:36,110
For example if I'm currently in the stuff directory if I ran the command make dear cat pics that's the

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,670
name of the new folder.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,470
It's going to make a new child folder nested inside of stuff wherever I was when I ran that command.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,980
And you can see stuff is instead of code instead of users.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,180
And if I type CD cat pics I now have moved into that new directory I couldn't have done that earlier

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,860
because it didn't exist.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,480
Ok so I am in my home directory and my power show.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,700
Let's go to the desktop and if I look at the desktop there's only two folders right now.

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,220
I think it can show you that.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,570
There we go recycle bin that counted and then color code and stuff.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,260
So if I type M-K DJR I'm on the desktop.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,100
Let's make a new folder just called which we call it might not cat pics.

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:29,660
So the ATP I see as there does you see it showed up.

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,820
So this is Power Shell the command line is like a shortcut to main line into the artery of your computer.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,390
It's allowing us to directly interact with and change files and folders and so on.

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,760
This is another interface but it has a few more layers of abstraction to give you the graphical components.

27
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,400
This is the more direct but also a little uglier or a lot uglier version.

28
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,400
So if I type LS I now have this new cat pics directory and I can change into it.

29
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,160
CD cat pics so cat pics is empty if I type.

30
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,650
LS There's nothing in there I could try making another directory inside like I have one cat named Blue.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:16,040
So I make a directory called Blue CD into blue using tab complete and just to verify if I double clicked

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,670
on this.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,460
You can see there's now a blue directory that's empty.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,710
OK so that's all there is to making folders using M-K Diyar make dear.

35
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,180
So if you are partial to the graphical user interface and you want to just make your folders.

36
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,510
Actually don't even know the shortcut of think.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,360
What do you type this.

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,510
Yes that makes us a new folder so actually be interesting.

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,850
My other cat was named Well she doesn't have a name.

40
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,940
I've been calling her Kitty.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,410
I made a new folder if I type LS from inside of blue.

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,710
I don't see anything for CD Back out to cat pics.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,820
I now have a new folder.

44
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,860
So two ways of doing the same thing.

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,870
If you prefer.

46
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,640
There's nothing wrong with using this again.

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,230
All you need to be able to do is navigate using the command line to find a folder and find a file to

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,670
execute with Python.

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,460
So if you make that folder file with Python it doesn't matter to me.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,570
It's just.

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,810
I personally find it faster for me.

52
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,570
But as a beginner it definitely can be slower but the only way to get faster is to practice.

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,800
So I recommend doing it.

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,820
But if it's going to discourage you from taking the course or discourage you from working with Python

55
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,460
then absolutely do whatever you're most comfortable with.

56
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,650
To make the new folders and files in the next video will actually see how to make a new file.
