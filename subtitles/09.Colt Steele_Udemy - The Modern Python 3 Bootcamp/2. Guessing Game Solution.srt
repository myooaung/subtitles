1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,080
All right.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,480
So in this video we'll build a potential solution to the guessing game mini project.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,430
If you were able to get that without too much difficulty you may not want to watch the entire video.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,350
You could skip to the end and I do have some some notes on potential ways of structuring this that are

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,670
better than others.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,730
It's it's opinion but you may want to take a look or you can just look at my solution code.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,920
And if you struggled with it you may want to watch most of this video if not the whole thing.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,430
I'll walk through it step by step.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,410
Let's head over to the starter code and the first thing we have here the random number that the code

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,790
to generate the random numbers from 1 to 10.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,530
I won't go into much detail at all but basically it gives us a number from 1 to 10.

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,060
So let's just make sure of that.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,040
Let's try running this I get 7 10 and you can trust.

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,340
Oh there we go included one in 10 as well.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,560
So it is inclusive.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,320
Drives me insane ranges.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,930
Our exclusive rant is inclusive.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,900
I don't know why.

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,250
So now that we have a number picked.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,610
Really our logic that we need to happen is we need to check is that guess what we need to get a user

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,690
guess first.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,970
So that's going to be the easiest part will do.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:27,160
Guess equals input and then to say pick a number from 1 to 10 out of space.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,870
So it's a little easier for the user to tell.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,060
And after that our logic is really to check if they guessed correct.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,760
So if a random number and guess are the same or is guess less than random number we tell them to low.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,670
If gas is greater we'll tell them too high.

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,600
So just a simple conditional statement that we can add in.

29
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,160
So let's just do let's not even worry about the loop and getting things to repeat.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,300
Let's just start off with if guess equals equals the random number.

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,970
Exactly.

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,440
We'll print you've got it

33
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,500
elif.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:12,110
If gas is less than random number will print too low.

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,930
And finally we can just do an else because there's no other option.

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,290
We'll print too high.

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,960
So this should work one time through.

38
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,360
But there is a problem which you hopefully are getting more accustomed to this.

39
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,740
We have a type issue.

40
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,360
So if I run this he asked me to pick a number or type 3 and it says less then the operator is not supported

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,500
between strings and ints.

42
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,250
So this is still a string.

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,360
So I need to convert gas to an end so I'll just do it.

44
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:55,560
Guess And now let's actually at the end let's print what guess or excuse me random number is so we can

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,230
tell if our logic is correct.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,470
So I'm going to pick five and it tells me to high and the number was supposed to be 4.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,240
Let's do a pick one tells me to low.

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,900
It is supposed to be three and who knows.

49
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,820
Let's see if I can actually get one right.

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,500
Probably not but we'll trust that our logic works if I do guess correctly OK.

51
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,510
I won't waste time with that.

52
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,950
So we're getting too low correct and too high.

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,980
When are supposed to.

54
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,640
So now what we need to happen is we want to repeat this process.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,070
And when do we want to repeat it how long are we gonna repeat it.

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,540
We want to keep going Intel guess is equal to a random number.

57
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,060
So that's kind of itself to a wild whoop.

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,480
We could I guess you could use a for loop although it wouldn't really work because while technically

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,700
we could assume that a user only needs a maximum of 10 guesses so we could loop through with a for loop

60
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,890
10 times and then break out when they get it right.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,870
But that that I don't know a user could forget something or be distracted and guess the same number

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,420
multiple times in which case they would potentially make more than 10 guesses.

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,480
So a for loop is not the best option.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,340
Also with a for loop if we wanted to suddenly expand our game to go from 1 to 100 We would also have

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,120
to not only change the random number but change the for loop itself.

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,570
So a while loop is much better when we don't know how many times something will run.

67
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,370
While loop is always better.

68
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,130
So what we'll do is we'll run this while guess is not equal to random number.

69
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,560
We'll keep going and we can get rid of this.

70
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,960
And the first thing we'll do is while the guess is not equal to the random number we're going to ask

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,200
them for a new guess.

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,790
And we'll check if guess I mean and everything.

73
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:58,580
If guess is less than the random number or print to well you and Aliff guess is greater than random

74
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,010
number some switching things up just a little bit.

75
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,180
Well print too high and then we'll do an else and we'll print you one.

76
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,580
There is a problem here which maybe you have spotted which is the very first time we run this guess

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,020
is undefined.

78
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,320
So we move the code into the loop because we want to continually ask every time inside the loop for

79
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,800
a new guess but that leaves I copied it.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,640
Eric cut it out from up top.

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,540
So the first time guess doesn't exist.

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,150
It's going to try and compare something that doesn't exist to a random number.

83
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,570
So that's going to be a problem.

84
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,400
I'll show you the error we get we go invalid.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,460
No no that's not the same error.

86
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,190
That's because I forgot my lovely Colon's Rico.

87
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,680
Now we should get the error I'm expecting.

88
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,610
Here we go.

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,950
Guess it's not defined.

90
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,270
So what we could do is just start by setting guess you go to an empty string or something or two none.

91
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,470
And if I do it now.

92
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,850
Pick a number from 1 to 10.

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,230
Let's go with five to high.

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,920
OK.

95
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,750
1.

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,720
Oh I guessed it and you could see afterwards.

97
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,500
It tells us the the number was 1.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,010
We still have this print at the bottom.

99
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,290
Let's do one more.

100
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,810
Let's pick five again.

101
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,390
Got it right off the bat.

102
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,500
Five two high.

103
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,970
Let's go with one two low three.

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,110
I won.

105
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,100
Cool.

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
So that's the basics of the guessing game actually.

107
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:38,310
This is the simplest possible solution we could do where we repeating things and the game runs one time.

108
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,110
So as soon as we win it's over.

109
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,650
So the last thing I'll show is a version where the game keeps going.

110
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,520
It asks the user you want to keep playing.

111
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,180
And they type Y or and or yes or no or something like that.

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
So what I'll do is actually make a new file.

113
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:00,030
I'll just call it guessing V-2 and I'll duplicate my code over there.

114
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,230
But there's a couple of changes I'm going to make and the first thing I'm going to do is change is actually

115
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,210
quite a bit.

116
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,330
I mean do a while true so this will loop forever.

117
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,860
But then what we'll do is in this else here where the user won or where they win the game it won't break

118
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,840
out of the loop dead.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,700
But I'm going to ask the user.

120
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,550
So let's call it a variable called Play again.

121
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,540
Equals input.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,720
And what am I doing as a string input.

123
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,370
Do you want to play again.

124
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,230
And then we'll do.

125
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:42,560
This is kind of standard to see in terminal y slash n and they just type Y or and hit enter and then

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,280
we'll just add a conditional if.

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,650
Play it again.

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,100
Don't need those parentheses although they won't hurt if it equals Y.

129
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,720
If that's the case what are we going to do.

130
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,750
We're going to generate a new number.

131
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,690
So this line right here OK.

132
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,340
And we'll set user I guess or in our case guess to be numb again.

133
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,890
Otherwise that means eight types and or anything else.

134
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,760
Technically what will we do.

135
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,820
We're going to quit so we can print.

136
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,020
Thank you for playing

137
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,000
and then break and that's it.

138
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,600
So let's see if it works.

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,970
Q They included all the cones would be needed this time for if and or else.

140
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,440
OK let's see what happens.

141
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:47,450
Python 3 guessing V-2 Oh I thought I'd check for those Colon's this is.

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,770
That's pretty bad.

143
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,000
I apologize.

144
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,000
OK let's try that again.

145
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,110
OK.

146
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,120
So pick the number let's go five again.

147
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,640
It says I won right away.

148
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,900
I want to play again.

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,140
Yes.

150
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,710
Picks another number list five again this time on to low.

151
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,960
About nine to high.

152
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,740
Eight to seven.

153
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,180
So it must be 6.

154
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,320
And I won.

155
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,350
Do I want to play again one more time.

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,650
Pick number from 1 to 10.

157
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,550
One two three four five six seven and I won.

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
This time I'm done playing.

159
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,090
And I'm out.

160
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,200
Cool.

161
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,760
So one small change we could make.

162
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,160
We no longer have to initialize guests appear because our while loop is not depending on guests anymore

163
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:41,370
like it was over here because this is just a while true it keeps going forever until it hits this break.

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,540
So the difference is that this is going to play as many games as the user wants.

165
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,770
This one plays one game so it loops through until they get it right.

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,270
This one loops forever until we quit and that's it for our guessing game.

167
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,790
So next up we're going to take our rock paper scissors game and make it I think a lot better.

168
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,780
Similar idea.

169
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,810
We're going to make the game repeat and we'll actually have a winner and a loser.

170
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,860
We'll keep score.

171
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,430
You'll be able to play against the computer rather than just playing one time and having it end.

172
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,030
He'll be able to know who gets two out of three or who wins the first five or whatever it is.

173
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,340
So it's a lot better in my opinion.

174
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,950
So that's coming up next.
