1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,570
OK.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,730
So we've seen how to find out where we are but we haven't learned how to move or change that.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,650
So in this video we're going to learn that command CD which stands for change directory.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,420
It's how we navigate through our files and folders.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,940
So we have a couple of options when working with CD.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,450
We can use an absolute path.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,400
So in this case let's say that I inserted the stuff directory.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,940
So if I typed PWT I would see slashy users slash code slash stuff.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,420
And if I wanted to move to the users directory from stuff I could use the absolute path to find users

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,000
so that is slash users and I write CD space and then the path slash users.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:51,670
And if I hit enter and then I use PWT it will now show me I'm in slash users.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,820
So this is again known as navigating.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,840
Absolutely.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,040
So this is useful but I'm also going to show you another way of navigating in just a moment.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,720
But before we do that let's take a look.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,730
So here we go to my other window or type PWT again can see I'm in a folder called Top Secret.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,810
Let's say I want it to navigate to my home directory which is called Steel.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:22,900
Well I can do cd space and then the absolute path slash users slash cold steel.

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,830
Now if I type PWT I can also see my prompt has changed here.

20
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:34,950
I'm in my home directory so I can also do the same thing actually to go to my root directory.

21
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,800
I could do cd slash.

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,760
And now if I type PWT I'm in slash and you can also see the prompt changed.

23
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,330
And if you want to go back to my desktop Let's say I could do cd slash users slash.

24
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,580
And I'm going to show you.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,220
You can use tab to auto complete.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:04,730
So if you want to type the whole thing slash desktop and now type PWT and I'm on sosh users slash called

27
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,210
Steel slash desktop so that's using CD change directory.

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,460
Absolutely.

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,320
But we have another option which is to use it relatively.

30
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,410
So this is what I end up doing most of the time.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,360
It allows you to change directories based off of where you currently are.

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,730
So there's a special alias dot dot and that stands for the parent directory or one directory back one

33
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,960
level up from where you are.

34
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,450
So for example if I am currently in the stuff directory and I type PWT I see slash users slash Colt

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:47,060
slice slash stuff and if I wanted to change back one level to the home directory to code I can just

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,100
do cd space dot dot and that's the equivalent of saying Take me back one level.

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:59,280
And in this case is the equivalent of if I did it absolutely it would be CD slash users slash code.

38
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,630
But dot dot is so much shorter.

39
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,590
So now for type PWT I see him in slash users slash cost.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
So let's do a quick demo of that.

41
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,250
First I'm going to show you there's a clear command.

42
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,190
This just not functionally it doesn't do anything it's not important but I use a lot just to clean up

43
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,750
my terminal and these videos.

44
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,660
So I'm currently on the desktop.

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,990
Let me make a new window

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,500
and by default I'm in the home directory.

47
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,250
So if I type PWT I get slashy users slash colp.

48
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,460
So if I wanted to navigate to the users directory I could do it absolutely of course CD slash users

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:45,400
or I could make use of dot dot because that is the parent of where I am and if I do that and I had PWT

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,420
now I'm now instead of slash users.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,880
So right now we're all missing how to navigate backwards using dot dot but we'll see in a bit how we

52
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,430
can also navigate down into the subdirectories.

53
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,520
Unfortunately right now we don't have a way of seeing what's in this user's directory so we don't know

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,450
what folders we can change into.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,150
But again just to quickly wrap this up if I go back.

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:21,280
So let's navigate to my home directory again which is I could do cd slash users slash cold steel and

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,100
R-Type PWT can see SAS users slash cold steel and wrap this up.

58
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,540
I'll just show that you can use dot dot more than once.

59
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,390
So if I wanted to go to my root directory I could just CD slash.

60
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,130
That would actually be shorter but it could also do C.D dot dot.

61
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,510
That will take me to users as you can see there.

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,770
And then I can do Siddiqa one more time and that takes me to the root directory.

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,930
So in this video we saw two different ways of using CD.

64
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,660
You can use the entire absolute path or you can navigate relatively using things like dot dot.

65
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,490
Now in the next video we're going to continue working with CD.

66
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,000
We're going to introduce a new command LS That allows us to look around to see what files are in a given

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,480
directory.
