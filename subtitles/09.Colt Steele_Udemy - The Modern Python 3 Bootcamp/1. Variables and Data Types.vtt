00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.770
All right.

2
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.640
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.260
It's me again.

4
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.080
Colts Yep same guy just stuck in this room recording alone talking to myself.

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.390
So we were talking about variables and data types in this section.

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.510
If you program before you've probably come across these topics because they are not unique to Python

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050
but if you haven't they might sound like gibberish.

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.660
Don't worry we're going to go over all of it in this section.

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.850
So at the bottom I have a note that says mostly strings for now because when I say data types there's

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.800
really just going to be a quick video where I introduce data types and then mainly focus on one particular

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.240
type called the string and we'll revisit other data types as we go through the course.

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.990
All right.

13
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.640
So let's talk about our objectives.

14
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.220
There's kind of a lot for the section.

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.820
So if you're one of those people who just doesn't care then.

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.400
Go ahead skip to the next video.

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.000
But what we're covering the first thing is we don't understand how to assign and use variables.

18
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.920
So along with that what is a variable How do you sign it.

19
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.790
How do we use it.

20
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.560
Recall them we want to learn Python variable naming restrictions and conventions.

21
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.470
So what are the things you're not allowed to name variables and then also what are the things that you're

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.190
allowed to.

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.840
But you're kind of not supposed to because it's bad style then we're going to learn some of the different

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.450
data types available in Python.

25
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.980
So a quick overview.

26
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.310
We're going to learn why Python is called a dynamically typed language.

27
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.980
Then we'll focus on converting data types.

28
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.380
So if we have something of an integer for example how do we convert it to a float or the other way around

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550
or what if for working with text and we want to convert that to a number.

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.710
Is that possible.

31
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.640
We're going to learn the ins and outs of strings.

32
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
So we're going to spend a couple of videos at the end of the section working with strings which is a

33
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.020
data type to hold words or text basically.

34
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.250
And then finally we'll build a silly little program that actually gets user input.

35
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.280
So it's can ask the user in the command line for now to supply some information that will take that

36
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.300
information and do something with it.

37
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.510
So to set your expectations it's not going to be revolutionary but it's a big step to have some interactivity

38
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.660
and some dynamic elements to our programs.

39
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.090
So right now all of our code does the same thing every time we run it multiplies two primes to and print

40
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.070
the answer out.

41
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.930
But now we can multiply two times three or four or five depending on what that user says.

42
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.600
So pretty exciting stuff.

43
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.490
But actually it is really important.

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.790
So that's really what we're covering in this section.

45
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.470
We're going to talk about variable's first up and then we're going to shift a bit to strings which we

46
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.360
use as a data type for variables but we'll get to all that.

47
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.230
So let's get started.
