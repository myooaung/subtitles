00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.320
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.620
So this video has nothing to do with Python.

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.470
We will get there eventually but this is just about sequel.

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.520
The basic syntax to create a table then we'll learn how to insert and select and then we'll move over

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.250
to Python just to get everyone on the same page.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.530
So if we already know sequel then this probably is not going to be that exciting.

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.050
So this video in particular is focused on creating tables the sequel 3 data types that we get.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.340
And actually if you do no sequel from LIKE MY as well or postscripts the data types are different.

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.420
So I would at least check out that part and I'm going to start by just giving you a quick tour of sequel.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.900
So I'm going to go to my show and as we've seen we can do just sequel 3.

11
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.560
It may just be sequel lite depending on how you set up in your path what you added on a PC.

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.660
But either one try that you'll know which one works and you'll see the prompt changes and the first

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990
thing I'll show you can type help.

14
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.400
And this gives us a bunch of commands.

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.940
Most of these have to do with like maintaining and sort of dealing with databases.

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.640
These all these commands that start with a dot are actually creating or adding to a database or interacting

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850
with databases using sequel.

18
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.750
These are like meta functions essentially commands that you can do one of them that will come back to

19
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.450
you as Dot tables.

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.690
This will tell us if we have any tables in our database and we currently don't.

21
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.520
So that's what we're going to work on and this video is how do we create a new table.

22
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.660
So if you're not familiar with sequel at all or databases The idea is that we stored data in these different

23
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.480
tables so like a book's table or a user's table and each table has different columns so that we could

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.430
have four books an author and a quantity in stock price and some of those are going to be numeric.

25
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.180
Some of them are text and that's what we'll start with here.

26
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.240
And the documentation for sequel like sort of austere but includes under overview documents.

27
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.780
Nope no programming interfaces data types.

28
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.910
So I'm looking for.

29
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.220
So these data types there's really five.

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.090
Actually it's more like four.

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.200
If we don't include no four different types that we could use for each individual column.

32
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.540
So if you wanted to use a number for example we have two choices an integer which is a whole number

33
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.160
or a real which is a float or in other languages a double.

34
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.650
So if you want a decimal point you need a real like a price if you need a whole number.

35
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.180
Use an integer like if you're doing quantity or age or something.

36
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.370
Unless of course you want to store age with fractions anyway.

37
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.520
Then you would use a real.

38
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.170
Then there's this last one which is a bit weird called blob.

39
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.380
Essentially if you make something type of blob whatever you put in there will be stored exactly as it

40
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.790
is.

41
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.000
So there will be no effort to change it into an integer or into text or something like that.

42
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.490
We're not going to really focus on blob in this video or in this section because it's so short.

43
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.880
It's not a sequel course but as a note there is no Boolean data type in sequel.

44
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.990
Use a number 0 or 1 integers.

45
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.070
There's no date or time either.

46
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.300
So a lot of more powerful databases do include that here.

47
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.450
You just have to store data on your own as text or possibly as boolean or if boolean as a real different

48
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.110
options.

49
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.580
OK.

50
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.230
With that out of the way now let's talk about how we define a table.

51
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.650
So the syntax to make a table is pretty straightforward.

52
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.790
It's basic sequel.

53
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.570
So I have a new file I'm going to type my code in just so that you can see as I'm typing it and then

54
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.040
I'll start by copy and pasting it over to my shell.

55
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.860
So if I'm going to make a new table I need to start with create table.

56
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.350
Now technically you don't have to capitalize it but that the convention when you're doing a sequel commands

57
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.540
the commands are actually capitalized and then any of your data is not.

58
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.050
So create table.

59
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.540
What do we want a color table.

60
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.020
Let's say that I'm just doing something silly I'm storing dogs.

61
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.280
So usually it's pluralized create table dogs and each dog will just have a name a breed and an age something

62
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.810
like that.

63
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.810
Now in parentheses we pass in a list a comma separated list of the different columns who won.

64
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.130
So I like to do this on separate lines like this and let's say the first one is name which will be text.

65
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.090
We really only have a couple of choices Greta will also be text and then age will do a whole number

66
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.650
so that will be integer just like that.

67
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.890
And then we need a semi-colon at the end if any sequence statement.

68
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.930
So come back over here and paste it in and hit enter and it doesn't look like anything happened.

69
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.820
We don't get any messages but if I now type tables again you'll see OK.

70
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.570
We now have a dogs table.

71
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.740
And if I did this again but instead of dogs I created a second table called cats and do tables again.

72
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.870
Now we have two tables.

73
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.560
There are similar different names but the same data are the same columns at least inside of them and

74
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.380
they're totally empty.

75
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.150
So they just it's like a spot for us to insert our data.

76
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.090
Now here's the thing that I do want to address now if I quit with control D and I reopen sequel line

77
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.250
and I do not tables or pressures tables are gone totally lost.

78
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.080
Notice how it says connected to a transient in-memory database.

79
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.210
So it is not going to persist once I quit out of here.

80
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.570
We need to save it basically to a file and we have two options to do this.

81
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.450
I can do a dot open once I'm inside of sequel.

82
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:37.350
Open filename so open and let's say I want my database to be let's do dog D-B dot DB That's the file

83
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.540
type.

84
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.840
Now if I run my create table again I can remember that.

85
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:51.330
Here we go OK and we do tables and I quit now if I do an ls you'll see there's a new file here.

86
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.360
I never actually created that file myself.

87
00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.990
I said open this file which siecle light takes to mean open or create this file and then save all of

88
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.860
our data to that.

89
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.840
So when I said create table dogs it went into this database file.

90
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:14.730
So now if I want to open it back up I can do a sequel lite dog D.B and sequel like three dog D-B And

91
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.410
now do tables.

92
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.020
And there we go.

93
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.840
We have the dogs table.

94
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.480
Now the other thing that we can do is do a sequel like three and then a database file that doesn't exist

95
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.290
like cat D-B dot D-B doesn't exist yet.

96
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:38.050
But now if I create the cat table like that I do tables we have a cat's table I quit.

97
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:45.360
There is now a cat's file or cats DP file and I can open it again sequel like three cats and do tables

98
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.030
and my data is still there.

99
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.810
So the point is there's two different ways of doing it but either way we want to save or data to a file

100
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.420
if we don't it's gone as soon as we close out the database.

101
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.230
OK.

102
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.610
So we saw just the very very basics of making a table we haven't put anything in there yet.

103
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.740
So that's coming up next.
