00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.610
So next up we're going to learn a command called the LS.

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.310
Stands for list and it allows us to list the contents what's inside of a given directory.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.850
So right now we're kind of blindly fumbling around.

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.120
We're using Pido udy to see where we currently are and we can see the backwards or to a particular place

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.190
that we know exactly the absolute path but we don't have a way of viewing the files that are available

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.020
for us to CD into.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.050
So tell us again just stands for the list and on its own it's just going to list the content of the

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.480
current directory.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.960
So let me show you right now here I have a new terminal window.

11
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.360
If you can see I'll just do PWT as well.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360
I'm inside of my home directory.

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.400
Now I can type LS here and it lists all the folders that are inside of my home directory.

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.530
So what you see will probably be a little bit different.

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.650
Some of them might be the same depending on the platform you're on your OS and so on.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.080
Now let's try going back one level.

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.490
See the dot dot.

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.320
Quick quiz.

19
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.160
Where will that take me

20
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.320
if you get users.

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.170
Good job.

22
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.310
So we're in slash users.

23
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.480
If I type LS Now you can see there's a couple of users here.

24
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.940
And let's go back one more time.

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.190
Now I am in my root directory a tape ls and I can see a bunch of different things that are here.

26
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.380
So hopefully you can see that navigating now is a lot easier because if I want to go I don't know into

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.740
users or into applications I know that they exist they don't have to just blindly guess.

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:39.660
So I can do things like let's go back to users cold steal type LS And let's go to the desktop CD desktop.

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.280
Notice by the way that I'm not having to type the whole absolute path I can just say CD desktop rather

30
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.990
than CD slash user slash cold steel slash desktop because I'm already in users slash cold steel.

31
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.810
OK.

32
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.110
So from the desktop LS You can see I have a couple of directories I've created cat photos confidential

33
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.650
my stuff nuclear codes and top secret.

34
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.860
One thing I wanted to mention is you can use LS from inside a different directory.

35
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.220
As long as you provide the correct path.

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.500
So let's say I wanted to see what's inside of the cat photo or cat photos directory without changing

37
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.230
into it.

38
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.060
I could just type.

39
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.590
LS cat photos remember I'm on the desktop but as long as I type ls and then the path it will tell me

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.320
what's inside of cat photos.

41
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.140
Of course I could also see into cat photos and then just type regular old ls.

42
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.010
But if you're just trying to figure out where a file is you may not want to change all the way into

43
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.830
the directory.

44
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.760
You can just use LS from anywhere.

45
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.940
And since we're here let's take a look at one of these.

46
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.910
Let's do this video Blue panting and mophie.

47
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.470
So this is a command that not really teaching in this lecture but just get added in here.

48
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.360
So if you use open and then a file name it will open the file for us.

49
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.910
And here's my cab flu panting really hard after playing with her toy so don't focus on open as much.

50
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.940
But if you want to you can try opening some existing files.

51
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.110
It will just pick whatever the default way of opening those files are.

52
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.760
So you know just like if you double clicked on a file it was a text file will probably open and whatever

53
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.880
your default text editor is on a Mac I think it's just called text edit a movie file.

54
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.570
It just opened in Preview.

55
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.790
Same with a JPEG.

56
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.620
Depending on you know your operating system.

57
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.480
But open is not the focus here.

58
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.830
It's really about less.

59
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.580
So once again less than its own just list the files that are inside of the current directory.

60
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.150
Now I'm going to go back to my home directory and other quick quiz named two ways to do that

61
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.670
all right.

62
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.170
So one way would be to do a CD and just type the till the just like that.

63
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.310
Another option would be to do cd dot dot two times C-D dot dot enter and then CD again.

64
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.190
First time take to the desktop.

65
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.340
The next time takes me to my home directory or I could have done CD slash users and given the entire

66
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.090
absolute path slash cold steel a little long but that would also work.

67
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.190
Takes me to where I already am.

68
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.480
I prefer this one but there are three options.

69
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.830
Hopefully you pick two of them.

70
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.270
OK so from here I can type LS.

71
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.050
I see the directories available but I want to go back to the slides and I added this note that you can

72
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.110
supply options are called flags.

73
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.620
They all start with a dash dash a or dash L.

74
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.770
Those are just two examples.

75
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.430
There's a bunch more but they tell us to work in a particular way.

76
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.640
So for example Dasch a will list all files including hidden files so you may not be familiar with hidden

77
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.030
files.

78
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.020
If you haven't used a terminal before if we look here it looks like these are the only files available

79
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.310
to me the only directories.

80
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.500
But if I do ls dash a.

81
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.570
You'll see a whole bunch of other things.

82
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.930
They all start with a dot.

83
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.660
So we have hidden files hidden folders something from Adobe something from Python.

84
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.210
Talk about that later.

85
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.490
Some node stuff.

86
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.750
Basically a lot of tools that I've installed create their own hidden files that you're not really supposed

87
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.150
to do anything with and that's why they're hidden.

88
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.740
Sometimes it's very rare but sometimes you may need to delete or look at a hidden file.

89
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.190
Usually if you're trying to do something sort of hacky so-ls dash a will do that for you.

90
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.570
And then there was also dash L which gives you a longer format.

91
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.070
So I'm going to go back to regular LS without the array.

92
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.820
And just to LS dash L and it gives me more information about the files.

93
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.250
So I believe over here is some permission information about reading and writing permissions.

94
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.750
I think this is who created the administrator.

95
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.890
The name of the file or folder the date that it was updated or last.

96
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.680
I don't know created or last updated and then something about the file size I believe.

97
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.270
Not positive.

98
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.590
Don't quote me on any of these but I just want to show you there is no more information available.

99
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.200
Most of the time you don't really need to use this.

100
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.730
We could combine them to A-L and now we get the hidden files as well and we get a lot of information

101
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.520
about them.

102
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.390
So that's really all I want to show here.

103
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.290
Ls on its own.

104
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.460
Isn't that useful but neither is CD.

105
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.770
But when you put them together you can really start to navigate forwards and backwards and find all

106
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.080
your files and do everything you need to do that you could do with Finder or with Windows Explorer but

107
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.210
do it from the command line.
