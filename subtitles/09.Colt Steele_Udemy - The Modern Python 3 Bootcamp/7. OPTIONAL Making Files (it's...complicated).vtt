00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.360
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.330
In this video I mean to show you how to create a file using power show.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.830
And I have to warn you that it kind of sucks to be honest.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.950
It sucks because it's a lot more verbose and an uglier syntax than it is.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.040
Using a Unix shell usually like when I'll be typing in the course.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.990
It's just touch and then a file name app.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.750
P Why if I wanted to make a new python file or I don't know Rock Paper Scissors are dot P Y and that

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900
would make me a new empty file.

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.380
It ideally would.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.840
It doesn't work in Power Shell but on a Mac on a Linux machine it works.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850
Unfortunately here it doesn't.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
So there's a couple of alternatives and if actually recorded this video more than once because the first

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.610
alternative that I showed looks like this let me just make a new directory.

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.850
I'm on my desktop.

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.980
I'll just call this what they call the playground and then CD into play ground and see if it's made

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.030
right here.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.830
Look at the phone to make a let's call file slide.

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.820
Why if I wanted to do that one option is this it looks kind of gross Ecko dollar sign no to greater

19
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.490
than signs and then the name of a file like slide dot he why what this does is it makes an empty file

20
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.300
this dollar sign.

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.260
No means don't put anything in the file.

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.410
If I had replace this something else it would be inserted into that file.

23
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.210
So dullish I know is a way of saying make it empty and if I type LS You can see it's now been created.

24
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.380
Double click here.

25
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.230
You can also see there's a pilot tells me it's a python file called Slide.

26
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.450
Now the problem that I don't want to get too far into the weeds with what I discovered after recording

27
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.850
this video once is that by default this command creates a file in what's known as UTF 16.

28
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.230
It's a text encoding.

29
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm not going to go into it too much.

30
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.030
All you need to know is that Python wants files or Python 3 wants UTF 8.

31
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.290
If I put some code in there like 1 plus 2 and I save.

32
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.920
I'm getting ahead of myself I know I know with Python and adding code but this hopefully you can see

33
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.350
it's just going to add two numbers together.

34
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.180
It is valid Python code to execute it.

35
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.190
I should be able to just run Python slide up.

36
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.210
But I get this awful error message.

37
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.210
Non UTF 8 code.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.820
And that's because I created the file with this command.

39
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.210
So long story short if you want to use that command you're welcome to but you'll have to do a File Save

40
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.840
with encoding UTF 8 and now it saves that.

41
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.730
If I go back I make clear to make space.

42
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.400
But if I run that command again it now works.

43
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.980
I don't see anything because I didn't print anything at an output but I didn't get an error anyway.

44
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.910
You probably don't need Python installed so this is a bit of a tangent but I needed to explain why that

45
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.040
command doesn't really work.

46
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.810
It's also just an ugly command compared to touch touches.

47
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.020
Very nice and succinct.

48
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.700
This is a lot of syntax.

49
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.120
So then the alternative.

50
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.430
I did some research and it got to be honest.

51
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.210
It's not any better at all.

52
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.250
It's just it's just different.

53
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.310
This is what it looks like.

54
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.270
New dash item space dash item type style and then the name of a file.

55
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.750
So we have slide up.

56
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.140
Let's go with swings.

57
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.380
P Why for going for playground theme.

58
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.770
I hit Enter ls and you can see we now have signed up right and swings p y.

59
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.470
So again that gross command new dash item dash item type file swings W-why or whatever file name.

60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.520
So I got to be honest if this was a command I had to type it every time.

61
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.530
I think that I just wouldn't type it.

62
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.010
I would just use the graphical user interface and I'll quickly show you what I mean.

63
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.250
We haven't talked about subcontext yet.

64
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.720
This is a text editor you can use any text editor but I'm just to show an example.

65
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.250
If I made a new file I might just do this file new file or command and save it and then just find the

66
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.490
directory I want to save it and manually.

67
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:21.590
Desktop I want to save it in playgrounds and I'm going to call it what do we have Swing's slide.

68
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.380
How about monkey bars.

69
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.230
P Y.

70
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.100
And then that will save the file there.

71
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.330
If I go back to power shell and type LS It's now there.

72
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.400
So remember the whole point of this section is to show you mostly how to navigate using the command

73
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.280
line so that if let's say had a brand new power show window and I need to run that file I just made

74
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.950
monkey bars stop I need to get there.

75
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.640
So I just need to know cam here I need to go to desktop and you move this up so you see it and it's

76
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.500
inside a playground.

77
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.770
And now I have access to monkey bars so I can run Python monkey bars.

78
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.820
I going do anything but this is what we need to be able to do.

79
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.300
And once again I want to reiterate we don't have Python installed but I'm just trying to prove why this

80
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.930
is important.

81
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.360
And I have to be honest.

82
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.380
Like I said those commands that we saw are pretty brutal to actually make a new file so they exist.

83
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.060
You can use them but I might honestly recommend just making your files using a text editor like sublime

84
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.170
or notepad.

85
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.400
So I just go you know file save and then find the directory as we already showed.

86
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.290
And you can just put this wherever it need to go.

87
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.340
Desktop playground.

88
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.070
And we'll call this one.

89
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.470
I don't know what else is on a playground sandbox.

90
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.790
Why now.

91
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.960
Back here type ls and we can see their sandbox.

92
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.430
All right.

93
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.200
So I know there was a lot especially with those tendons mixed in there.

94
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.060
I just want to make it clear that you do not have to do all of this.

95
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.670
You can make files whatever's the easiest way for you personally.

96
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.450
So don't feel too intimidated if you're new to this because frankly I would be intimidated too if I

97
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.550
had to remember these commands.

98
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.040
Something like that is just hideous in my opinion anyway so don't feel bad.

99
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.430
By the way if you do have a PC it's OK.

100
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.400
They're not at a disadvantage in any way in this course.

101
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.800
It's just that you might see me use a command that really it's only touch which I explained in this

102
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.600
video creates a new file.

103
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.940
If you need to make your own new file you could just use it any of the other ways I showed you using

104
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.900
supplied text using Notepad.

105
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.830
Whatever works.

106
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.740
Or if you remember these commands you could use that too.

107
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.560
Anyway next in the final thing I'm going to show you is how to delete how to remove folders and files.
