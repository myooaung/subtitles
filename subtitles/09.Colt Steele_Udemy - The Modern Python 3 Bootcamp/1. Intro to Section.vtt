00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.490
Everyone will come back.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.730
So this is a new section.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.440
I am adding to the end of the course.

4
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.730
A few months back I sent a survey out asking for topics that you guys were interested in and there were

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.620
really two things that stuck out like very clearly on the graph of the results sequel plus Python which

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.630
is what the section is on and then some data structures content computer science stuff.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.910
But the winner between the two was Python and sequel at least for now.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.640
So what I'm going to do in this section is not teach sequel from scratch.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.000
I have an entire course that is like 20 hours.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.420
Its a big topic or it can be a big topic depending on how far in-depth we go.

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.620
What we're going to do is basically start with the very basics have a single video on the basic syntax

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.820
of a sequel and then I'm going to show you how it works with Python.

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.450
So even if you don't know sequel you should be able to get something out of this by the end we're going

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.580
to be scraping some some Web sites and storing the data in a sequel database.

15
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260
But if you do no sequel.

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.160
The other thing that is kind of a challenge about this section is that there's a million different sequel

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.050
databases out there and they're all slightly different as far as their syntax but also they're different

18
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.340
as far as which Python adapter we use which module we use to connect to that database.

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
There's one of those multiple to work with postscripts or my as well or sequel light.

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890
There's all these different tools and I had to pick one and it came down to this.

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.210
There's tons of databases out there and it could have I could have made the decision based off of what

22
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.760
database is most commonly used with Python.

23
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.000
What database are my students wanting to learn the most.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660
In that case I would do something like Mongo probably.

25
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.150
But at the end of the day they all are a huge pain to install and they all work in a very similar way.

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.800
At least the sequel ones.

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.820
So things like my as well postgresql sequel light.

28
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.200
Once you understand the basics of how to connect to a database what a cursor is then it's just a tiny

29
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.430
tweak between the different databases to really migrate from one to the other.

30
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.920
So because they all are a pain to install especially things like my ask you all and postgresql across

31
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.440
different platforms we're using a database called sequel lite sequel like 3.

32
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.240
So it is a sequel database.

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.580
It's definitely not as full featured as something like my ass.

34
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.860
Q Will not used as commonly in production environments but it comes pre-installed on many machines.

35
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.150
So that's a plus.

36
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.960
We don't have to deal with installation on some machines.

37
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.770
It's not it won't be the case for everyone to have a video on that next.

38
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.350
It is a very simple syntax.

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.910
There's only a couple of data types we have to worry about.

40
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.110
It's not overly complicated so that we can focus on the Python part rather than having to spend you

41
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.350
know hours explaining sequel for postscripts.

42
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.790
But at the same time because it's not that complicated it's also not especially powerful.

43
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.490
So I'm not turn and use this as an example of this is the best sequel database ever.

44
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:51.610
It's just the best one to fit the needs of this section and also another good reason Python comes with

45
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.780
the sequel 3 module as part of the standard library.

46
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.690
So we don't have to install anything to connect to sequel 3.

47
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.180
Well on the Python side of things you might have to actually install sequel lite but we don't have to

48
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.170
go and install a package to use in python like we would with some other databases.

49
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.960
So that's where we're going.

50
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.860
We're going to start by in the next video talking about how do you know if you have it already.

51
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.970
And if you don't have to install it then we'll talk about the basics of sequel lite syntax and work

52
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.590
with the show sort of type some basic commands.

53
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.830
If you already know sequel then you can probably skip that and then afterwards we'll dive into the basics

54
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.250
of connecting with Python writing queries connecting to a database selecting things inserting data that

55
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.570
sort of thing and then finally we will scrape some data from a web site and store it into a database.

56
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.260
OK.

57
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.180
See then.
