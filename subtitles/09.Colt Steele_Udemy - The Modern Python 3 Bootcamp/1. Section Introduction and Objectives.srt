1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,610
A he made it to the next section.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,620
This one is on iterators and generators to kind of scary sounding words.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,270
We've talked about where we've used the word iterator before.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,980
When you're talking about loops.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,840
But now we're actually going to dive into some of the nitty gritty and trying to understand things like

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,080
the difference between an iterator and iterable or how we define our own iterators how we make a custom

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,300
class iterable then we're going to talk about generators and how it fits in with this whole picture.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,450
So it should be fun.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,690
We're going to dive into the details of how Python works or at least how loops work.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,050
So first objectives we going start off by comparing that word iterator and iterable.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,600
They are not the same thing.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,670
Then we want to understand these two important functions.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,930
One is called it her and the other is called next.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,630
Then we're going to learn to build our own simple for loop.

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,020
So we'll be using what we learn will recreate the for loop on our own.

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,130
We'll define it and then we're going to move to generators.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,140
We're going to talk about what generators are how they can be used we'll compare generator functions

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,930
and generator expressions and then we'll use generators to pause execution of expensive functions.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,690
Basically two parts to this entire section.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,190
First we talk about iterators and iterable.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,080
Next we talk about generators but they all kind of have to do with one another.

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,570
All right then in the next video we'll start by talking about iterators and iterable.
