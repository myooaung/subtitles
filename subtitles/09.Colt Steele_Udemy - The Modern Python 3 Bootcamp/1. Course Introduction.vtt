00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.890
Hey there welcome to the course.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.250
I have a ton to say but first I just want to add please do not skip this section.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.030
I know it's tempting to go ahead to installation or dive into the code that this course has multiple

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.370
starting points and this section will help you understand where you should start based off of your computer

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.090
you're using and also your experience level.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.400
I know this intro stuff is not the most enthralling content ever so I have thrown in some adorable photos

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.280
of my cats.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.530
Here's one.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.460
Just look at those eyes.

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.020
Right.

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.430
So I'll introduce myself very quickly.

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.540
My name's colt.

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.220
I have some emojis here.

14
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.610
That's me as a developer me as a teacher.

15
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.870
I have cats.

16
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.950
I prefer dogs.

17
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040
Sorry cats prefer dogs.

18
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.880
I live in San Francisco and music.

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.570
How unique.

20
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.680
I like music.

21
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.890
So this is me and one of my cats.

22
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
I've been teaching people how to code in all sorts of different languages for five plus years in person

23
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.160
at boot camp programs in the Bay Area and then online on platforms like you to me.

24
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.490
Ok enough about me let's talk about you.

25
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.930
So Python is a really broad topic and I decided to make this course not only as comprehensive as possible

26
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.010
but I want to make it open to as many different skill levels as possible.

27
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.570
Whether you're a complete programming newbie you've never written a line of code in your life or you've

28
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
written some other languages and you just want some help translating over to Python.

29
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.080
Or you have experience with Python already but you feel like you know it's not complete or you want

30
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.970
more practice with exercises.

31
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.500
This course can help you out.

32
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.400
Of course the experience you have will be significantly different depending on your skill level.

33
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.030
Can I address that in the exercises video later in this intro section.

34
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.490
And as a side note this course is not particularly focused around building web sites or data science

35
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.150
or automating things or machine learning or game development.

36
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.200
Anything like that.

37
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.540
It's a broad course but the goal is that you should be able to take this course and go on to learn any

38
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.340
of those topics that are built on top of Python.

39
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.710
The last thing we'll talk about in this video is a rough walkthrough of the curriculum.

40
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.900
We start off with the very basics of installing Python getting up and running with the command line

41
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.280
or power show.

42
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.470
Getting your editor going then we move on to the basics of the Python language.

43
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.300
We start with really simple stuff like variables.

44
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.140
Data Types a boolean and conditional logic.

45
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.520
We build a couple of versions of rock paper scissors and then we move on to things like loops and building

46
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.150
some simple games with loops.

47
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.670
Then we talk about data structures lists.

48
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.830
Dictionaries have a ton of exercises for each tuples and sets.

49
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.410
Then we get two functions which is a really important part of the course.

50
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.990
I've already talked about this in the promotional video but if you look at the function section it's

51
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.500
full of exercises.

52
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.900
It's hard to tell on the curriculum view here but each one of these little brackets symbols means it

53
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.800
indicates an exercise so you can see there's a ton of them in this section.

54
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.310
These are videos and then following it.

55
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.530
There's this entire section of exercises so there's a ton of exercises as we go.

56
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.740
Functions part 2.

57
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.340
We move on to there's a whole other problem set up for functions as well.

58
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.770
Then some trickier topics like lambdas and built in functions debugging and error handling.

59
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.540
How do we raise our own exceptions.

60
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.480
We talk about modules and this is the fun section we work with external libraries tools that other developers

61
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.050
have written to help us do some cool things.

62
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.100
We start working with HTP requests connecting with API as I did make this section optional.

63
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.000
If you have no interest in the web world you don't care about hype how Python talks to an API like Facebook

64
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.960
or something.

65
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.450
Then you can skip this.

66
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.290
It doesn't really come back up until the very end of the course.

67
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.550
In another optional section then we talk about two topics that are kind of notorious in Python generators

68
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.720
and decorators.

69
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.570
A lot of courses shy away from topics like this and I've done my best to make it as accessible as possible.

70
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.120
Lots of exercises as you can see.

71
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.310
Then we talk about OTOP object oriented programming.

72
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.900
Really big topic Opie's starts here and we finish up down here.

73
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.180
So there's a ton of content between the sections on object oriented programming.

74
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.770
We build a little application continuing down we talk about testing and test driven development.

75
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.690
There's a lot of different ways of if you're familiar with testing a lot of different ways of testing

76
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.550
in Python.

77
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.210
We cover a bunch of them then we talk about file I O.

78
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.680
So this is a fun topic.

79
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.360
How do we connect Python to files.

80
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.230
How do we save data to a file.

81
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.490
But more importantly how do we read in data from let's say some sort of CXXVI file containing crime

82
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.680
statistics or government data.

83
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.810
How would you read that and to analyze it using Python.

84
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.790
And then finally we get to my personal favorite topic which is web scraping.

85
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.370
If you're not familiar with scraping it's the idea of writing code that goes to a Web site that doesn't

86
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.270
have a publicly available API.

87
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.500
We crawl across hundreds of different web pages potentially or thousands and we extract data from those

88
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.310
Web sites.

89
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.000
So we build our own crawler our own spider using python that goes online and extracts book data from

90
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.940
an e-commerce Web site about hundreds of books Price's titles links that sort of thing and then it saves

91
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.080
them all in a file to be analyzed.

92
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.040
So the course covers a ton of material as you can see.

93
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.380
Each one of these sections almost all of them have five plus exercises.

94
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.500
Some of them have 20 exercises it's a lot.

95
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.930
And frankly it was more work to make those exercises to write all the code that goes into them all the

96
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.640
testing logic than it was for me to record.

97
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.900
Twenty something hours 25 hours of video or something like that.

98
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.470
So hopefully you enjoy having all those exercises at your disposal.

99
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.850
All right.

100
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.150
So that's the curriculum in the next video.

101
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.940
I'm going to answer a really important question which is why does this course cover Python 3.

102
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.950
How is it different than Python 2.

103
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.320
And why does it matter.

104
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.200
So that's next.
