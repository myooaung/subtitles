00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,350
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,260
So this is the first of our project sections.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,780
We have a bunch of these in the course where we kind of take a break from just lecturing and learning

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,760
new things with the slides and the exercises slides exercises.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,660
And instead we focus on building something a bit more substantial.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,350
So this project is going to be the simplest because we only have a couple of tools in our toolbox.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,580
We've got variables conditionals.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,940
We can get input and we can print things and that's pretty much it.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,460
But that's all we need to build a simple rock paper scissors game.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,110
But eventually these projects sections will pick up some steam.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,170
We're going to learn a lot more in the course and we'll end up doing things like connecting to API is

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,030
it connecting.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,790
Talking to servers through python or downloading H.T. mail scraping the web and parsing information.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,220
There's a whole bunch of fun things we'll do.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,370
We'll make some more complex games but this is our first one.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,050
And the way that this will work is that you can either do this on your own.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,950
So I'll give you in just that in just a moment I'll give you the instructions and you can attempt to

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,620
on your own.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,340
And then there's a solution video will actually create it or you can just go ahead and walk through

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,170
the video with me and create it together depending on how you feel what your comfort level is with things

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,060
like conditional statements.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,090
So before I show you the instructions I just want to point out I spent a lot of time putting these emoji

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,660
here and for some reason whenever I go to full screen they just disappear.

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,970
What is this.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,010
It's ridiculous.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,010
Anyway so the way that this works there are two versions.

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,220
So there is the basic version that we're going to start with and the basic version is well it's pretty

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,030
basic in that we have two human players.

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,780
So we basically you know rock paper scissors is printed out you don't have to do that.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,200
Maybe a welcome message and then player one enters a choice.

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,090
Rock paper scissors.

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,080
And then they hit enter and then Player 2 enters a choice.

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Rock paper scissors.

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,000
And then we can perhaps shoot or something.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,980
And then the result is printed.

36
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,490
So this obviously is is pretty basic and also kind of unplayable because player two can see what player

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,380
one has done.

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,760
So in my solution.

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,840
Actually over here if I run Python 3 let's say player one play scissors.

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,020
I added a bunch of these lines that say no cheating no cheating no cheating so that you can't see.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,860
Player 2 can't see you player one entered and now.

42
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,180
Player 2 enters rock and Player 2 wins but they were unaware that player 1 played scissors.

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,530
So this is the first most basic version and that's what we're going to start by building.

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,320
And then once we have that logic we're going to build upon it in the more advanced version that includes

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,140
a simple computer.

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,690
I don't even want to call it an AI just a computer player that plays random moves rock paper scissors.

47
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,280
So we'll get to that but we're going to start with this basic version.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,620
So try this on your own if you feel comfortable with it.

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,360
Just make a new file.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,250
Hopefully you can see kind of where you need to use conditional logic where you need to get user input

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,350
that sort of thing.

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,450
And if not then just build it along with me in the next video.

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,900
And then after that we'll have the intermediate version.

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,240
All right let's get started.
