1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,080
Okeydokey.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,180
So I decided to add the video on comments which I mentioned at the beginning of this section has nothing

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,080
to do with math.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,290
It's just an oddball single topic that needs to go somewhere.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,270
So I decided to put it between the two Mathie videos in this section.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,620
So if you're looking for the weirder operators video that after this one this will be super quick.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,630
So comments like I said it's a weird one off topic but it's an important one so comments are just a

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,730
way for us to write little notes instead of our code that won't actually be run.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,370
So let me show you I'm actually going to make a new file so I don't have any files in this directory

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,940
and make a file and we're just going to call it comment.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,350
Dot p y.

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,070
And then I'm going to open comments up.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,110
Why if you don't have this double as you B.L. shortcut or for using Cloud 9 you could cloud 9 just double

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,590
click on comments IPY or you can use open comments that way and will use whatever text editor.

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,040
So I have this here and let's just start by writing something like.

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:08,320
1 divided by three and let's print one two out of three because remember if we just do one Redway three

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,520
without that print nothing will show up and we run this file because it is in a file.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,330
We're not using the Python interpreter in the command line so we'll just start with this.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,100
All right.

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:26,070
So back in the terminal I can run Python 3 common step y and we get 0.3 3:3 great.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,970
So what we expect.

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,730
So let's say we wanted to add a note though that said something like always returns float division returns.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,540
Well we can antimagic comment with this character the hash the pound symbol is actually called an octave

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,350
Thorpe.

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,540
It's kind of a piece of trivia that I might repeat too much in my courses but oh well to Thorpe.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,330
So we can write whatever we want after this.

27
00:01:49,330 --> 00:02:01,690
So a little note to ourself like division return's float even when dividing two ants and that's all

28
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,770
there is to a comment.

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:09,100
So if I didn't have this comment Python would try and run this and that would be a big problem.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,650
Make sure you save your file before you do anything.

31
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,110
If I try and run it now I get the error saying invalid syntax because it doesn't know what the heck

32
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,810
is going on because that's English not Python.

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,110
So I can add my comment there.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,960
Also as a side note if you are using an editor like sublime even in cloud 9 the text editor or atom

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,770
you can highlight something in that and type command slash in it will comment the entire line.

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,400
So wherever put command slash that line is commented out or you can just type single Octa thought.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,760
All right.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,100
So now if I do this hit the up arrow to rerun it I don't get any errors.

39
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,660
I don't have anything afterwards.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,930
So down here I could do something like 1 divided by 5.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,730
It doesn't matter.

42
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:56,170
You could comment out Python itself actual valid syntax and still nothing will happen because it's commented

43
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,380
out.

44
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,260
So this just tells Python ignore whatever comes after this and that's all there is to comments.

45
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,280
So let me just prove that one more time.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,940
Run it again.

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,030
And this second line doesn't occur to Python it's like it's not even there.

48
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,980
Cloak of invisibility from the Python interpreter.

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,760
So on the topic of comments.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,660
One thing that students often ask is when should I use these when do people use them.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,200
We'll talk more about this when we talk about style and conventions but generally for you if you're

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,300
learning Python I think it helpful to add comments to yourself to remind you of things because often

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,890
just looking at a line of code.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,940
It's not all that self-explanatory especially early on.

55
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,640
So you can add a comment or two to kind of remind you of what the heck's going on.

56
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,640
But also in the real world comments are used to help other developers understand what's happening.

57
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,270
So you might have some code that is very specific to something that you built and maybe I'm working

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,450
a team of 10 people.

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:54,970
I write some long thing that's 20 lines I could add a comment that says hey you know this little function

60
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,110
does X or Y and then anyone else in my team could see it and immediately just know what it does.

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,170
They wouldn't have to step line by line through it.

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,210
Now depending on the company and the team some places really would like you to comment your code a lot

63
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,190
other places don't want code don't want comments at all and they think code should be self-explanatory.

64
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,680
So it's really just a culture thing.

65
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,940
But if you're learning I highly recommend using comments I don't care personally with my students if

66
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,290
they comment every single line.

67
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,070
So long as it helps them learn and they're not just wasting time writing comments instead of code.

68
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,190
All right so that's comments.

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,160
Now back to our regularly scheduled not boring math program.
