00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.280
So this is the Mac installation instructions for getting a command line or terminal up and running on

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.090
your machine.

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
And it's actually going to be really quick because if you have a Mac you don't actually need to install

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.400
anything.

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.070
So let's go over to my Mac.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.070
Here's all my top secret files on the desktop and out of the box.

8
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.480
All Macs actually come with a terminal so you can find it using command space to open up spotlight and

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.280
just type terminal and open that up.

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200
And this is our terminal.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.290
Here's might look a little bit different.

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.910
We'll obviously have some different information appear in here.

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.720
But this is at terminal out of the box.

14
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.010
You can spend time changing colors and fonts and all of that up in preferences.

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.780
I'm going to leave mine with a white background.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.510
And this is a terminal so you can type something just typed in gibberish and hit enter.

17
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.040
We get an error because that's not a valid command.

18
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.780
But that's fine.

19
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.210
You can try running a valid command like allies or PWT which will cover in the next video.

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.570
And you should see something.

21
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.590
Again this is specific to my machine but you should see something at least.

22
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.980
Now I did mention that you can install an additional command line.

23
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.930
There's one called I'd term that a lot of people like to use it really just gives you some additional

24
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.810
functionality and also some additional choices when it comes to preferences and styling and colors and

25
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.360
all that.

26
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.650
So it's called I term can go to term to dot com and all you have to do is click on download.

27
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.520
So don't get caught up in this at this point.

28
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.610
But if you're someone who does like to customize things this allows you to do more customization than

29
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.470
the default out of the box terminal.

30
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.150
But you do not need to install it and in fact in this course I'm just going to use the plain old vanilla

31
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.880
terminal just to remove any possible confusion.

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.040
But a lot of my students the past have really liked I turned 2 and it's free of course and there's some

33
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.250
good documentation but all you need to do is download it and then open it up.

34
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.530
I have it here and it just gives me a window and I can do the exact same thing typing my commands and

35
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.830
make this bigger hit enter and I get the same result.

36
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300
So just two different ways.

37
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.100
Two windows into the same exact thing.

38
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.750
All right so that's it.

39
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.260
Very simple installation video because well you don't really have to install anything.
