1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,540
OK.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,270
So we've seen a lot of different characters in some of the syntax so far.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,340
We're not done.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,930
We're not going to go over everything but in this video I'm going to focus on one feature which are

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,930
these square brackets on this cheat sheet you call some of the character classes section.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,420
It allows us to specify groups of characters or ranges of characters.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:30,600
So back here if I if I want to select any vowel but say I can't just do a e i o u that's gonna match

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,890
exactly.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,640
I or you and we don't have any instances of that.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,270
But if I put it in these brackets A.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,310
Oh you like that.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,260
Now it's going to match any instance any anything where there is one of these characters.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,590
So e o o I want it to match you know double vowels.

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,960
I could just add to there.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,150
Now it's finding any time there are two vowels next to one another.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,450
Years and g mail and then this thing here.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,820
And it is case sensitive so we could you know if we put the uppercase A in there.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,080
It's different.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,070
Also I should mention we can use ranges of characters.

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,400
So the common ones you'll see lowercase a dash Z.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,110
It's going to be any lowercase letter.

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,300
So it doesn't include any of these uppercase letters.

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,440
Doesn't include this uppercase s are numbers it's only lower case letters.

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,850
You could do a through I don't know f and it only gives us the letters between a NF.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,500
Not that common to do that maybe.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,220
Actually if you're doing hexadecimal if you're familiar with hexadecimal this would work.

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,400
Where are the letters that are allowed or a b c d e f.

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,240
You can also do uppercase.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,410
So a through capital Z is going to be all uppercase letters.

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,020
So that gives us purple if I wanted to select all words that are only you know one or more uppercase

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,970
letters I could do.

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:03,630
Plus there will actually one or more but stoops to two or more.

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,550
And that gives us purple's the only instance where there's more than one uppercase character in a row.

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,560
I add another one.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,880
LR Well it also selects that you could do numbers like this zero 3 9 which we've already seen you know

36
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,710
slashy backslash d to select digits.

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:31,270
The reason you would do this if you wanted lower case letters or numbers is this a dash to see zero

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,130
or Dash 9.

39
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,840
So that's all lower case letters all digits.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,020
So you can use the square brackets to specify custom ranges or groups of characters.

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,530
One nice thing I'll show you is the carrot character.

42
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,010
If you use it on its own outside of the square brackets we'll see in the next video.

43
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,170
It means something different but inside square brackets it it means not.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,500
So if I had let's say I really hate the letter.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,300
What a way.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,390
I don't really hate anything let's say anything that's not the letter K.

47
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,010
Well if I just do K it's only going to get me.

48
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:10,980
But if I do not the letter K gives me anything that is in the letter K so any values I put in here.

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,870
Let's say anything that is not zero through nine or a vowel so a e i o u.

50
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,250
And that gives me Oh that is including spaces.

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,660
So it's also at a space in there and I think and the at sign so you know for trying to only get consonants

52
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,980
which is what my goal was.

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,410
We're close although it still includes special characters so we could put any special character in here

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,830
to Sarkin to be included now because we have that carrot there.

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,940
And if we removed it it's only going to select the numbers and the vowels the spaces and the outside.

56
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:49,690
OK.

57
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,470
So that is square brackets very useful back in the slides.

58
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,080
You might remember the email example I use square brackets a lot.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,360
So at the beginning we're looking for lower case letters uppercase letters digits underscore period

60
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,660
plus sign in the dash one or more of those it's the plus sign means as we've seen.

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,490
So we put them in the square brackets.

62
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,650
Same thing here slightly different use slightly different use here but the same idea where we're selecting

63
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,760
these from a group of acceptable values.

64
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,070
Ok so that is the square brackets.
