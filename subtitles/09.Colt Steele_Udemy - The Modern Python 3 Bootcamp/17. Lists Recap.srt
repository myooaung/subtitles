00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,940
Get this video has no new information in it.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,850
So skip it if you don't care.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,810
But I do feel like there's so much coverage in this section.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,240
It would be nice to have a little recap video.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,860
Or you could just check out the recap slide so we covered all the ground.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,050
We started by talking about the basics of lists.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,790
We saw how to make a simple list.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,930
They are a fundamental data structure for any ordered information.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,330
So there's a key thing.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,460
The order remember all lists are indexed starting at zero.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,160
Lists can be any type even other lists which we just saw nested lists so we can have strings in there

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800
we can have numbers we can booleans other lists.

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,400
Want to talk about dictionaries.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,800
Anything and they don't all have to be homogenous we can have a string and then a number and then a

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,170
nested list we can modify this with a ton of list methods that we saw we can add to them with things

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:58,160
like impend we can remove from them with things like pop we can sort them reverse them.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,600
There's a whole bunch of things we saw slices are their own sort of beast which are ways of dividing

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,400
up while their way of taking and copying sections of lists.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,290
You could copy the entire list.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,130
You could go from the middle to the end go from the beginning to the middle but then only do every other

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:22,820
index slices or their whole thing miscomprehension it was another big topic and it's used everywhere

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,220
in Python when it Szeryng iterating over lists strings and ranges and even more data types like dictionaries

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,600
so we haven't discussed yet.

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,740
And we can use them to create duplicate lists we can use the list comprehension to create a duplicate

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,780
that modifies a list by multiplying every number or adding conditional logic.

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,290
There's a lot of things we can do and then we talked about ness of this.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,030
They are essential for building more complex data structures things like gameboard modeling real world

28
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,190
data chart data tabular data matrices.

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,220
And then finally we talked about swapping and swapping is just a nice useful trick that you can use

30
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,260
to just swap elements in a list.

31
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,120
Use the comma to separate them and then equals to assign new values.

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,460
And it's something we use when when you shuffle lists or sort them and write our own algorithms.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,340
OK that's a lot lot.

34
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,070
In this section.

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:22,640
So I recommend that you practice if if you're feeling weak on list comprehension with nested lists and

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,330
conditionals.

37
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,970
That's OK.

38
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,330
If the syntax isn't quite sitting right with you yet don't panic but make sure you're good with the

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,090
basics of lists using list methods.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:40,040
Slices the basics of list comprehension accessing nested loops and the basics of swapping and then move

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,810
on and celebrate that we're done with lists but also we're not because we're going to use them in everything

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,740
from here on out.

43
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,170
Anyway I'll stop talking.

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,260
Congratulations.

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,770
Hopefully you survived.
