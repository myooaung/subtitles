1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,660
Lou.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,350
This video is a bit of a surprise.

4
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,410
It was unplanned.

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,730
So I didn't reference it in the last video but I think that it could be necessary.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,530
What is the video.

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,980
Well it's a quick crash course on the aged him out and see assess for people who have never worked with

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,440
them.

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,620
If you have a working knowledge of age to mounseer says you don't even need to be able to write it just

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,970
if you understand what they are and how they work together.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,260
Then you can move on go to the next video and we'll start scraping.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,450
But if you don't if you've never seen H.M.S. just as you don't understand what it is then watch this

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,400
video and then Web scraping will make more sense because the whole point of scraping is that we are

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,370
getting data extracting it out of each team mouth so it helps to understand what it taught him.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,690
It's OK.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,110
So Timo stands for HyperText Markup Language And let's focus on that last part markup language the whole

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,020
idea is that I have some text some data some information that I'm going to send from one computer to

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,520
another.

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,550
Let's say I have a recipe or a research paper or a study.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,920
Let's go with the recipe though.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,520
I have my recipe for S.F. sourdough low for something like this.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,720
That's the title.

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,490
And then I could add a little thing that says you know written by Cold Steel and then I want to have

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,550
some bullet points for ingredients we have ingredients and then I somehow want to have bullet points.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,900
So I want the first one to be I don't know flour and I'm not going to put in measurements It's just

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,830
say flour and water and yeast and I guess for sourdough you need the starter sourdough starter.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,580
I'm actually learning how to make sourdough right now so I'm not an expert.

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,360
It's very bizarre.

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,710
I have a colony growing in a jar in my kitchen right now.

30
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,760
They have to feed every day that one day I'll make sourdough from Anyway this is enough here.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,440
So I have this information.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,370
This is all that there is to a recipe.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,580
It's just data points you know ingredients.

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,330
And then the actual steps.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,840
So the whole point of HMO is to be able to send information like this but also encode additional information

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,450
about it in code structure because when I send a message it might just all end up like this.

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,590
And this is sort of an exaggeration but imagine that this is what sent on an index card.

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,610
It's not how it works Of course it's not sent written on anything it sent as ones and zeroes across

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,430
a cable.

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,740
But imagine that we have an index card and I'm sending it to someone across the world.

41
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,610
And I want to be able to tell them Oh this right here.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,450
This should be bold.

43
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,950
This is the title and it should be 32 pixels font.

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,910
And this is the title I mean.

45
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,800
And then this written by Colt that should be on the next line below it and it should be italicized in

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,770
a smaller font.

47
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,370
And then we have ingredients and then should be bolded but not as big as a set of sourdough loaf and

48
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,350
then flour water yeast and sourdough starter should all be bullet points.

49
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,860
If I wanted to actually add that structure how could I do it.

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,590
I mean there's so many ways that I could do it I could do something like big colon and then maybe put

51
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,300
all of this in parentheses and then I could say italics colon.

52
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,510
And this is not aged him by the way but this is my version of encoding structure.

53
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,140
This would work and Tim L maybe could have been written this way.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,840
But instead the syntax I was chosen uses tags like this.

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,380
You've probably seen these before.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,450
So we have these angle brackets less than greater than brackets around a word like body and then often

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,230
there is a closing tag of these to correspond these to.

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,860
Here we go.

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,180
Or these two correspond or head and head correspond.

60
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,090
And there's a slash that shows the closing tag that designates the closing tag.

61
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:37,770
OK.

62
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,040
So there's a bunch of tag names.

63
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,170
We're not going to go into all of them this is again a crash course in not showing how to actually write

64
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,280
a bunch of Timo and I was going to show you what it looks like.

65
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,110
Let me get rid of this.

66
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,540
And let's say that I wanted to actually show you some edged him out here.

67
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,740
What I'm going to do when I take all this and move it up here.

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,320
What I have here this is known as h tim old boilerplate.

69
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,900
If I get rid of this I have an H him l file crash course that h him out.

70
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,600
If I type him on hit tab and sublime text clips it gives me this out of the box.

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,870
It's so commonly used every time I'll Dokument when we make we'll have this at a bare minimum.

72
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,910
This is just the starter and there are certain things we can fill in like a title.

73
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,810
So in here we'll put.

74
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,990
I don't know recipe let's just put bread recipe like this and save.

75
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,650
So I remember how I said data is sent from one computer to another and we want to encode the structure.

76
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,360
The other side of the equation once we actually write each Tim L your browser is going to receive the

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,370
edged him out and then render it and display it according to the rules.

78
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,650
So if it sees a title bread recipe as our title what it does with the title it's sort of counterintuitive

79
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,240
if you haven't worked with him.

80
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,250
It puts it at the top of the window or at the top of the tab in your browser.

81
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,950
It doesn't actually show on the page.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,510
If I open this file crash course that aged him all should open my web browser and we'll see him in full

83
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,290
screen.

84
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,900
But you can see right here bread recipe is my title.

85
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,520
So it's done that for me automatically and that's really all that's a relationship between him and your

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,440
browser shemale contains instructions whether they're written by us when we're developing our own site

87
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,800
or from Facebook when we get a response from Facebook when we load the page or I click log in it sends

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,770
T-Mo and my browser displays it.

89
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,000
OK so now let's just run through a couple of tags and paste all this in.

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,970
I accidentally delete that.

91
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,300
So if I want to make this the largest text on the page I can wrap it in an each one tag.

92
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,820
Age stance or header.

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,160
One is the largest.

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,740
There's one down through 6 1 8 1 2 8 6.

95
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,190
So if I just do this all of this text is going to be on the page but only this text is going to be extra

96
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,920
large if I refresh.

97
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,660
There we go.

98
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,870
Make that a bit bigger.

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,210
This is extra large and this is just regular text next phone and make this italicised.

100
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,880
I have a couple of options.

101
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,850
There's the old way is using an eye.

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,730
Now you're supposed to use E-M for emphasis.

103
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,010
And if I do this and it go back to my browser and refresh I don't know if you can tell but this is now

104
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,140
a tablet I italicised it looks like I missed my last name so let's add that in.

105
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,450
OK.

106
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:31,460
Next thing we have ingredients so ingredients we will make an H three and then our water used to sourdough

107
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,870
starter.

108
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,860
All of those We're going to be bullet points the way we do that is by creating an unordered list.

109
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,870
And then inside we make a bunch of lift list items.

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,230
And what I'm doing by the way typing ally and hitting tab and it auto completes it for me.

111
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,700
OK.

112
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,150
So we have our flower in one and we have water.

113
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,400
And let's just do yeast for now.

114
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,980
So all the same data same information here I'm just adding extra stuff around it.

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
And then the browser is going to take care of it.

116
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,280
Here we go.

117
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,190
And look at that.

118
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,540
We have some structure.

119
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,850
So if we actually look at the page source this is all that is sent to my browser.

120
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,760
Right now it's coming from my own computer.

121
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,460
But if this was coming from a Web site we get to my back and then the browser displays it correctly.

122
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,830
Now there are a ton of other elements different tags that we can write in HMO besides italics and large

123
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,150
text and bullet points.

124
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,190
You can do things like add images and hyperlinks all sorts of things.

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,350
Videos many many things that I can't even think of.

126
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,960
There's like 100 something tags I believe.

127
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,260
So we're not going to go into them.

128
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,960
All I want you to understand is that information is inside of tags.

129
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,650
If I'm on this web page here and I wanted to scrape what I need to do but say I want every title this

130
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,820
is a blog I want all the title titles of the blog posts I could right click and click inspect and this

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,040
will show me the underlying Timo.

132
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,950
These are the Google Chrome developer tools and what we can see if I click this little button I can

133
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,580
highlight over things.

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:18,460
So this whole thing right here is an article and then inside that article we have an H for called section

135
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,520
heading where is the section heading further down there is this is the section heading inside of that

136
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,410
we have something called a tag says a hyperlink and then the text right there.

137
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,500
New Year's resolution Developer Edition.

138
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,930
That is the data I would want so we identify the information we want it's enraged him.

139
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,850
This is a data I want to grab with Python or something.

140
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,020
Then I have to be able to tell Python how to get here.

141
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,630
I need to know the you know the path that we took.

142
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,850
It's like Hansel and Gretel little breadcrumbs.

143
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,830
It's in an article.

144
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,360
And then there's nature for and then there's an anchor tag and then take the text in the middle of an

145
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,170
anchor tag.

146
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,310
In the next video is when will actually start doing the scraping.

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,620
But what else should I talk about with him.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,580
So there's tags like I said information inside of them.

149
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,900
Most web sites are much much more complicated than this but there's nothing really extra.

150
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,740
It's just a lot of time.

151
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,500
A lot of tags all the information is contained in tags but there might be 10000 tags on like a Facebook

152
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,910
home page or something.

153
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,420
Lastly let me intro see SS very very quickly.

154
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,190
SS stands for cascading style sheets.

155
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,210
All we'll focus on is the style part of that.

156
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,870
So C Ss allows us to add style.

157
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,360
Right now this web page is hideous from the look today it's black and white.

158
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,000
Most web pages aren't they have fancy fonts and colors and backgrounds and animations and all sorts

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,510
of things and we can specify that with C Ss so I'm going to show you here is not necessarily best practice

160
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,290
but because this is a short video.

161
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,620
I mean just so the quickest easiest way to add style we can type a style tag.

162
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,740
What you're usually supposed to do is put your C S S code in a separate file and then link to it here

163
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,380
so that you have an HMO file and then a separate CSSA file.

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,710
But I'm going to do it in line meaning in the same file.

165
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,040
So here's the syntax if I want to make H-1 purple.

166
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Who wouldn't.

167
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,370
Such a great color then I do this right here.

168
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,000
H-1 then these brackets inside of them key value pairs.

169
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,600
Sort of like a dictionary.

170
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,100
Color Purple.

171
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,670
I could also do something like background.

172
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,180
This can be so ugly.

173
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,550
Background yellow.

174
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,390
And then I need the semi-colons afterwards.

175
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,680
Unlike some Unlike Python for example we need this to specify the end of a line.

176
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,060
If I now refresh my page look at that beautiful purple text with a yellow background and it's worth

177
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,060
noting that applies to all h ones on the page.

178
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,720
There just happens to only be one next.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,700
Let's say I want to alter the style of all lies.

180
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,470
So we just select ally and then our brackets.

181
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,580
And inside I'm not showing you you know there's so many properties just like each time all tags there's

182
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,030
at least 100 if not 200 properties.

183
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:07,060
We can change besides color and background but say I want all allies to be red and the colors I'm using

184
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,830
are just built in ugly colors.

185
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,190
You can make your own custom colors but I'm not going to get into that here.

186
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,330
So color is red and font size is going to be 20 pixels so we're making it larger.

187
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,510
So this applies to all allies.

188
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,590
I refresh my page.

189
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,210
I'm using command are.

190
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,680
Hopefully you can see they grew a little bit and they're all red.

191
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,090
Now that's the very basics of C S S.

192
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,800
The last thing I'll show you is commonly things are styled using classes and IDs.

193
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,790
So as I showed you here typing ally and giving styles is going to make every list item on the page the

194
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,410
exact same all of them are going to be read and 20 pixels.

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,330
If I wanted to single this one out and make flour I don't know blue.

196
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:55,030
Instead what I could do is give this ally an ID ID equals first or something.

197
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:01,330
It's just an arbitrary name that I've made up and it needs to go in the tag itself not inside not in

198
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,270
between.

199
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,670
And then over here I can select based off of first like this.

200
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,720
I use the Octa Thorpe and then the name of the ID and then same brackets.

201
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,680
And if I say color is blue it's going to find the item whatever it is.

202
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,580
It could be an ally could be an H-1 whatever has idea first is now going to be blue.

203
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,980
So I'll save refresh.

204
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,060
You can see it change to be blue.

205
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,910
And if I move that ID which by the way an idea is supposed to be used once on a page so it's to single

206
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,940
one item out.

207
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,310
Let's move it to the emphasis tag and refresh.

208
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,620
This is now blue.

209
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,260
OK.

210
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,880
So an idea is used to call one thing out.

211
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,720
There's also something called class and this allows us to create a grouping or a class of items that

212
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,950
are styled similarly and we can impact more than one thing at a time.

213
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,220
Unlike an ID so to say my idea is an idea except we can apply it to multiple items.

214
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,770
So let's say I have let me add a couple more Elyas here and I want the last two these two to have a

215
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,440
class.

216
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,500
So I'm going to just type class equals instead of ID and then give them a name and let's just call them

217
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,530
green.

218
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,310
Now I can select based off of the class which is slightly different.

219
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,530
We don't use the octave Thorpe.

220
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,660
We use a dot and then I can type a dot and the name of the class which green and then what I want to

221
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,030
happen to agree things let's do color teal.

222
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,230
Great color.

223
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,470
And now if I go back refresh There we go.

224
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,870
So we have all of these lies.

225
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,230
And before we restyling them all together but then I singled out this one with an idea and made it blue

226
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,840
and singled out these two with a class and made them teal.

227
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,320
So an ID is for one item classes for as many as you want.

228
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,590
And the reason that this matters is that in the scraping videos as we progress through this section

229
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,610
we can actually use these classes to identify information that we want to extract because a lot of times

230
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,730
Web sites will use classes and let's say we're looking at Craigslist for example they might have a tag

231
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,240
called a paragraph tag and there may be thousands on a page but all of the ones that have apartment

232
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,600
details as a class are the ones that we want.

233
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,100
So we don't want all paragraphs.

234
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,790
We only want ones with class apartment details.

235
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,140
Well now that we understand what a class is and we know that we use a dot to access it we see assess

236
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,210
when we actually see how to select things with beautiful soup which is the module I'm going to show

237
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,360
you in the next video.

238
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,830
It will help to understand classes and ideas as well as Team attacks.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,360
So this has been very unstructured.

240
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,860
If you are actually curious learning aged him out there are great courses out there free and paid.

241
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,760
I have one.

242
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,830
I think I'm allowed to say that if not I hope I'm not in trouble.

243
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,830
But there are good courses out there.

244
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,110
I highly recommend you learn H.T. mounseer says.

245
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,600
It's a great very easy skill to pick up compared to something like Python because as you can see here

246
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,680
I mean you're not really typing any logic at all.

247
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,810
It's pure.

248
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,480
Do this for me and make it green make it blue.

249
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,900
Put this here as a bolt point and make it purple.

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,320
And that's pretty much it.

251
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,790
OK.

252
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,290
That wraps up this crash course next.

253
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,110
Now that we understand what Tim is just a data format to send data back and forth to encode information

254
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,730
about it what should be big what should be small what's italicised what's a photo and so on.

255
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,710
And then we shall see assess which is a way to control how things look.

256
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,160
We saw them together.

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,430
Now we're going to see how to actually extract information out of HCM from any web site using something

258
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,400
called beautiful soup.

259
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,820
That's next.

260
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,330
He made.
