00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.570
All right.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.310
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.360
So now that we've created tables with equal lights we're going to see the syntax to insert data into

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.230
those empty tables so that they are no longer empty.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.670
And then of course later not in this video we'll see how to do the same thing with a python interface.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.160
So I have a file here that I've been working in but for now I'm just going to go back to my terminal

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.290
which I have here and we're working in the cat's database.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.740
The dogs one is identical it's just a different name for the table but we can see there's a cat table.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.200
And each cat has a name a breed and an age.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.000
So if I want to add into that cat table I would do inserts into and then the name of the table cat.

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.250
And then I need to specify what I'm inserting.

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350
So I would say if I'm going to do.

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.300
Name and then breed and then age just like that then I need to type of values and then match that order.

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.260
So I need to have a name correspond to the first thing that I enter.

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.250
So let's have blue is the first one Vrede is scottish fold and age is like three something.

16
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.030
I'm not sure how old she is and then I need a semi-colon.

17
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.680
And this is a preview to the next video.

18
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.930
I want to see if it works.

19
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
I can do select star from cats.

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.390
Technically this should be capitalized.

21
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.650
It won't make a difference though and we can see that she's in there.

22
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.870
But if I had to change the order here or if I had done this differently for example blue instead of

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.310
blue lets do I don't know Charlie.

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.540
It's the name.

25
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.190
But then if I said breed was like 35 and then age is what's ACAP read tabby.

26
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.460
I don't even know if that's actually a breed and I hit enter.

27
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.490
And now I look at my cats again you'll see that our breed is 35 and our age is Tabby which is not really

28
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.230
what we wanted to happen at all.

29
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.070
So that's not good.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.660
So you want to make sure that whatever you write the whatever order you have here is what you follow

31
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.400
over here.

32
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.810
So we want to make sure that we have breed before age which is not what I did and hopefully this goes

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.840
without saying but to incertain to another table you just change the name here insert into dogs entered

34
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.020
into whatever.

35
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.420
The other thing I'll show you here that doesn't necessarily have to do with inserting if you want to

36
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.470
insert a bunch.

37
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.890
There's actually a couple of ways to insert bulk bulk insert but I'm not going to show that here but

38
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.090
let's say that we have like five of these statements that I want to do and I don't want to type them

39
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.660
out all the time.

40
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.860
What we could do is write it all in a file whereas my file.

41
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.240
Here we are.

42
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.250
So we had the create table I'm going to comment that out.

43
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.800
Those are the sequel comments by the way.

44
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.420
Kind of odd and let's say I'm going to do an insert into this time let's do dogs.

45
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.510
So insert into dogs and we have name age and breed.

46
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.740
Let's do it that way.

47
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.490
Why not.

48
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.320
And then values will be.

49
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.020
We'll have champ I guess who is for who is a Husky.

50
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.320
And then let's say I want a couple of these and then I'll duplicate this four times.

51
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.100
But instead of Champ let's do Rosie.

52
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.130
ROSE Sure.

53
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.580
Rose is a chihuahua.

54
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.220
Then we'll have Moose who is a lab.

55
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.800
She'd give them different ages.

56
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.990
Rose will be 11 will be five and Peggy will be nine.

57
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.930
And piggy is a corgi.

58
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.660
All right.

59
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.260
So I have these statements imagine I have a thousand different things.

60
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.060
Again there's better ways of doing this but with what we know have them in this file.

61
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.880
I can actually execute this file as sequel so I don't have to type code in manually over here.

62
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.600
OK.

63
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.960
So that file where I was typing my sequel commands was called basics as well.

64
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.890
Sequel then I have my dog database file this is where we want to save our data to.

65
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.710
So I'm going to open up the database dog database and I need sequela three don't I.

66
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.480
And we have a table in there called dogs.

67
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.690
It's empty.

68
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:15.810
Now I want to run this file and to do that I can use the read command read basic Stut sequel and I hate

69
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.240
this.

70
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.290
No feedback.

71
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.400
But if we look at tables that was dumb of me we're not going to see a change if we do a select star

72
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.100
from dogs.

73
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.720
We now get those for dogs.

74
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.510
So what we just did was type all that secret code into a separate file and execute that file.

75
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.490
So there a couple of things going on and remember we opened up a database that had a table in it already

76
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.640
it was empty but it had a table a pattern defined.

77
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.170
Then we ran our file called Basic Set as well.

78
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.710
We read it inside of school at 3.

79
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.870
Using this database was connected to this database and it inserted four dogs into the dogs table in

80
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.710
that database.

81
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.560
So we also could have just done it here of course like we did with cats but I just the show you can

82
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.310
do it from a file.
