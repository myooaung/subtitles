1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,660
OK in this video let's start by adding the play again behavior.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,840
Right now the game ends after one play through and we have this after a while loop code.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,070
Let's replace this with the code that would basically start the whole thing over.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,440
I'm going to ask the user so I'll do a variable called again and I'll ask the user to know if they want

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,140
to play again.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,630
So I'll do something like.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,900
Would you like to play again.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,980
Question mark.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,460
And then just do Y such and an inference with a question mark afterwards.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,690
I think that works better.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,350
And what would be best is if we allow or we check to make sure a user enters one of these or the word

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,840
yes or no.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:53,080
So we could do while again is not in and just do a tuple with y comma Yes and comma no.

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,020
Well again it's not in there.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,260
Well ask again.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,840
And all set again to be an empty string or none.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,590
Doesn't really matter.

18
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,020
All right.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,150
So we start off this is kind of the same thing we did with Guess guess what an empty string.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,070
And then that made this part true.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,480
So we then asked for a guess again or started an empty string that makes this entire thing run.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,090
And it's true.

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,050
So this is executed because an empty string is not in here.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,050
We'll ask them and we'll keep asking.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,550
And then we need to check if again dot let's do Dalt lower is in.

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,210
And I should also do lower here just to be consistent.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,670
If it's yes or no.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,260
If it's one of those.

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,610
You could also just say if again that lower is yes or Again lower is why this is shorter.

30
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,890
If that's the case how are we going to play again.

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,670
Let's just start by printing.

32
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,740
OK.

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,640
You play again and then.

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,170
Otherwise let's do an else that just says OK goodbye.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,630
Meaning that they typed and or no otherwise there are traps in this line or they're just asked over

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,080
and over again until they type one of these.

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,470
All right I have my Colon's.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
What else.

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,420
Oh this should be in not is in is this for a direct comparison.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,750
We just need in like we had up here.

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,590
Now let's test it.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,310
So let's get it right immediately.

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,980
William Nicholson paste that in.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,880
You got it right.

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,850
Would you like to play again.

46
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's type one of the non answers.

47
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,290
All right.

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,650
Now I'm going to type Y capital Y we play get but of course it's not actually implemented yet.

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,330
So what do we want to happen when we play again.

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,960
We have a lot of we have a bunch of ways of actually doing this.

51
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,390
We could put this entire thing.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,770
All of this in a loop and have a variable called play again like while playing with that playing starts

53
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:03,510
it's true and then down here we can set playing to true or playing to false and start the loop again

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,770
or a different approach that we haven't seen before is to put all of this in a function.

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:20,150
So what can I call that function let's call it def start game and let's say it just takes in a list.

56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,250
Actually let's just call it start game for now that's fine.

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:34,140
Get rid of my wild playing and then indent all of this code all of this is part of start game then what

58
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,940
I'm going to do.

59
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,950
And we haven't really seen this.

60
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,940
If we want to play again we're actually going to call or start game and I'm going to return.

61
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,300
I start game and actually execute it.

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,710
So this remember return is going to end execution at this function.

63
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,890
But by returning this kindness it starts it over.

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:00,820
Exactly what it does and it begins again picks a new quote remain and guesses is reset and we go all

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,490
the way down through this again.

66
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,330
So we don't have to manage nested while loops.

67
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,210
This is just another approach that allows us to restart.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,690
Otherwise we'll print OK goodbye.

69
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,650
And then that's the end of execution.

70
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,630
The only thing we have to do right now because we move this to a function we have to call start game.

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,780
So we'll just put that down here.

72
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,350
Let's see if it works.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,450
OK so let's guess incorrectly and then let's guess Albert Einstein we're getting this correct.

74
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,440
A little hint.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,000
I got it right.

76
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,100
But I'd like to play again.

77
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,820
Yes.

78
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,350
And.

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,920
OK.

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,880
It was the same quote.

81
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,930
Let's just see if that's a fluke.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,660
That's possible if I just copy and paste I'd like to play again.

83
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,580
OK so now gave us a different quote.

84
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,830
So just happened to pick that same one again.

85
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,400
Let's get it correctly.

86
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,600
I'd like to play again.

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,130
Time will tell.

88
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,590
Yes.

89
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,960
Not Marilyn Monroe.

90
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,830
I meant to say J.K. Rowling Rowling whatever it is yes.

91
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,330
This it's a different one by her yes it is to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure

92
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,420
this one is it says tumbled or that couldn't be any easier.

93
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,350
Come on one more time.

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,870
All right.

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,850
We are getting diverse ones.

96
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,840
And let's funk out of here.

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,890
Incorrect.

98
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,310
Well this is not going to help.

99
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,240
Let's play one more time then.

100
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,520
Guess wrong.

101
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,330
Keep guessing wrong.

102
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,880
One more time.

103
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,550
Sorry you ran out of guesses.

104
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,260
Would you like to play again this time.

105
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,010
No.

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,740
And then we're done.

107
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,620
OK.

108
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,190
So that actually is the complete behavior of the game.

109
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,320
Everything works.

110
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,690
We can play again.

111
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,410
We get that correct number of guesses we get the right number of hints.

112
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,530
If you wanted to you could take advantage of this for one of the hints to be more creative.

113
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,410
You could have one hint.

114
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:07,300
They gave both initials using what we've already done and then do another hint that maybe picks the

115
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,860
first line here or a random line out of the description and removes all instances of Marilyn Monroe

116
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,270
or whatever the author's name is.

117
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,730
You can also figure out the number of characters in the first name and the number of characters in the

118
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,790
last name.

119
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,310
Count those up do the same thing.

120
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,310
If we do a split and then you could call Lenn on the two strings and use those and say and print those

121
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,580
out to a user.

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,900
So maybe you can get more creative next let's address this here.

123
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,400
Let's just wrap this in a function called Get quotes or.

124
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,510
Actually it's a scrape of quotes scrape.

125
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:53,250
Def and then indent all this and then return from it.

126
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,220
Let's move all this stuff.

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,420
Well not the base you are.

128
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,440
We are going to need that in conventionally.

129
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,110
We should make this a constant which I'll talk about in just a second.

130
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,240
But let's move all quotes into here and then return all quotes like this.

131
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,400
So then we need to call scrape quotes first down at the bottom right.

132
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,820
There we go.

133
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:26,990
And we want to save the result to a variable let's call it quotes and then past quotes in to start game.

134
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,690
And it doesn't accept any argument so let's make that variable we call that quotes.

135
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,210
So we need to adjust this to the quotes to match that by calling all quotes anywhere else.

136
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,340
Always good to find that next previous.

137
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:45,870
OK.

138
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,070
It's all just inside that function which is fine.

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,410
So we have this here we will need to in the play again function where we return start game need to return

140
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,460
start game with the same list of quotes.

141
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,490
So we're scraping first and then recalling.

142
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,620
Start game with the quotes that we get back from scraping just to make this a bit more modular so we

143
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,260
can scrape separately if we wanted to.

144
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,970
For example in the next video I'm going to show how to update this to work with the CSP file.

145
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,760
We don't want to scrape every single time we might want to scrape once and then load data from a file

146
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,920
and then maybe scrape you know once every week or whenever it manually or we could learn to schedule

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,230
it too.

148
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,610
But that's a whole other thing.

149
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,150
OK.

150
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,750
So back to the base you are.

151
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,170
I'm going to make that.

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,260
It's all caps doesn't make a difference.

153
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,560
It's just to show that it's a constant.

154
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
This isn't supposed to change.

155
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,750
So then where every reference base you RL looks like we have it here.

156
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,160
Select all of them.

157
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,110
Okay.

158
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,630
And just replace them.

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
Base you are out in caps.

160
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,840
Otherwise I think we're good to go until the next video where we refactor things let's just verify it

161
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,280
still works.

162
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,290
Local variable you are referenced before assignment yes.

163
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,520
So you are well is assigned up here and then here I'm accessing while you are.

164
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,180
We just want to add that in here that's associated with scrape quotes.

165
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,680
Make sure it works.

166
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,130
Now OK.

167
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,020
It looks like it's going to work.

168
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,890
Who said this quote George Carlin.

169
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,570
That's correct.

170
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,600
The and just restart.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,750
All right.

172
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,880
Let's see if that works.

173
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,990
Let's quit out of here.

174
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,590
Perfect.

175
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,800
In the next video we'll finish up refactoring this to use cxxviii file so we don't have to scrape every

176
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,070
time and we can get the game going immediately.
