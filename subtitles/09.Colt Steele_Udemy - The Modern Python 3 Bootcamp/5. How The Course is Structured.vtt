00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.440
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.130
This is the last video in this intro section.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.040
After this we dive into the meat of the course but this is still a really important topic.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.990
It's all about not just how I approach online teaching.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
Not some convoluted doctrine about my theory of teaching but it's really about how it relates to your

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.580
learning style and what it means to you as a student.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.280
So let's just get on with it.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.430
Teaching online can be hard you know teaching in general can be hard but going from person to online

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.890
the hardest thing that I struggled with was being able to understand how happy my pace how things were

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.030
going for students in person.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.880
You learn over time that you know look at people's faces and see if they're bored or if they're asleep

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.150
or if they look terrified and they're lost and you also learn to check for understanding which students

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.890
you interact with them you ask them questions to test them.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.510
They ask you questions it's a dialogue online.

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.770
It's just me recording these videos like a crazy person locked up in my room you know with mattresses

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.590
on the walls to keep the sound down.

17
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770
So it's it's different.

18
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.490
So if this is a meter to show from angry to perfectly right down to angry again as far as pacing you

19
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.280
know I could have a student with the same video one exact video on I don't know is the return statement

20
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.000
in Python.

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.360
For some people I might be going too fast.

22
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.010
Other people say you know slow slow way down but they're not quite as frantic.

23
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.040
Someone might be a little lost then maybe one person will say this is just what I needed.

24
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.540
Other people are going to say this is way too slow for me.

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.980
I already know this hurry up.

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.330
You know I'm super super bored.

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.180
One star you suck I hate you it's just awful.

28
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.500
It runs the gamut.

29
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.040
So from my perspective I have to figure out who do I teach to and how do I make this work.

30
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.080
Without sounding too preachy my approach is that I just add a ton of content and I make a lot of it

31
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.790
optional.

32
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.350
It's really all I can do to accommodate everyone.

33
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.020
So if you're somebody who is a really fast learner maybe you already know some of this content and you

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.550
get bored easily.

35
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.010
It's ok to skip things and at the same time if you're somebody who is never program before you need

36
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.990
to take your time.

37
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.210
You know this is new and intimidating to you.

38
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.410
I've added in tons of exercises additional reinforcing material that you can rely on to students might

39
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.360
be at very different levels different paces and different learning styles could have a different experience

40
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.100
in the course even though it's one set of videos.

41
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.910
For example here's some of the content from the function section later on in this course or two sections

42
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.980
actually on functions.

43
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.900
Imagine that you're going through it and you watch the first couple of videos.

44
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.470
You do the first exercise and you feel good about it.

45
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.240
So you can skip the Cotulla.

46
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.340
This is you know I always make it clear in my videos.

47
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.700
I'll say this is optional.

48
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.720
This is skippable.

49
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.550
In this video I'm going to do more of what we did in the last video so you could try the next exercise

50
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.950
and you might skip the next one.

51
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.570
Then you watch more videos.

52
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.720
And then there's a whole problem set.

53
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.500
So for some students they might want to tackle every problem in here.

54
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.200
Usually when i have problem sets I arrange them from easiest to hardest.

55
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.650
So if you're feeling good you might skip the first couple.

56
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.320
You might try the first one realize it's too easy then skip one try another chunk then try the one at

57
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.120
the very end to test yourself.

58
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.220
There's just a lot of flexibility built in.

59
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.680
So I don't want to sound like I'm figured out how to teach all mine better than anyone.

60
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.860
It's not at all the case I'm just trying to tell you how I approach it personally.

61
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.210
I know it's impossible to teach to everybody's style.

62
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.820
People are always going to you know find things that are too fast or too slow for them.

63
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.690
But I encourage you to make it your own.

64
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.790
I've built it that way that you can.

65
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.130
Part of that is how I structure my videos.

66
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.670
So if this represents an average video there's always a goals and objectives section at the beginning

67
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.220
where I talk for 10 15 maybe 30 seconds about where we're going in this video why it matters.

68
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.300
I try and set it in context to explain you know we're going to learn functions.

69
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.430
This is what they are why they should care.

70
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.000
This is how it fits into what we saw yesterday or last section.

71
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.570
Then there's the meat of the video which is you know 80 percent of it.

72
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.090
Most of the content the new material and then a recap or summary at the end.

73
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.750
So I'm telling you this because for some students those are really important sections the recap the

74
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.030
goals and objectives to set the context so that you can kind of position the material in your mind make

75
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.810
a mental map.

76
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.550
But for others it could just be monotonous and slow.

77
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.570
So that's OK you just skip it.

78
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.240
In fact what will probably happen is people will add bookmarks in the videos.

79
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.280
You can see them on the to me video platform where people will bookmark the most important parts of

80
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.920
the video.

81
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.150
And often in my videos people bookmark after the goals and objectives or at the recap so that you can

82
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.640
skip to them or skip away from them if that's your goal.

83
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.230
And lastly if you feel the course is going too slow for you I highly recommend you increase the video

84
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.300
playback speed.

85
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.210
You know me has this as an option or Personally when I watch a lot of tutorials on YouTube or some you

86
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.970
know me courses try to learn after effects right now to make my own animations because oh I don't really

87
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.180
have an animation right now but if I did it would be awful.

88
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.690
So I'm trying to learn that.

89
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.780
But I'd like to turn up the video speed.

90
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.520
It just bothers me to listen to somebody talk slowly and I get that criticism about myself all the time.

91
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.210
But my opinion is that it's best to allow people to me and they want to push them down rather than making

92
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.950
that decision ahead of time and making all the videos very fast or very slow.

93
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.220
So just keep that in mind it's up to you.

94
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.910
You know I know that goes without saying you it's your life you could do it you want.

95
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.460
But I recommend that you speed up the videos.

96
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.460
If you feel like it's going too slow don't allow that to frustrate you.

97
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.850
And same thing if you feel like it's going too fast.

98
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.240
And then also check for your understanding as you go.

99
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.020
Use the exercises that are built in to see if you need to watch every video and a section if you feel

100
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.610
good about functions or lists than don't do every exercise in the list section anyway.

101
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.690
I think I should stop talking now.

102
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.050
There's a lot in this course.

103
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.610
So I just want to make it clear that I'm trying my best to make this as friendly as possible to people

104
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.900
from all different backgrounds and learning styles.

105
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.980
If you like it how it is you can keep it that way.

106
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.800
And if you hate it you can kind of choose your own adventure and bless the you that little kitty in

107
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.990
a sink sinks in for cats.

108
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.060
What is she doing.

109
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.090
All right.

110
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.290
Let's get started.

111
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.320
I'll see you in the next section whichever section you end up picking.
