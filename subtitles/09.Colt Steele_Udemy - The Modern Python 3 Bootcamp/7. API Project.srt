1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,790
OK.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,020
So now that we've seen the basics of making GET requests with the requests package as well as sending

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,860
search parameters or query strings using prims now we have enough information to make a little program

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,010
that does this.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,530
So I called my dad up he Wib it says dad joke 3000 It's the name of our program.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,670
You don't have to do this ascii art with the colors if you don't want to.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,790
But what I do want you to try is ask for a joke.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,260
So give it topic let's do snow maybe.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,510
And then it should print out.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,360
I've got four jokes about snow.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,250
Here's one what did one snowman say to the other snowman.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,170
Do you smell carrot.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,590
So what it does if it gets back.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,150
Multiple results.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,250
Then we're going to pick one at random.

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,310
So you'll need to use the random module as well.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,350
And if we search for something that only gives us one result I think fruit only had one result.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,150
I've got one joke about fruit is.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,780
My wife is on a tropical fruit diet.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,140
House is full of stuff.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,450
It is enough to make a man go mango crazy.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,070
Yeah.

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,880
Terrible.

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:10,260
And then lastly if we search for something that there are no jokes about like that it should say sorry

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,030
I don't have any jokes about it.

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,560
Please try again.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,670
So three different scenarios.

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,290
We get multiple jokes.

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,650
So no matter what you're going to ask the user for input and you're going to send a request to the search

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,430
and point of I Can Has that joke dot com slash search query string term equals whatever the user types.

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,440
Then depending on what we get back you're going to have to make a decision is a conditional and just

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,960
check how many results I get back if results is equal to 1.

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,990
Well if results is 0 and doesn't exist then I don't have any jokes if it's equal to 1 print that joke

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,710
and if it's equal if it's greater than one randomly sample one or choose one from the list and display

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,290
that.

36
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,860
OK.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,030
So give it a shot in the next video.

38
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,690
I'll have a solution when you don't have to do this of course if you just want to watch the solution

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,650
and quote along with me that's also an option.

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,260
So in the next video I will build this.
