00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.590
OK.

2
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.440
So far we've been focusing on navigating the command line moving through folders listing things finding

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.730
our current path.

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.010
Next we're going to focus on manipulating folders and files.

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.920
So we're going to learn how to do things like making new folders new files deleting things moving things

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.490
around renaming them all through the command line.

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.220
And we're going to start off here with a quick video on creating new directories from the command line.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.780
So the magic command is M-K Diyar or make dear stance for sort of stands for make directory.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.540
So M-K Diyar followed by the name of whatever you want the new directory to be called will make that

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.570
new directory in the current folder.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.430
Current directory that you're in.

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.970
So for example if I have a folder called Stuff I want to make a new folder inside of it I can write

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940
make dear cat pics and whatever name I provide there'll be a new directory with that name created inside

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.890
of stuff.

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.920
And if we did Alice after that we would see.

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.480
Now there's a cat pix folder.

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.590
Now if there's anything else in there it also show up.

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.600
But in this example stuff is empty until we add cat pics.

20
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.840
We can see into cat pics and now we've changed into our brand new directory.

21
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.260
We type PWT.

22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.040
What should our path be.

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
SAS users slash call slash stuff slash cat pics.

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.620
And again depending on if for use using Cloud 9 or PC or Mac.

25
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.460
The beginning of this might be a bit different.

26
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.950
But really we're just focusing on the stuff that is unique to this slide.

27
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.880
And honestly that's pretty much all there is to make directory.

28
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.260
So let's try it out now.

29
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.580
I have a new window open in the home directory type LS And let's go to my desktop.

30
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.290
You can see it over here.

31
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.610
And the reason I'm going to use my desktop is that when a new directory is created you'll actually see

32
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.200
it show up over here as well.

33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.000
So you know I'm not just tricking you.

34
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.160
So it's type LS.

35
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.310
I already have cat photos so let's make a new directory m k d DVR and I'll call this one.

36
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.430
Dog photos hit enter.

37
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.330
There it is.

38
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.510
It's kind of annoying that it's not aligned on the grid but if I type ls in my terminal there's now

39
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.020
a dog photos directory.

40
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.840
I can see into dog photos and I type ls.

41
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.700
There's nothing here of course.

42
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.200
Last thing I'll show you is that we can actually create more than one directory at a time.

43
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.290
So let's say instead of dog photos I want it to have photos of my dog Rusty and photos of my dog Wyatt

44
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.030
and I want to folders in there.

45
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.260
I could do rusty picks space.

46
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.420
Why it takes just like this.

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.320
If I hit enter it doesn't look like anything happened we don't get a message but if I type Ellis we

48
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.720
now have two directories and if I also open up dog photos you can see I have two new directories in

49
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.640
there.

50
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.320
So that's it for M-K D-I or make dear.

51
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.680
Hardest part about it is remembering the arbitrary letters m k d.

52
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.600
All right.

53
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.250
Next we'll see how to make files.
