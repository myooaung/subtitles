00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.230
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.630
In this video we're going to look at a command called CD which stands for change directory.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.990
This is how we can move both forward and backwards through our file and folder structure using the command

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.600
line.

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.240
So if we have this same folder structure where we have our root directory and then a user's directory

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.810
and then Colt directory which is the home directory inside of that there's another folder or directory

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.100
called Stuff.

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.800
If I was currently located in this directory which we actually don't know how to do yet because when

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.630
we open a Power Shell we're stuck in the home directory.

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.480
But suppose we were here if I wanted to just double check where I was I could type PWT.

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.400
It tells me user slash called such stuff.

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.870
And when I'm saying slash I do mean backslash on a Mac or a Linux system.

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.040
It actually is a forward slash which is one of the main differences.

14
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.780
So if you do see me typing paths I'll be using forward slashes in most of the course.

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.170
Just know that that should be a backslash for you if you're on a PC.

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:12.140
Anyway I type PWT I get proof that I am indeed in the stuff directory and if I typed CD and then backslash

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.870
users that would take me all the way back change directory into this directory that moves me here and

18
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.600
to verify I could type PWB again.

19
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.830
And I see the path is changed now and users are no longer in stuff.

20
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.800
And that's one way of using CD.

21
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.810
It's called navigating.

22
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.700
Absolutely where I typed the entire path.

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.910
I couldn't just say CD users from here.

24
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.510
I have to say backslash users because that's the absolute path backslash for the root directory then

25
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.760
users.

26
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.630
Same thing with calls.

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.850
I couldn't just go from stuff and say CD colt.

28
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.030
I would have to say CD backslash users backslash colt or what I'm going to show you in the next slide

29
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.670
is an alternative way to navigate relatively using your current position.

30
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.880
So imagine I had the same scenario and users directory called directory stuff directory.

31
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.340
If I'm currently in the stuff directory and I want to go back to the cult directory I don't have to

32
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.850
type CD backslash users slash backslash code I can type a CD dot dot dot dot is a special little command

33
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.970
that just means go back one level one folder every time I type C.D dot dot.

34
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.250
It backs me out one level until I can go no further.

35
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.770
And if I typed PWT again I would now see that users access code.

36
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.750
I'm in the home directory and before I demo this in the power show just recapping to see what's inside

37
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.550
to see the contents of a directory we can use advice.

38
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.150
And it just lists all the contents as well as the last time that they were altered time and date.

39
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.110
Ok now I'm in my power show and we're in our default home directory.

40
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.840
If I type LS to see what folders I have in front of me I see there's a desktop directory.

41
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:14.010
So why don't I change directory into desktop and if I type D or desk and then hit tab and see what happens

42
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.690
for me it actually auto completes it.

43
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.860
Try that again.

44
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.950
C D D in its case insensitive.

45
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.310
So I can do d lowercase i hit tab.

46
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.550
It auto completes to match that folder.

47
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.110
The dot by the way stands for the current directory.

48
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.240
So dot dot means go back one level dot means the current folder and then whatever's in front of it.

49
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:46.030
So slash backslash desktop should take me to a desktop and if I type PWT you can see I am indeed indeed

50
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.090
on the desktop inside of the cold home directory instead of users inside of the root.

51
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.570
And if I type LS there are two folders in here.

52
00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.300
Let's go into the stuff directory if I wanted to I could actually take a peek at what's in there from

53
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.300
outside if I type LS stuff.

54
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.500
And it tells me all right.

55
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.870
It's just a bunch of stuff I moved into there to hide from you and my desk top nothing scandalous just

56
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.740
a bunch of like screencast recording files some random clutter on my desktop at any point.

57
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.770
By the way you can type clear to clear your power show.

58
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.540
I'll do that a lot in the course.

59
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.060
Just as things start to move down and get cluttered.

60
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:37.670
So LS again let's change into Colts code and all I had to do is type C and it hit tab type LS again.

61
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.220
Now I can see there's a single file in there.

62
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.450
So once we learn how to actually run code I mean it's not that hard.

63
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.830
It's just the word python.

64
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.850
And then my code P Y which is the file you probably don't have Python installed yet.

65
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.510
But if you did this would work and this is our bread and butter of course.

66
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.010
We'll edit a bunch of files type of munchy code then navigate to them so find them using CD analysis

67
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.520
and then execute them.

68
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.590
And that's what I get here as we are we've already seen.

69
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.880
So now let's work on going backwards.

70
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.030
I'm currently in Colts code on the desktop.

71
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.360
Let's say I want to just go back to the desktop.

72
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.190
It's just a matter of CD Dadds And now if I type.

73
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.470
I mean you can see the prompt change to show me that if I type PWT I am indeed on the desktop by type

74
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.230
LS.

75
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.010
I have two folders that are on my desktop.

76
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.510
That's it.

77
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.640
I want to go back one level again.

78
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.680
See the DOT DOT I'm now in my home directory.

79
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.890
Slash backslash users backslash Colts type LS Let's go back one level again.

80
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.400
Where will this take me to the users directory.

81
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.970
And one more time.

82
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.940
I am now in the root.

83
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.470
So you probably won't spend much time in your root directory.

84
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.190
But this is what it looks like.

85
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.060
You type PWT.

86
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.270
It just shows S backslash.

87
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.900
That's where we are as a shortcut.

88
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.670
If I wanted to get back to my home directory I could just close the window down and open a new one and

89
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.710
it would automatically be there.

90
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.200
I don't have to do backslash and then users backslash.

91
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.830
My name called.

92
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.390
I can also do cd Tildy that little shortcut we saw and that takes me straight there.

93
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.110
So referencing Tildy always references the home directory and the type of us I'm there.

94
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.390
If I wanted to go back to the root.

95
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.890
Like I said you probably wouldn't want to do this often.

96
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.070
You can do cd backslash and that takes me right there.

97
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.530
I type PWT that's where I am.

98
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.170
So let's go back to the desktop.

99
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.610
Now I have a lot of ways of getting there.

100
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.060
I could see one it and one step at a time.

101
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.000
CD users hit enter CD desktop or CD colt then CD desktop.

102
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.610
I could also do CD and do the entire absolute path slash backslash users backslash Colts backslash desktop

103
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:14.190
and finally I could also do cd till the slash desktop and it auto completed to this so I'll show you

104
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:21.010
amortise CD till the slash desktop hit tab and it auto fills it in.

105
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.900
And now I'm on the desktop.

106
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.060
OK so I know it's been a whirlwind.

107
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.210
If you are new to this in my experience it takes students a little while.

108
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.060
At least my in-person students takes them a while to get comfortable using the command line especially

109
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.790
if they've never used it before.

110
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.370
So just take some time and explore your own file structure on your own.

111
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.210
You probably have a lot more files on your computer than I do.

112
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.110
I don't really use this pc very much mainly for recording this sort of this type of video.

113
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.380
To be honest so it will be more exciting for you to follow.

114
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.620
You know look your own files and folders and explore what happens then after this.

115
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.680
There's a quick quiz.

116
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.790
The whole goal is just to make sure that you're comfortable using these commands and then we have a

117
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.210
couple more commands just to and then we're done and we move on to Python.
