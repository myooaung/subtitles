00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Hello,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.020
dear guys will come to the second part of my education.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.240
We're going to do the rest of the work.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.530
Uh,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.790
we should magnify our project.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.850
So we have two ways we can use crop tool to magnify it as far as we want.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:37.450
And ah,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.020
we can do Do it in another way.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.540
We can use control all sea or command option and seeing Mac operating system.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.270
And after that,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.000
click on these key to let finish up software.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.550
Know that you wanna resize it from the top to bottom.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.870
The convents extension color should be white.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.680
The rich street being 90 20 end.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.560
The height should be for 1000 pixels.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.390
See,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.030
the website has been magnified on our Grandjean has been changed to We should double click

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.750
on the grade Ian's layer and then we must decrease this scale.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.680
Okay,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.960
Very good.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.950
And dragged up.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.630
No.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.420
Now I should add a ruler to the previous rulers to know very should being to design the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.550
rest of work.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:54.140
Select new guide from view menu.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.870
Ah,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.700
and select reason Tall mark,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.610
Then set position as 10.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.490
80.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.200
It sits the ruler Exactly on 10.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.690
80 here.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.970
I mean,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.750
here and it shows that we should continue from here.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.490
We can use several ways to create these part.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.160
For example,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.150
we can reshape the rectangle,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.850
and so I change it.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.050
Who in order Shape?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.700
Actually,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.480
it's the most simple Wayans Sander degree.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.630
Or actually,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.640
you can draw another shape and put it in a project I preferred.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.950
Teoh reshaped the rectangle at the first.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.250
We should put the same age in the shape,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.940
and then we should mention the effects of it.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.050
We should create them.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.450
I keep pressing on old Key.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.010
After that,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.180
I'll click between the layers as you see old effects,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.550
and the team age has been transferred to the rectangle.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.460
Now we can use our pen tool to insert a point exactly at the central image.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.580
You can find the center of image by your ruler,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.670
but it's not necessary because the software shows it automatically.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.660
Let me zooming,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.990
See if I inserted here.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.850
The software will design and new undesirable shape for me.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.350
I want to at a point to my main shape,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.590
so I should use path selection tool to set these,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.350
uh,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.900
layer in the selection mode.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.220
See,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.350
it has been said in the solution month.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.580
Now,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.450
a chance at a point on it,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.620
then,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.150
uh,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.450
I should used direct selection to to move the point C.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.620
It has sick you'll or mud.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.850
See?

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:34.340
Very good use controls at to convert E.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.100
Yes.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.960
Converted.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.050
It controls it.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.220
Now,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.090
we have two ways we can select this point to move it down,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.150
or we can select these two points to move them up.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.700
There is no difference feeding these to raise because they'll have same result for us.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.920
If you move these point,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.610
the quarter will show this part too.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.050
But if you move these two points,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.550
uh,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.270
these two wide parts will be shut down.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.190
Actually,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.050
it's desirable.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.440
Uh,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.590
I select this phone to move it down.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.380
Okay.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.830
So the white parts won't be shown.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.800
Actually,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.150
it's curved.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.050
Mm.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:42.510
You can keep pressing on old key or option in micro grading system to move up these points

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.050
in order to align it.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.950
Yeah,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.850
very good.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.300
Very good.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.260
And move up the swan to readout ology.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.580
Moving up.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.190
Readout ology.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.250
Use old kid to move to move up the 1st 1 and move up the 2nd 1 without all key.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.860
Uh,

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.750
you see,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.320
we could design these part easily.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.020
Now you should select the Ah Laos layer.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.930
I mean background to design a shape on it.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:34.990
You must set the weeks as 90 20 900.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.030
Pick sells for the height of it.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.660
Yes.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.770
Set 900.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.450
Peak sells for the height of it.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.530
Very good.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.440
Said height as 900 pixels.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.220
Sorry.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.450
Repeating a lot.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.190
Well,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:07:04.230
move it up and change the color to white or set gray color to know how much work is pace

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.050
you have.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.650
You can select one of the coronaries.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.350
I mean,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.810
one of these points,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:24.300
we direct selection tool and keep pressing on shift key and used arrow keys to move it down

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.650
about several pig cells.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.210
Click on yes,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.960
key and use shift and down Arrow key.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.790
Two movie down.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.860
Actually,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:46.090
you can create a granny in here by doing this work.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.640
Well,

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.950
I designed it.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.830
Uh,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.500
now we should take a copay of it to create the next part,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:04.750
said it here and change it into pink used pink color to cholerae eight movie to lower

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.650
layers.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.100
It has been sit exactly like has the main mole.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:19.550
I do the same work for the lower 12 I transferred to lower layer and then I'll change it,

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.800
uh,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.200
to purple.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.490
Yes.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.580
Used purple color for now.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.830
I color them for now in order to show my workspace in the project.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.650
Other first,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.960
I save it.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.180
Uh,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:47.370
I said it on site for I say,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.550
as site for uh Okay.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:57.850
Now we should design these part under first.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.850
I opened my browser.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:06.350
Seen I used a pattern in these part and somehow,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.370
uh,

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.260
using all around the website.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.950
Not all the parts.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:12.750
Exactly.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.680
Yes,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.560
some parts.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.840
Uh,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.640
we can use it everywhere.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.980
See,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.320
we can use the pattern.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.070
A river that we like.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.770
It's upon this part c.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:30.050
We used adjustments and we mask them in each order.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.710
I mean,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.320
these features have been masked in these main layer.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.250
We can select this layer and select these pattern for eat and use this pattern for eat.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:51.330
Then we should set this scale as to 15 is too much.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.350
I think five,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.850
as I said to is a suitable number.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.900
See,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.720
now we have a pattern here.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.420
Very.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:14.250
We can do the same for for the lower layer on and then mask it.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:21.840
Keep pressing old key and used right click beeping the layers and select sleeping mask

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.780
option from here.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.640
Very good.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:33.630
Now we should decrease the opacity as far as we won't.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.400
For example,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.250
thirties is treatable.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.540
Lumber.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.100
Freight?

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.600
Yes.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.130
Thirties.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.560
Okay.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.360
Or than 40?

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.990
Yes,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:47.490
40 z it Now I can transfer the image off iPhone X to the project.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.670
I said it here.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.490
Now.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.350
I should change the wallpaper off the cell phone.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.660
And the first,

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.650
uh,

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.670
let me set it.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.270
Very good.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.250
Uh,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.620
now,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.560
uh,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.920
I should change the wallpaper of the first.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.800
I should inactivate my rulers to change it.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.950
And then I am asking the rectangle.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.700
I mean this layer rectangle five,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.450
we can use a cook selection tool.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.500
Onda,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.140
decrease the size of it.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:38.660
Okay.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:46.430
Used quick selection tool to decrease the size of it and use it to select it.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.350
Desirable part.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.880
Very good.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.650
Now we should use so lead color layer.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.880
Ah,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.850
for these part,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:05.650
we can use any color deathly life.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.410
As you see,

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.250
these parts are in perfect.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.170
See,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:20.850
we should keep pressing on old key and click on Maskell layer to select all of it.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.900
Yeah.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.510
See,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.570
these parts aren't in perfect.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.560
So as I said,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.720
keep pressing on old key and click on mass.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.110
Clear To select all of it with resuming now,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.880
we must slicked expand option,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.120
uh,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.520
from select menu.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:55.260
And we order it to move the selection tool about one pixel toward outside Vary it.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:55.990
Now.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:01.580
We should click on mask layer and use white color on these parts.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:07.710
We can use our color bucket to do it,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.700
using unnecessary parts,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.800
used control or command d to be selected.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.540
And now we can,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.050
uh,

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.610
mask any image in the phone.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.860
Yes.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.850
Let's do it.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:46.590
Select in age and keep pressing on old key and drag it on solid color layer to take a copy

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.100
of it.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.150
Yes.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.150
Take a copy of it.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.490
Move it down.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.000
Okay.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.570
Now mask it in the cell phone.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.650
Very good.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:03.220
Inserting there can use a grading adjustment for this one,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.700
too.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.870
I take a copy of it and dragged here.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.050
After that,

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.650
I'll mask it.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.040
Let me do it.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.700
Yes,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.050
said it.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.570
Here,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.490
mask it.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.940
Okay.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.870
Now I should move the Grandin's.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.340
Okay.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.850
Decrease the scale to 15.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.210
Very good.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:35.660
You can use a new exposure adjustment for it I selected from here.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.120
I should slaved.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.900
Ah,

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.450
the mask.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.990
Okay,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.980
Dark it by gum.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.300
A handle and make it light from here.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.530
Okay,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.040
Very good.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.520
It's my desirable color.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.550
I select all of these layers,

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:06.550
and then I'll use right click to convert them to a smart object.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.190
Now,

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:15.850
I have a single layer that I emerged all of those features in it.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.250
See?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.540
See?

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.100
Okay.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.830
We can rename it to iPhone X ray.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.990
Name this layer toe iPhone,

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.570
Eakes.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:37.250
I can mask it in lower layer to now.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.010
We should work on these image.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.090
We can take a copy of it.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.650
Read old key and movie down.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.550
Okay.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.110
On a mask.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:56.650
It here mass getting the Slayer movies and set it under the pattern layer.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.120
Okay.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:07.710
And use control T on select flip horizontal mood to Senate.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.660
Arise it.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.940
Very good.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:17.850
Now we should decrease the opacity of it as far as we want.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:25.220
We can change the mode to luminosity wherever.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:25.600
Good.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.590
Very good.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.490
Actually,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.410
it arm,

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.990
it's the color of work.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:38.270
Now it's better this I feel that my pattern is richly colored,

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.180
so I decrease the opacity of it.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.090
Okay.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:52.310
I think 30 is a good number way we could design this shapes up to now.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.370
Now we should use,

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.150
uh,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.460
actually,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.350
we should design these two circles.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.590
Uh,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.970
we can use Ellipse tool to draw them.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:30.360
It's the on field part and city has no color and use purple color to color the stroke.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.690
Very good.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.440
Yes,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:40.050
we can change the thickness from here.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:51.600
Said it as two pixels is said to pick cells for the thickness of it.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.950
It's good.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:54.920
Well,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:02.050
we should select both iPhone and the circle layers to set them exactly at a centrally

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.660
charter.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.400
Now,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:05.910
you can,

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.660
uh,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:13.640
take a copia off the circle to mask it in the lower layer and then use control T and keep

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.920
pressing on old key and shift key two minute fight.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.420
Keep pressing an old and chief keys and use control T to unified.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.050
So we design it.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.290
I feel that I should decrease the opacity of circles.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.240
I said 75% for both of them.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.320
Now we should use pen tool to design these line.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.930
I activated by clicking on PT.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.350
I set a point here.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:59.180
Then I keep pressing on shift key and I sit another point and then I'll do the same word to

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.110
create the other lines.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.290
Very good.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.480
Well,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.910
we could design it on.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.660
We should decrease the opacity to 75.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.930
You create a circle here,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.470
use Alex tool to dried.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:23.130
If I use shift key when I want to draw it,

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.850
it will be attached to these shape.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.450
So at the first,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:36.550
you should draw the circle and then use shift key to draw it a regularly.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.980
Actually,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:46.320
the software considers in new layer for the shape I go to Shea.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.460
Part two,

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:54.330
Caller the circle and then I'll sit stroke as no color mud.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.940
Very good.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.720
I said no color.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.450
Very good.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.500
Ah,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.760
decrease the opacity to 75.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.870
Now we should create the text.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:21.920
We can select alarm Ipsum Onda paragraph layers to drag them down.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.120
Okay?

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.580
And we should set them above the iPhone X layer.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.050
Then we should mask them.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.090
Okay,

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.700
So very good.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:53.180
And now you can drag it down from these parts at the first sited here mass scale.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.880
And now you can drag it down.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.770
The sparked driving to the store.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.950
Very good.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:13.540
You can use any color you like or set 333 as the color.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.460
Could I select learn ipsum to set color.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.740
Could Fareed.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.500
Okay,

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.010
I said,

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.720
the color cut,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.150
Fareed.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.480
You can color the paragraph by these color.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.060
Could.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.350
Actually,

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:38.480
it's 555 She leads up to dork that.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.700
Okay,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.520
well,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:49.220
we can drag the image two words left in order to make a distance between the climber and

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.050
the text.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.950
And now,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.280
uh,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.850
we can magnify it in these three.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.160
Okay,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.770
we down a little.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.200
Okay.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.850
You should use text tool,

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.950
uh,

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.870
to add another paragraph here.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.440
Magnified a text box.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.200
Used controller command A and control or command.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.490
See to take a co pay off the text and pace it here.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:26.950
Then you should use control enter to close the text.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.360
Very.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:36.450
But we can move them to reach our desirable a style.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.980
We can align the paragraph.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.180
We learn.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.420
It's,

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.400
um very good.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.190
Yes,

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.880
that's it.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.050
Okay.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.950
Drag it here.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.660
All right.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.910
Uh,

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.850
we can take a co pay off these circle and movie here.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.140
Very good.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.350
Then we can unify it.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.040
Let me zoom.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.400
Mean Okay,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.770
now press in turkey.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:10.390
Very good.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.050
We could create the second parts.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.260
Very good.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.370
Yes.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:24.350
So we could create these parts successfully.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.920
See you soon in the next part.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.050
Good luck.
