00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.210
Hello.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.750
Guys will come to the fourth part off my education.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.700
You're going to designed to Fu during these part of the first,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.140
uh,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.050
we should select lease layer.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.750
After that,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.450
we should drag the image to the sport.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.500
Okay,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.450
let me do it.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.950
Okay,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.080
Eric,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.150
I should magnify it a little.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.340
And now I click on inter.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm ask it in this layer.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.800
I mean rectangle five cookie,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.190
too.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.660
See,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.680
uh,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.950
are you started here?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.080
Now you can smooth these part in several ways.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.920
Off course.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.130
If you don't like these a beveled,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.650
for we can use crop tool to magnify the website.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.090
See?

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.800
Okay,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.670
uh,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.940
now we can click on in Tricky.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.650
And let me take it out.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.560
Very it.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.220
Erica,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.050
I select this layer to set a Philip vertical mud for eat,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.150
and then we should set Philip Reason tall meant for it.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.050
See,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.670
on a first.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.370
Philip vertical,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.040
then Philip Horizontal.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.280
Very good.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.370
Then,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.250
uh,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.570
we have another way.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.680
Alternatively,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.350
we can act a ruler on these layer.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.650
See,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.550
it has snapping,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.030
murdered,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.030
and the software will stick it to these realistic the ruler to the sport.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.610
Automatically use,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.250
uh,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.450
direct selection tool and use shift key at the same time.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.120
Okay.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.700
Use direct selection tool and use Chief at the same time to insert these point under roller

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.700
.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.750
There is no difference between these two ways.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.220
You can use any way that you like.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.460
I can omit the rulers with control at your command edge.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.120
Now,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.540
we should change the mode of image to luminosity mud.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.130
Very good.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.950
See,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.350
we have to change the color of these layer to white.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.690
Or we can sit this collar for it.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.020
I mean,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.250
we can black it.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.240
The color coding is six.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.970
A six a six a.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.480
Okay,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.450
uh,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.590
now should select in age layer to decrease the opacity again.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.380
Machine select rectangle to too dark,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.880
the image a little.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.960
Then we should select the angel a year to decrease the opacity.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.580
Actually desirable.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:04:01.550
So now we should draw three circles in these part.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.400
You can use shift key to magnify or,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.500
um,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.850
unify it and you can use space key to move it.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.070
All right,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.350
get I should create three circles here.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.820
Okay?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.750
Now,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.910
I should select a lips and background layers in order to insert the shape of the central.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:39.370
These part you take O p of this layer by old key and moving left by left arrow key.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.350
I did the same work again,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.130
but I move.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.150
It's right.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.270
Hey,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:58.190
now we can make this sand speaking them.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.990
It's better to set them based on the rollers.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.950
Mm.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.260
Use your rulers to Voreqe.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.120
Uh,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.250
more better.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.140
Very.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.550
But Harry Uh,

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.580
yes,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.640
very sick.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.150
It here very are inserted there.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.340
I don't need the rulers for now.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.150
It's time to mask the e mais in the circles.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.580
You should insert it in this layer.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.750
Let me bring it.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.090
Yes,

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.750
we should be inserted in these layer.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.760
Set your mouse,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:57.280
beading the layers and keep pressing on old key toe up like sleeping mask Option We can

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280
magnify or identified by control t to insert it exactly in the circle.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.360
Very good.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.860
We should do the same work again with a different image.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.940
Let me bring the e mais to the sport.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.280
Let me transferred.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.830
Very zero is here.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.850
So,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.820
uh I magnified and,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.400
uh,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.190
then my click on in turkey.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.540
And now I should apply sleeping mask option for these one.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.250
Okay,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.270
Now we can take your free of it.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:51.690
Read control J in order to design and Nutter Circle in these sports.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.950
Okay,

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.150
unified weed control T and insert it here.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.350
We can mask these image in it.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.490
Very good.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.130
Unify it.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.830
Very good.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.730
Unify to show it better now we should,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.910
uh,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.620
color the circle.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.480
It's desirable.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:25.050
We can use these color The color curry's 40 to 63 f zero.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:44.110
Uh,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.870
let me zooming to sheet.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.480
Better see,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.940
we should sit Stroup around the circles we can created in several ways silicon these layer

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.390
and press you key to activate shape to now.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.350
You can set this route from here.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.550
Let me.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.840
Yes.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:16.150
From here you can set any color that you like and control the thickness from here.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.520
I said no color mood for it.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.700
Way can sit this certain in another way.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:31.900
Double click on this layer and activated its troops from here and increased the size of it

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.630
from here.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.060
And decrease the rapacity as faras.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.760
You won't.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.410
We have to do this same war for these phone to you.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:46.230
Select this layer.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:53.390
Then keep pressing on old key and drag f X to insert it on this layer.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.600
Very good.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.940
Excellent.

You could applied easily.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:08.040
We can use a right click on the layer,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:14.590
which has the effect and select Cokie Layers tile option.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.080
Okay,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.720

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.460
Well,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.250
now click on these layer,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.020
which has no effect,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.190
and then select paste layers.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.550
Tile option.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.040
See,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.360
the fact has been applied easily.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.210
We can use the same way to apply.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.760
It is through for these circle,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.150
too.

Double click under layer and check this Duke,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.870
Use the color off circle to color to suit,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.880
but make it light.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.450
Okay,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.340
Increase the capacity to 100.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.970
And now you should click on in turkey.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.880
Very good.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.860
We could create our website up to these parts successfully.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.520
We can take a copy of these text and use old T and,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.220
uh,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.020

As I said,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.640
you should drag it here.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.110
Change the color to gray light gray color will make it more beautiful.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.740

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.270
If you darch,

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:00.970
it's more.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.490
Actually,

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.190
the color could ease a three a three a three day.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.760
Now we can meet,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.470
uh,

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.150
one of the paragraphs,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.650
and,

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.140
uh,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.240
