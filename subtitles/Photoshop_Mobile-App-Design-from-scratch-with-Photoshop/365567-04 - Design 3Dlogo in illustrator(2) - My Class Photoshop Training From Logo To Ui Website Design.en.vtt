00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
Well,

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.550
as I told you,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.550
uh,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.850
we're going to work with three D menu.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.910
We learned to create our low going illustrator software,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.100
and we learn to form it in for the shop software.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.380
And actually,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.750
we learned to work with actually s styles.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.010
I mean,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.850
we learned about this tiles.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.920
We could design that bowel.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.730
And now we're going to change our logo to three D style.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.080
I mean,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.980
we're going to create a three D logo.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.510
So,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.550
uh,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.370
I should take the Kobe off my logo from illustrator software in order to pay seating for

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.450
the shop software.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.270
Okay.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.150
Okay.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.290
And I,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.840
uh,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.650
said these diamond in the PS Okay,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.950
I said it with arrow keys.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.960
Uh huh.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.150
Okay.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:19.700
Should magnify both layers by control.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.330
T Yes.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.340
You can select every object you like by pressing control T onda,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.680
uh,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.820
dragging the most from the outside of the background.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.380
Actually.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.450
See you guys other first should select your workspace.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.750
And I chose three D because of the project.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.930
And as you see,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.620
we have some work spaces on these pork.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.750
And actually,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.340
Attlee will ask you that.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.760
Do you want to change your workspace or not?

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.940
Off course,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.200
when you're working in another work space and whenever you want to change your object into

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.050
three days sail and remember that you should click on Yes,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.750
in In the answer of the question Well,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.760
my workspace is a three D.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.770
I chose,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.660
uh,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:32.550
actually one off my layers and actually select these option in three D menu,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.250
uh,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.270
see?

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.350
Selected.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.350
Well,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.740
my object has been changed into three.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.210
Emma,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.310
and see,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.060
uh,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.890
we,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.560
uh,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.750
return it,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.260
uh,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.740
way should return to the layer layer tap and silicon shape,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.210
too.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.050
And we'll do the same work for the shape,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.480
too.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.980
And it has been changed in three D mood.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.800
As you see,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.750
each one has been changing to three D More separated Lee.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.490
Let me show it.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.070
Clearly,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.980
as you see,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.030
we have two layers here.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.450
I mean,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750
the speak ps and these diamond.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.670
Actually,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.700
we should marge them on each order.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.950
If you want to move them,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.570
as I said,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.670
we should mourn him on each border.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.130
If you want to move them and wash them by one camera on and,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.630
uh,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.110
just set them by a single setting.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.460
And we can't do suckle og when we have two separated layers,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.700
so I keep pressing on control T and then I'll select both off the layers.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.350
Actually,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.740
you can use control your command e to march to these two layers on each order.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.350
And now they're connected.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.810
Uh,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.720
we can,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.380
and the camera will be moved to show both off them.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.620
Now see both off.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.680
The objects will be moved if we wanna rotate them.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.710
Lively's so like this won't press shift key to select this,

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.740
uh,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.150
to move both off them at the same time.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.100
Okay with me,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.880
sir,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:39.050
do these when you want to move the object and no need to selling them if you want to move

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.610
the camera because they've been connected and it's enough to rotate the camera.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.350
Okay,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.110
Okay.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.820
We use controls at to set it up as a default mood.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:04.130
And now it's time to add the effects of my logo on and move the ports in order to complete

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.140
the project.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.960
The first I rotated a little and then I'll click on these PS to select it.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:20.970
Or you can do this work from here in order to move these PS by these arrows that you see,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.400
uh,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.170
I'm dragging it back and forward on zit axis,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.470
and I can drag it up and down,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.240
actually.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.750
See,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.430
I can drag it up and down on why Axis by these outer.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.060
Actually,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.030
I turned bag with controls.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.100
It also we can drag it right and left on the X axis by these red arrow.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.090
Even you can rotate it freely without using these three arrows.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.890
My friends,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.970
you can do the same work for the offer.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.260
PS two.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.890
You can select it by most or from this part,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.050
and,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.710
uh,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.160
move it like as I do see?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.380
Okay,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:25.400
I pull out these PS on the first.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.150
Uh,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.250
we should magnified by zooming in.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.110
You can zoom in and zoom away by priests by pressing hold key.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.050
And it's curling the most towards four AM back.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.150
See,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.130
uh,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.350
I can do it now,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.710
but it zooms in and zooms out on my project,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.960
Not my object.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.690
Somehow it zooms on a usual,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.650
uh,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.550
photo.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.130
I don't like it.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.070
Let me sit.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.230
These many here.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.920
Well,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.450
uh,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.390
we have several ways to magnify our object.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:09.170
Long make and keep close or camera with the object.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.290
Or we can magnify the object.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.110
Uh,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.120
you can select these two layers by pressing control key.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.750
And then so,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.000
like these core,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.670
which is used to scale magnify and men if I selected and drag it,

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.740
see,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.370
the object is being magnified and magnified like this.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.440
Also,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.650
you can keep close your camera with the object.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.590
Okay,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.490
uh,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.510
you can see that we have some settings for our object.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.740
If you pay attention,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.400
one of them is zoom the three D camera as you see over here,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.710
and I click on the camera,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.310
and then I can get close to my object by dragging the most.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.130
Actually,

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.790
it's just show biz that's going to show us in normal view.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.710
But if you want to create perspective,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.460
stay.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.080
You should use these camera and these option,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.280
which is beside it.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.360
These a slight three D camera option.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.250
See,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.930
you can use just a camera to zoom in and zoom out Lively's.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.550
But these option works in another racy.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:28.650
It hasn't special asylum when you zoom in and zoom out and that he's perspective style.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.990
See,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.450
uh,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.040
it is very special when you,

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.750
uh,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.790
use these two options together.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.370
These work create the crisp activist style.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.250
Of course.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.240
Actually,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.140
you can do.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.580
Eat.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.070
Uh,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.650
actually,

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.050
you can do these war if it is necessary.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.580
But if not you 10 years.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.180
Just a camera.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.200
Okay.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.680
So Ah,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:12.720
I can use controls at to turn it back to the original to convert it to the orginal mood.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.670
Okay,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:21.080
let me magnify it on.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.420
See,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.900
this option leads you to move this cream.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.320
See,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.170
it moves both background and the object,

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.350
and it won't change your lens at all.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.350
See?

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.970
Okay.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.050
These options or taste your object.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.330
Ah,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:53.410
this one is the first born which we used to show the object completely.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:10:01.450
So you can use them to select on appropriate place for your object.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:07.970
I can magnify for now.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.370
Very good.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.090
I should drag it inside.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.570
Not to be like this.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:20.090
It's good of the first.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.060
We should decrease the diameter.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.250
All of the object.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.240
Each layer has special setting options.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.960
You can see by clicking on each layer off.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.870
Three D tap.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.650
One of them is depth.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.350
Uh,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.250
you can use these handle to decrease or increase the diameter.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.300
All the object C.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:53.780
These second shape is more thicker than the 1st 1 Um,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:01.430
you can decrease it to actually,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.110
I want to increase the diameter and make it like hands.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.050
The main model.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.170
Let me see it.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:16.040
Mm.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.850
Good.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.560
Actually,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.320
I want to apply a lot of the fee shares.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.450
Uh,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.700
and you should do that too.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:35.170
The top part isn't obvious completely.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.970
And I do it for this one too.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.590
Very good.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.820
But,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.580
uh,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.850
we should war Kurnit a lot.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:49.900
Let's create thes march for the both shapes.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.350
Okay,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.250
Kilic on the first shape.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.310
Yeah.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:02.750
Try to set these march on the first Kilic on the first shape.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.350
Ah,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.510
it gives you some taps,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.780
Onda.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.890
Actually,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:17.200
we should use a chap tab to create the borders.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.460
Yeah,

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.390
let me explain about these 12 The first option is dip,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.190
uh,

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.880
actually decreases and increases the diameter.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.260
Uh,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.570
on the the next one of these two east,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.280
which rotates the object like a drill press machine.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.350
I said it on the zero.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:51.050
The next one he's taper get Ah,

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.370
actually,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.260
it creates a perspective side for our object.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:05.050
It can drag all of the ports towards in and out.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.780
It's luck here,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.740
shield now actually like these,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.170
it's up to you and your project.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.780
You can use it if you want.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.850
I set it up in the default mood.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.000
Actually,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.550
it was 100.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:27.980
And also,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.950
we can use these two handles to change the logo.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.760
Let me show on these phone.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.980
Actually.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.750
Ah,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:43.550
it changes the logo into a D friend shape.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:14:01.750
Well Oh,

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.950
okay.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:09.200
See,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.420
let me share it.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.330
Actually,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.550
it changes the logo into a different shape.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.360
Actually,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.900
the swarm,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.380
uh,

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.890
is there a regional mood?

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.750
I set it up as 20 c.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.840
It inclines are object like these.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.930
And if,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.080
uh with the increased this number,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.360
it will be rotated like this.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.480
And it really like a cruise.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.040
Actually,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.680
the crews that has the diamond in it.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.780
I mean,

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.710
the small PS and whatever we increase the number,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.350
it will be much more like a cruise.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.820
Look at this style of it.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.500
See,

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.700
it can create an interesting model for us,

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.740
like youthful Cruz,

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.250
teacher glass and etcetera.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.660
Uh,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.890
I said it about zero,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.550
actually.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.790
Ah,

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.550
part why is like part X.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.370
Somehow,

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.930
whatever I increase the normal handle,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.420
we'll bring up my logo.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.050
Okay.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.810
Just the y axis.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.650
Has these actually feature See,

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:41.790
I set it up.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.650
Uh,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:49.750
is 200 c Actually,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.280
I set it up Zero.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.920
Okay.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.680
Actually,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.030
we don't need these menu for these projects.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.310
You step on cap menu.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:03.930
This option leads you to show your local from the front side,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.950
back side or both.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.300
It depends on you.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.670
If you wanna render it from the other parts,

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.540
you should choose both.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.750
But,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.680
uh,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.120
here we just need to show it from the front side.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.350
Okay?

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.370
And actually,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.360
this morn,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.140
I mean,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.690
these options helps you to create the counter.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.150
I mean the border.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.770
And,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:35.140
uh,

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.830
after you choose it,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.050
you have to set a number here.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.480
Uh,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.560
let me set a number for weeks of it.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.500
Okay?

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:51.510
I think forties enough.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:56.380
And and so,

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.200
like the shapes you like.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.960
It is exactly like as a main model.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.580
These option has various models.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:13.250
We get the counters and actually,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:19.230
you can kill You found the model to design your desirable shaped like these I click on.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.980
OK,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.270
let me the first that created Really?

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.050
I click on OK.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:29.480
Yes.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.000
It's what I want.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.520
We used these Shea for the main model.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.480
I think forties enough about its width.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.710
No matter what number you said,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.050
just the designing is important.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.420
We do the same work,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.190
Uh,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:52.270
for the lower ps two selected and choose a desirable shape.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.140
Actually,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.280
I used,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.760
uh,

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.490
least phoning the main model we selected.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:03.760
And then we should set it up as 30 or even more,

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.190
As you see.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.870
Ah,

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.850
the lower PS is in a serious in the main model,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:17.120
but in these sworn it is punched.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.130
As you see Onda up here,

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:26.410
we learned how we can create a three D hollow mean hole,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:32.520
and we're going to make it in a serious uh,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.480
Now,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.990
let's work.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.790
It's like as the,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.000
uh shape which we worked on it.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.040
And it has many,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.720
uh,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.310
actually same features.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.360
And because of that,

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.460
we set the radio on the fast motion mood,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.950
and we'll work on the different part of it is slowly.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.680
Well,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.100
I take a copia of PS,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.450
and then I pasted here,

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:08.220
let me with me.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.660
Okay.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.160
Okay.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
Uh,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.100
I take your copia vida than I'll pass it here.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:18.950
Now,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.140
uh,

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.220
I dry square here.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.950
I rotated with control t to turn it into a diamond.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.450
I set it up here here,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.440
huh?

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:40.760
Shit up here.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.900
Uh,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.550
I write a PS year by pressing,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.580
uh,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.260
on Tiki.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.210
Actually,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.440
these peers has been written with capital letters.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.270
And it's just because off,

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.950
uh,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.250
activated these effect in character port.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.980
So I inactivated.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.080
See?

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.750
Now it's like as the main model guys,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:12.380
I rotated me control T and by pressing shift key.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.700
Okay,

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.220
See,

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.350
they're like Is each other use control?

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.050
T and my pressing shift key?

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.850
You can rotate it.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.290
Let me check the dean stances.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.260
Okay,

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.060
I'm unified.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.180
Okay,

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.760
It's ready now.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:46.730
I magnify the gain we have.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:47.410
It's ready now.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.860
We have three layers here.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.200
We saw it from the PS in order to turn it into three demoed.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.260
We select these option in three D Minya and,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.090
uh,

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.160
okay,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.920
then I keep pressing on control key and click on Diamond Layer to change it into three d

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.210
more to actually buy path option.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.920
And we should do the same word with these PS two.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.010
Well,

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:17.730
then I select all of the layers.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.050
I mean,

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:24.920
all the three layers in order to margin him on each order or somehow we teach order.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.700
Uh,

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.260
you can,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.050
uh,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.520
connect them together.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.620
We'd command or control e.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.900
And now I have a shape one retaining the lawn and PS in these parts.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.720
I drag out the PS in order to show it off.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.300
Okay,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.210
I do the same work about the rectangle one.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.050
Uh,

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.160
good.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.670
Let me rotate the background to see,

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.850
uh,

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.920
how easy it Oh,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.680
drag.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:17.850
It ain so we could design the slugger up to here somehow,

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.240
and,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.700
uh,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.250
you can change the view of camera.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.290
It depends in you.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:27.800
It's time to work on the materials and coloring these three D logo.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.580
Well,

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:34.120
the PS is shaved one.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.950
As you see,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.030
we have some materials for fun.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:38.770
Side,

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.150
back,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.390
side and extraordinaire,

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.260
part as you see on this screen.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.060
Ah,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.830
by sending them I mean,

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:59.060
I select the mall and by clicking on one off them and keep pressing on shift key.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.540
Yes,

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.160
click on one of them and keep pressing on shift key.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.470
I d.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.730
Then I step on material ports to select one of these materials in for the shop.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.130
Softer.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:21.570
Here you can any these materials or don't love some materials from Internet or even you can

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.950
create a material OK,

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.980
It's not so difficult.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.330
We can choose one of them and change the colder bomb.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:31.980
I don't know,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.230
effect brightness and etcetera.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.050
Uh,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.700
I usually swan,

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:59.280
and I set it up on the logo A C Now we should set the golden color for the bevel.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.090
She said a color for both.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.390
Front side and back side of battle.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.270
Okay,

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.860
uh,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.220
I select both of them,

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.350
and then I select golden color for them.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:22.920
I think it's OK with me with me.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.570
I should,

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.450
uh,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.410
said the golden caller from here?

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:30.950
Yes,

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.750
as you saw.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.730
So cure everything.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:34.070
Yeah,

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.370
And I should keep the code of these color.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.720
Let me round the numbers and the sport.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:50.190
100 on 40 141 115.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.260
Okay,

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:59.480
Other first we should select front and back bevel in rectangle part.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.850
Then we should set up the blue material for eat.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.380
And then we set up the previous numbers.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.170
No.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:28.230
Then I cynic these three ports to set up the same material luxuries.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:34.280
Then we'll do the same work on the PS by selecting all of them.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.710
Okay.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.950
Uh,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.140
yeah.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.560
Uh,

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.680
OK.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:50.260
Now it's time to use gold color on the upper level over the PS.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.140
I go to these part to select PS frond,

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.260
and then I set up the same color on it.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.860
Okay.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.340
Uh huh.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:07.850
Let me set the previous numbers.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.450
Okay,

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.980
Uh,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.490
let me change the color over it.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:26.330
So let me change the color off the march of PS.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.160
I do it by selecting front and back people in the rectangle part.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.790
Then I set up this same color,

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.050
are used on it.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.630
Okay,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.430
As I just see,

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:48.210
they're much more like each other now.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.170
We should create an eminence here,

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.280
which has circular form.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.450
It's a kind of style.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.630
I step on these part.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.210
I mean,

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.240
calf tab.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.180
We have two options here.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.450
Angle and its strenght.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.800
Okay,

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.970
You can't see them right over here on DA.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.820
We increase these sworn I mean strength,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.070
but not much.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.360
If you increase it a lot,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.710
it will be like this.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.050
See,

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.270
somehow the color has been pulled out.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.060
Just increase it to create a bump or,

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:29.200
um,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.000
in an eminence,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.550
not much.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.740
Okay,

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:40.720
Don't increase it a lot and angle helps us to drag it in and drag it out.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.520
Okay.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.060
See,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.500
we want to make it real.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.650
It's enough to drag out a little.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.080
I think I need to decrease the depth.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.070
Ah,

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.630
let me Okay,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.400
let me Yes,

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.070
Let me decrease it.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.270
So I select shape Juan from here.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:05.730
Oh,

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.160
here to decrease it.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:16.050
You can change the view off camera to make it like has the main model okay?

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.240
Ah,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.430
yes.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:21.050
Do that.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.570
Yeah.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.630
Okay.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.460
Yes,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.350
very good.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.490
Okay,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:36.070
let's work on the brightness is bums and the older parts C.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:42.660
We have to create some brightness is for all the sides off these three d object.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.680
Okay.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.520
Ah,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.550
actually,

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:53.090
you can set up some brightness is and color some parts,

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.320
like has read,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.860
eat for the PS.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.950
Okay,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.190
for example.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.840
Uh,

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.260
I can select these pores,

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.100
of course,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.640
Except the Bengals.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.510
Or let me select the mole because we're going to work on the brightness is okay.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:23.740
We do it and set up the brightness is on your object by these handles the first,

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:31.450
select them all and use these handles to set up their brightness is on your object,

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.980
then see?

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.760
Look at them.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.940
Yeah,

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.230
yeah.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:45.950
We have some handles here that can help us is set up.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:51.740
Our brightness is I set up the shine handle as zero and seat.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.210
Uh,

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.320
it gives us a blue color,

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.370
and if I increase it completely.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.090
The object will be so right.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.660
Well,

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.260
see,

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.450
whatever you increase these handles,

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.250
the speed off render will be decreased.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:18.450
You can light on the different ports with reflection handled and whatever you increase it,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.300
it will give you a special A style.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.110
Somehow it will be like a mirror.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.080
Okay.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.350
Uh,

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.730
actually,

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:37.350
it will show itself a lot in rendering process.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:41.360
The next one is bomb handle,

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.860
which is so useful but not here a lot,

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.360
because this level is completely published.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.800
Uh,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.130
let me select a rough material on these ports for now.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.110
See,

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.320
it has some bombs and holds,

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.660
uh,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.610
shine and reflection.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:07.450
Handles are not important because the structure is Roth.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.680
Uh,

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.320
see,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.390
whatever you increase the bombed handle,

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.110
the object will have more bombs and holds.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.590
But see Ah,

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.790
he feud.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.980
Decreases,

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.500
eat,

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.470
See?

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.760
Pay attention.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.900
If you decrease it,

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.880
they will be disappeared.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.930
The bombs and holds when we disappeared.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.960
And you have a normal a structure without any bomb for whole and see,

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.490
Actually,

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.670
these bombs and holds make our work more real.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.790
I turning back to the original.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.050
What I converted.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.090
OK,

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.760
eso I increased my shine and reflection handles.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:55.730
You can set it up as zero not to have any bombs or whole civilized.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:32:00.210
You can show inside of your object with capacity Handle.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:06.920
These features will show themselves mawr after horrendous er process.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.250
I mean,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.010
after the rendering process.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.470
Sorry.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.130
The object will be like,

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.150
uh,

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.530
like as a glass.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:19.760
When you decrease the opacity handle and you can see the inside of your object,

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.650
you can decrease it.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.280
Otherwise set it up as 100.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.890
Let me test.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.850
It's let me select this part too.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:40.060
Render it and I should click on these key.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:48.150
Or I can use shift old control or command and or i e press them at the same time to

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:48.810
rendering.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:49.560
Yes,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.960
it's working Well,

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.850
yes.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:00.660
See,

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.330
uh,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.010
actually,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:06.450
you can see the reflect on these side.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:10.110
See,

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:16.850
we have to wait about three or four minutes to render this little port.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:22.890
So cancel a rendering process by pressing E s c key.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:23.170
I mean,

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:24.000
it's skated.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.350
Uh,

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.880
should be selected by control.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.140
D ah.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.810
Let me consider the features off the main model.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.050
Let me see them.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:44.070
Well,

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:48.780
okay.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.800
I set up the layer on these section.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.330
Well,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.350
okay.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:34:04.110
We should move it,

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.470
actually,

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.090
in order to meet the render mode.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:14.160
Okay,

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.960
read it.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.230
I should create a perspective ist style.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.960
OK,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:27.350
now it's much more like the main model.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.250
See,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:38.820
this is a result of rendering process that you should do it at the end.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.060
I mean,

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:39.530
you should,

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.770
uh,

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.660
render it at the end,

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.840
but they may have some differences such as their colder,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.120
and it's not important.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.160
It's just enough to know how you can change the color.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.620
See,

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.200
Like these.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.680
Hey,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.280
I turn it back to the original.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:03.470
What?

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.690
I mean,

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:04.650
I encumbered it.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:05.650
I should,

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:09.570
uh okay,

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:16.890
I should decrease the reflection a lot.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.210
And I said
