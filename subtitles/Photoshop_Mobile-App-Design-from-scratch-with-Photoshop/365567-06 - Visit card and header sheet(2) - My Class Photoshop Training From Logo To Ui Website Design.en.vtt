X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Well,

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.490
we're back to finish up software.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.490
We're going to learn that how we can bring that crease older,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.850
these software and how we can design the hitter sheet and recent court.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.280
I want to work on the header shit of the first,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.250
uh,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:28.470
press control and or command end in Mac operating system to open a new document.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.280
We know,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.550
uh,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.730
and select A for project from prince section.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.370
It's been set by software before,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.460
but we can change it to centimeter.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.400
There is no difference.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.360
There is allusion must be 300.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.490
And it must be sit,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.460
uh,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.880
as pixel on inch.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.000
And you can change the color mint into C m y que.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.050
And actually I want to set up wide color for my background.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.950
I want a white my background I click on create icann to create an A for project over here.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.450
How do you see the objects are different from each other?

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.840
No matter you can create what you like.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.620
So I just used,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.530
uh,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.460
these objects.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.220
Just use this object for these project.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.500
Uh,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.210
let me.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.150
Which one is better?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.060
This one is better.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:34.280
I used this object for these projects and then we'll use it in our education.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.150
But let me sit some of these shapes.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.200
Well,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:57.230
well,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.390
uh,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.420
I selected completely.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.230
I select.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.860
I mean,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.080
all of these shaped by dragging most in order to take a copy off these,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.040
uh,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.250
and takeover of it by control or command.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.760
See?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.180
Then I'll back to my new project ing for the shops after and I'll use control or command V

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.310
toe open these panel and choose and needed option from here.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.150
Actually,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:32.480
we have Teoh pace are object as a smart object or pixel because we designed and colored it

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.690
in He in there,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.230
I mean in for Tisha Innis illustrator software.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.830
I suggest you to pace it as a smart object to eat it a easily later.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.230
But if you pace it as pixel,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.170
it will be like a photo see?

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.250
And,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.890
uh,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.310
we'll have no smart object.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.430
I can hear Onda.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.910
Uh,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.570
it's just a photo,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.050
See?

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.950
But I can unify it up too the last level.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.580
And,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.060
uh but I want to magnify it again.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.120
The quality will be decreased a lot because we pesetas pixel c ah,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.760
we lose our color if you pace it as shape in finish off software.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.590
What if we pace it as path?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.600
It could be like this.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.750
See,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.050
we re lose our caller if you pace it as shape in finish up.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.490
What if we pesetas path?

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.560
It will be like this.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.350
See?

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.590
Then we'll have a lot to do with it.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.980
So the best option is smart Object.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.670
Why?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.490
As I said,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.220
do it because you can edit it hazily later.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.480
As you see,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.780
we didn't have these icon in pixel.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.280
See?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.530
Let me show you.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.820
Can You didn't have these in,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.520
uh,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.850
Peekskill.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.460
It is the sign off.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.610
Smart object in a project.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.350
And if you double click on this icon,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.610
the last of your software will be open for us.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.540
I mean,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.800
I will be open for you.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.070
And as you see,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.920
I have two tabs.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.580
One of them is these which has color palette.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.950
The 2nd 1 is these which is open for us in illustrator software.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.580
And see,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.250
for example,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.570
we can actually we have these little triangle in both parts.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.290
I set it up here.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.360
Just is enough to use control or command as to save it.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.490
And then I'll go to four shots after see it's been moved here,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.970
too.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.310
Yes,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.230
just like these.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.670
Okay,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:14.450
I covered it and saying it in the same Where you see it's been down here too.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.480
And it will be converted in the sport to cholera it and save it.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.220
And it will be colored in the spark to and both of the projects contains seem like a,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.670
uh,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.260
color mud covered it and see well,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.890
so you can edit it.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.210
I mean,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.380
you can edit your shape in illustrator,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.180
and that's good.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.490
That's a good point off smart object icon.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.660
I close the project because I don't need it.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.870
And now,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.760
as you see,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.130
I said that crease cell moved down here and I took a Kewpie of it and paste it here.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.890
I mean,

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.250
pasted on that op report.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.330
They're not different from each order.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.940
See,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.270
exactly like the upper one are just rotated by control.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.880
T I just irritated before by control t I talked about it there.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.660
I just wanted to show you Is that,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.260
uh,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.090
somehow difficult at all?

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.950
We should rotate it by control or command tea,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.450
and,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.550
uh,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.120
we can set it everywhere we like.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.700
Actually,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.680
these header sheet won't be the same as the main model.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.240
Because because of the object.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.790
Yes.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.490
I mean these crystal.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.980
Anyway,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.290
no matter I set it up here,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.250
I take a copy of it and drag it here.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.950
Then I use control T.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.180
And I click right in,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.700
uh,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.250
transform.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.610
We have two options,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.080
Philip.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.990
Horizontal and flip vertical.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.560
We can convert it.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.060
I mean,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:07.220
rotated completely by paying attention to why axis by flee prison.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:14.110
Tal and flip vertical do the same work by paying attention to the X axis around exactness.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.280
I mean,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.450
it's mirrors,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.540
uh,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.000
mirrors it around.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.110
Eggs axis.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.950
We can use each option we like.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:29.960
Let's see which for me is more beautiful when you can irritate it.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.750
Well,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.010
we created these objects in our hitter shit up to now.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.410
If you pay attention,

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.300
you'll see that both off the objects have their own shadows.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.220
How can we create them,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:49.590
keep pressing on old key and take a copy of it and then transferring to a lower layer,

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.060
I drag the mouse to do it,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:00.650
Or I can move it up and down by using control or command.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.980
Uh,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.150
I ve right.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.140
Or actually left bracket.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.500
Yes.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.340
I can use control or command V Writer left bracket would be magnified,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.630
Uh,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.530
by control T OK,

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.360
and I use capacity to light it.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.050
See,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.560
we should decrease the opacity.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.570
I think 10% is okay.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.600
Well,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.080
10% I think.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.040
Yes.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.510
Person is okay.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.110
Yes.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.810
Well,

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.940
uh,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.250
let move it.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.270
Yeah,

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.740
and we can do the same work with a lower one.
