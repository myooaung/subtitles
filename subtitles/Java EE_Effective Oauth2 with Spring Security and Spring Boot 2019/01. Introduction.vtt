The demo application, Crypto Portfolio,

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.153
allows users to monitor their cryptocurrency positions.

3
00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:10.199
In its current state,

4
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.936
it uses a traditional three-tier architecture built

5
00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:18.250
using Spring MVC and Spring Boot, your typical monolith.

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.259
It is secured with Spring Security and has its own user registration.

7
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.187
If you have watched my previous course,

8
00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:27.822
you're probably familiar with this application.

9
00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:32.205
Data shows that a significant percentage of potential new users are

10
00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.758
not completing their user registration process,

11
00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:41.046
and there is an increased volume of failed login attempts and password resets.

12
00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:45.115
To address this, we can try to complement the site with social sign-in,

13
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:50.016
giving users with either a Google or Facebook account the option of

14
00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:54.255
registering and logging into Crypto Portfolio without having to fill in

15
00:00:54.255 --> 00:01:00.000
the registration page or provide their password. Let's start with Facebook.
