1
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:06,199
You now have the practical knowledge of how to apply OAuth2 and

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:11,928
OpenID Connect to a basic monolithic MVC web application or a

3
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,075
public single-page application,

4
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:18,103
which communicates with a number of RESTful services.

5
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:22,681
However, there are still some missing pieces to this puzzle.

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,788
In the real world,

7
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:27,959
you're more likely going to come across more complex security

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:32,746
requirements where your MVC or SPA client communicates with

9
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:37,036
multiple services where requests require multiple hops between

10
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,004
these services to resolve.

11
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:43,232
Or what if your resource server is not a human?

12
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:48,798
How can you use OAuth2 for secure, machine-to-machine interactions?

13
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,005
In the next module,

14
00:00:50,005 --> 00:01:01,000
we'll look at various security patterns you can add to your knowledge toolbox to deal with such scenarios when they come your way.
