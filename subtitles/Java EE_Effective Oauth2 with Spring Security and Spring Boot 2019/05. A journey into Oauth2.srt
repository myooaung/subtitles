00:00:01,657 --> 00:00:05,119
OAuth2 is an open standard used to protect a resource

2
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:07,066
known as the protected resource.

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:10,025
To understand OAuth, you need to understand the actors.

4
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:14,092
Let's use a railway analogy to help explain this.

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:16,879
A passenger wants to ride a train from Lewisham

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,314
station to London Bridge station.

7
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,984
In OAuth, the passenger would be known as the client,

8
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:26,162
the entity that wants to access the protected resource.

9
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:29,573
The train trip is the protected resource.

10
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:32,159
Now the train trip is protected by the train station.

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,342
In order for the passenger to get on the train,

12
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:37,588
they need to get through the gates.

13
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:41,022
In OAuth, the train station would be known as the resource server,

14
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:46,840
an entity capable of authorizing access to a protected resource.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,497
In order to get through the gates, the passenger needs a valid ticket.

16
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:54,105
In OAuth, that would be known as the token.

17
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:57,543
It can be a by value where the details are visible

18
00:00:57,543 --> 00:01:00,129
on the ticket or by reference,

19
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,471
like an eticket where the details of the trip are stored on the

20
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:06,892
server and need to be looked up to validate.

21
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:11,292
In order to get a valid ticket, the passenger needs to use a ticket machine.

22
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:14,373
The ticket machine in OAuth is known as the authorization server,

23
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,820
the entity that can issue the tokens.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,689
However, before it can issue the ticket,

25
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,292
it needs to check with the train company on the price and

26
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,975
if they authorize access to the trip.

27
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:30,645
The train company is the resource owner,

28
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:35,312
an entity capable of authorizing access to a protected resource.

29
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:38,939
Now understanding these actors is key.

30
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,129
And OAuth2 has a number of flows that orchestrate the interactions

31
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:46,384
of these actors that cater to various scenarios.

32
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:54,000
The most popular and secure is the authorization code grant. Let's go through it with an example.
