00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.240
Our portfolio service needs to make a REST call to the new pricing

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.744
service to retrieve the latest prices for cryptocurrencies in

3
00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:16.342
order to calculate the portfolio value.

4
00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:19.784
Since we won't be forwarding the access token to the

5
00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:21.800
pricing service for authorization,

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.376
the portfolio service will need to source a new token from

7
00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:31.329
Keycloak using the client credentials grant.

8
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.710
In the Keycloak admin console, we need a new client.

9
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.022
Let's call it portfolio-service.

10
00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:44.957
Confidential as we need a client secret, and Service Accounts enabled ON.

11
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:46.047
Everything OFF.

12
00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:50.145
Service Accounts ON enables the client credentials flow.

13
00:00:50.145 --> 00:01:00.000
Okay, that's it. Next, let's configure our portfolio service as a client to use this token.
