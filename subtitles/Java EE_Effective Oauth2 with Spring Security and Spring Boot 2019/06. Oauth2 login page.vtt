00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:07.254
Since we added OAuth2 to our project, if the user is not authenticated,

2
00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:10.443
they are redirected to the Spring's custom OAuth2 login page,

3
00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:15.474
which is just a list of links to the providers we configured.

4
00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:15.789
However,

5
00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.369
we want it to default back to our custom login page and add the

6
00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.581
links to sign in with Google and Facebook to that.

7
00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:28.785
In our WebSecurityConfigurationAdapter on the OAuth2Login builder,

8
00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.011
we add our loginPage URI.

9
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.987
We now need to add two links to our login page,

10
00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:39.342
starting with oauth2/authorization.

11
00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:40.372
If you recall,

12
00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:45.915
that's the URI the OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter will intercept.

13
00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:49.091
We add the registration ID for the provider,

14
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.919
in this case Facebook and Google, and that's it.

15
00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.392
The user now has these options available.

16
00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:56.926
And if we select them,

17
00:00:56.926 --> 00:01:00.874
the Auth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter will intercept

18
00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:04.889
the request and initiate the OAuth2 flow by sending the

19
00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:08.910
initial redirect to the provider, requesting the access code.

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.321
Now if this is a new user, we need to register them by storing their name,

21
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:14.779
email,

22
00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:18.505
and setting up a portfolio so that we can maintain the state of

23
00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:21.182
their crypto holdings each time they log in.

24
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:25.955
We want to do this automatically without the user having to do anything.

25
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:29.982
For them, ideally, it should be just sign in with Google or Facebook,

26
00:01:29.982 --> 00:01:34.000
and they're ready to go. Let's set this up next.
