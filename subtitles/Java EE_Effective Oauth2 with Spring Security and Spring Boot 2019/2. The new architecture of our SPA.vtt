00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.724
The main difference is that the back end will now be a RestController

2
00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:10.137
rather than an MvcController as the communication between the JavaScript

3
00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:14.395
and the server will be done via JSON REST calls.

4
00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:18.336
It will be stateless and no cookies in the browser.

5
00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:20.091
We will have two microservices,

6
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:23.683
one the portfolio and the other the support service.

7
00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:26.167
The React app will the client.

8
00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.184
And we'll set up an OpenID Connect flow using the

9
00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:31.428
implicit grant type between the clients,

10
00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:34.490
the user, and the authorization server.

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:43.000
Once it gets an access token back from the auth server, it will include it in all requests to the microservices.
