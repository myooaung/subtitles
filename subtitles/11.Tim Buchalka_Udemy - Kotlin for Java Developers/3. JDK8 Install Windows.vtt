00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:07.019
In this video, I'm going to go ahead and
2

2

00:00:07.019  -->  00:00:10.139
download and install the JDK which is
3

3

00:00:10.139  -->  00:00:11.879
the Java development kit which contains
4

4

00:00:11.879  -->  00:00:13.650
the software to be able to run programs
5

5

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:16.080
in this course. Now if you're running on
6

6

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:18.750
a Mac or a Linux machine, you want to
7

7

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:20.820
check out a specific video that we've
8

8

00:00:20.820  -->  00:00:22.710
created in this section of the course
9

9

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:25.289
for those operating systems, the reason
10

10

00:00:25.289  -->  00:00:26.730
is the steps are slightly different for
11

11

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:28.530
each platform. So this is the windows
12

12

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:31.020
video. So, if you are on Windows going to
13

13

00:00:31.020  -->  00:00:35.539
start by going to java.oracle.com
14

14

00:00:35.539  -->  00:00:38.670
it'll bring you to a page from Oracle
15

15

00:00:38.670  -->  00:00:40.770
which are now the owners of the Java
16

16

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:42.570
product. When I come over here and the
17

17

00:00:42.570  -->  00:00:47.309
technologies and click on Java SE and
18

18

00:00:47.309  -->  00:00:48.960
once that page loads, come over here and
19

19

00:00:48.960  -->  00:00:52.649
click on downloads and finally once we
20

20

00:00:52.649  -->  00:00:54.420
get to that page, there's this little
21

21

00:00:54.420  -->  00:00:56.820
icon here this little image and it
22

22

00:00:56.820  -->  00:00:59.670
will say Java platform JDK and a number
23

23

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:01.920
here. Now it's highly likely that this
24

24

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:04.110
number will change in the future because
25

25

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:06.000
Oracle release at regular intervals
26

26

00:01:06.000  -->  00:01:08.940
updates to the Java development kit,
27

27

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:10.080
so if you're going to later number then
28

28

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:12.390
that's fine, just click on the
29

29

00:01:12.390  -->  00:01:14.820
graphic there and that will take
30

30

00:01:14.820  -->  00:01:16.770
you to the download page, when we can
31

31

00:01:16.770  -->  00:01:19.110
actually download the software. Now what
32

32

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:21.479
we need to do is determine whether your
33

33

00:01:21.479  -->  00:01:24.750
computer is of 32 or is running a 32 or
34

34

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:27.750
64-bit version of Windows, the reason for
35

35

00:01:27.750  -->  00:01:29.670
that is that there's two versions of the
36

36

00:01:29.670  -->  00:01:31.920
JDK available, you can see here windows
37

37

00:01:31.920  -->  00:01:36.360
x86 and windows x64 so what that means is
38

38

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:38.880
windows x86 is for computers running
39

39

00:01:38.880  -->  00:01:42.800
32-bit version of Windows and Windows x64
40

40

00:01:42.800  -->  00:01:45.450
is for 64-bit version of Windows, so to
41

41

00:01:45.450  -->  00:01:46.770
find out which version you're running on
42

42

00:01:46.770  -->  00:01:48.600
your computer, you basically want to get
43

43

00:01:48.600  -->  00:01:50.970
into control panel or if I'm Windows 10
44

44

00:01:50.970  -->  00:01:52.530
it's settings, so I'm going to come down
45

45

00:01:52.530  -->  00:01:54.840
here, click on the start icon, click on
46

46

00:01:54.840  -->  00:01:57.390
settings, once you get into your control
47

47

00:01:57.390  -->  00:01:59.009
panel or in my case windows settings
48

48

00:01:59.009  -->  00:02:01.140
click on system and then there's an
49

49

00:02:01.140  -->  00:02:03.329
option down here for about that's
50

50

00:02:03.329  -->  00:02:05.579
certainly what it is for Windows 10,
51

51

00:02:05.579  -->  00:02:06.930
it might be slightly different for older
52

52

00:02:06.930  -->  00:02:08.549
versions of Windows, but there's an
53

53

00:02:08.549  -->  00:02:10.349
option on all versions of Windows to
54

54

00:02:10.349  -->  00:02:11.730
tell you what version of Windows you're
55

55

00:02:11.730  -->  00:02:14.400
running and here on the system type,
56

56

00:02:14.400  -->  00:02:16.019
you can see that it's a 64-bit operating
57

57

00:02:16.019  -->  00:02:17.780
system so ignore
58

58

00:02:17.780  -->  00:02:20.390
this part to the right where it says x64
59

59

00:02:20.390  -->  00:02:22.910
based processor, because it is possible
60

60

00:02:22.910  -->  00:02:25.390
confusingly to have a 64-bit processor
61

61

00:02:25.390  -->  00:02:28.310
but to be running a 32-bit version of
62

62

00:02:28.310  -->  00:02:31.370
the Windows operating system. So the bit
63

63

00:02:31.370  -->  00:02:32.810
the important bit here is to the left
64

64

00:02:32.810  -->  00:02:35.450
when it's a 64-bit operating system that
65

65

00:02:35.450  -->  00:02:37.580
tells me there that I'm running a 64-bit
66

66

00:02:37.580  -->  00:02:39.709
version of the operating system and I
67

67

00:02:39.709  -->  00:02:41.870
can now choose my download the only
68

68

00:02:41.870  -->  00:02:43.459
other option that would come up would be
69

69

00:02:43.459  -->  00:02:46.310
a 32-bit version and once you know that,
70

70

00:02:46.310  -->  00:02:48.560
you can close that screen down you come
71

71

00:02:48.560  -->  00:02:50.390
back to the page that we loaded
72

72

00:02:50.390  -->  00:02:52.070
previously and choose the relevant
73

73

00:02:52.070  -->  00:02:55.130
version. Now before that allow you to download,
74

74

00:02:55.130  -->  00:02:56.959
you need to click on accept license
75

75

00:02:56.959  -->  00:02:59.330
agreement this little radio button that
76

76

00:02:59.330  -->  00:03:01.070
you saw me click and now I need to
77

77

00:03:01.070  -->  00:03:03.230
choose the version, so a 32-bit version
78

78

00:03:03.230  -->  00:03:06.080
that would be the windows x86 version in
79

79

00:03:06.080  -->  00:03:08.930
my case 64-bit, 64-bit version or
80

80

00:03:08.930  -->  00:03:11.180
64-bit edition of Windows, so I'm going
81

81

00:03:11.180  -->  00:03:12.290
to click on that little option there to
82

82

00:03:12.290  -->  00:03:14.180
me, so you'll choose which other one is
83

83

00:03:14.180  -->  00:03:16.459
appropriate and I'm going to click on
84

84

00:03:16.459  -->  00:03:19.640
run to let Windows run this,
85

85

00:03:19.640  -->  00:03:21.019
so that we can go ahead and install it.
86

86

00:03:21.019  -->  00:03:23.030
So I'll just fast-forward this while it
87

87

00:03:23.030  -->  00:03:29.590
continues and completes the download.
88

88

00:03:29.590  -->  00:03:31.780
Okay so I've gone ahead and the download
89

89

00:03:31.780  -->  00:03:33.160
is finished and it started because I
90

90

00:03:33.160  -->  00:03:35.110
selected it to run now if you didn't
91

91

00:03:35.110  -->  00:03:37.060
select run, you might have to double
92

92

00:03:37.060  -->  00:03:40.000
click the downloaded program to start it
93

93

00:03:40.000  -->  00:03:41.890
but in any event it should start,
94

94

00:03:41.890  -->  00:03:43.150
I'm going to close in the browser because we
95

95

00:03:43.150  -->  00:03:44.950
no longer need it and you get to a
96

96

00:03:44.950  -->  00:03:46.690
process like this an installation
97

97

00:03:46.690  -->  00:03:48.099
process that we can actually go through.
98

98

00:03:48.099  -->  00:03:49.840
So I can come through here now, I can
99

99

00:03:49.840  -->  00:03:52.599
click on next now you may actually need
100

100

00:03:52.599  -->  00:03:55.060
to know this later in the course, so just
101

101

00:03:55.060  -->  00:03:56.620
keep to the back your mind or perhaps
102

102

00:03:56.620  -->  00:03:59.920
write down the area or the path that
103

103

00:03:59.920  -->  00:04:01.660
this software has been installed in,
104

104

00:04:01.660  -->  00:04:03.060
you can see in my case it's going to be
105

105

00:04:03.060  -->  00:04:05.860
installed in c colon backslash Program
106

106

00:04:05.860  -->  00:04:08.140
Files backslash Java and then this
107

107

00:04:08.140  -->  00:04:09.640
number will relate to the version that
108

108

00:04:09.640  -->  00:04:12.310
you've downloaded, the important part is
109

109

00:04:12.310  -->  00:04:14.860
Program Files slash Java so you may need
110

110

00:04:14.860  -->  00:04:16.419
may or may not need that later in the
111

111

00:04:16.419  -->  00:04:19.000
course but have a make a mental note
112

112

00:04:19.000  -->  00:04:20.459
of that or write it down so you know.
113

113

00:04:20.459  -->  00:04:22.540
Click on next, we don't need to change
114

114

00:04:22.540  -->  00:04:24.430
any options there, we'll let it do its
115

115

00:04:24.430  -->  00:04:30.920
thing and install, next thing it does is install JDK
116

116

00:04:30.920  -->  00:04:34.160
but it also wants to install the JRE,
117

117

00:04:34.160  -->  00:04:37.390
JRE stands for Java Runtime Edition and
118

118

00:04:37.390  -->  00:04:39.620
you do need to have both things on your
119

119

00:04:39.620  -->  00:04:41.180
computer in order to be able to use
120

120

00:04:41.180  -->  00:04:43.610
Java, so we're going to just click on
121

121

00:04:43.610  -->  00:04:46.490
next, noting that that directory the C
122

122

00:04:46.490  -->  00:04:49.010
colon backslash program files slash Java
123

123

00:04:49.010  -->  00:04:50.660
so it's actually putting it in a
124

124

00:04:50.660  -->  00:04:52.010
different sub folder and again you may
125

125

00:04:52.010  -->  00:04:53.990
need that later in the course, click on
126

126

00:04:53.990  -->  00:04:58.370
next and let it do its thing again.
127

127

00:04:58.370  -->  00:05:00.599
Alright, so at this point so you can
128

128

00:05:00.599  -->  00:05:02.099
see that it's come up and said the java
129

129

00:05:02.099  -->  00:05:05.039
SE development kit 8 update and then the
130

130

00:05:05.039  -->  00:05:06.810
number has been successfully installed,
131

131

00:05:06.810  -->  00:05:08.550
so we're actually done so and click on
132

132

00:05:08.550  -->  00:05:10.979
close. I'm going to finish the video here
133

133

00:05:10.979  -->  00:05:14.389
let's move on to the next one.
