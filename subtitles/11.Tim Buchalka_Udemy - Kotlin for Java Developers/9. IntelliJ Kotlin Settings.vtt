00:00:04.710  -->  00:00:07.319
In this video, I'm going to show you a
2

2

00:00:07.319  -->  00:00:09.420
few of IntelliJ's configuration
3

3

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:11.760
settings that apply to Kotlin.
4

4

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:14.190
Now IntelliJ is the IDE, we'll use in this
5

5

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:16.410
course as you probably know by now, so if
6

6

00:00:16.410  -->  00:00:18.570
you haven't installed it, you should
7

7

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:21.180
watch the installation videos before you
8

8

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:22.680
watch this one. There are videos
9

9

00:00:22.680  -->  00:00:25.770
available for Windows Mac and Linux and
10

10

00:00:25.770  -->  00:00:28.830
in those videos, Tim Buchalka
11

11

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:31.410
goes over settings that apply to all
12

12

00:00:31.410  -->  00:00:34.050
languages, in this video we'll focus on
13

13

00:00:34.050  -->  00:00:36.660
Kotlin, also if you don't have the JDK
14

14

00:00:36.660  -->  00:00:38.550
installed, you should install it now a
15

15

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:41.160
Java 8 jdk is fine
16

16

00:00:41.160  -->  00:00:44.430
Java 9 is okay too, if it's available it
17

17

00:00:44.430  -->  00:00:46.079
wasn't available when I was recording
18

18

00:00:46.079  -->  00:00:47.850
this but it might be available when
19

19

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:49.770
you're watching this video, if you've
20

20

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:52.079
forgotten how to install the JDK or you
21

21

00:00:52.079  -->  00:00:54.510
just want to follow somebody else doing
22

22

00:00:54.510  -->  00:00:56.640
it, you can watch the JDK installation
23

23

00:00:56.640  -->  00:01:00.000
video. Now I have IntelliJ open with a
24

24

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:02.879
test project, just a dummy project that
25

25

00:01:02.879  -->  00:01:06.390
has one Kotlin file in it. Now the first
26

26

00:01:06.390  -->  00:01:07.890
and most important thing that you have
27

27

00:01:07.890  -->  00:01:10.530
to do is double check that the Kotlin
28

28

00:01:10.530  -->  00:01:14.310
plug-in is installed and enabled Kotlin
29

29

00:01:14.310  -->  00:01:17.670
is a plug-in to IntelliJ, so you need to
30

30

00:01:17.670  -->  00:01:20.430
have it and it needs to be enabled.
31

31

00:01:20.430  -->  00:01:22.650
Now, you should have it by default and it
32

32

00:01:22.650  -->  00:01:24.720
should be enabled by default but we'll
33

33

00:01:24.720  -->  00:01:26.189
double check just to make sure that
34

34

00:01:26.189  -->  00:01:27.390
you're not going to run into a problem.
35

35

00:01:27.390  -->  00:01:31.290
Now I'm on the Windows platform so my
36

36

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:35.960
settings dialog is located at file
37

37

00:01:35.960  -->  00:01:39.390
settings, if you're on another operating
38

38

00:01:39.390  -->  00:01:41.430
system, yours might be in a different
39

39

00:01:41.430  -->  00:01:42.900
location and if you don't know where it
40

40

00:01:42.900  -->  00:01:45.060
is, you can either just search for it,
41

41

00:01:45.060  -->  00:01:47.790
it might be under edit or you can go and
42

42

00:01:47.790  -->  00:01:50.729
watch the setup video for your operating
43

43

00:01:50.729  -->  00:01:52.740
system and you can watch them go through
44

44

00:01:52.740  -->  00:01:55.590
the general settings there. Okay so file
45

45

00:01:55.590  -->  00:01:59.670
settings and once you get to the
46

46

00:01:59.670  -->  00:02:01.200
settings dialog, it should look the same
47

47

00:02:01.200  -->  00:02:03.990
and we're going to go to I'm going to
48

48

00:02:03.990  -->  00:02:06.329
close up this editor and so close
49

49

00:02:06.329  -->  00:02:08.310
everything up if you have anything open
50

50

00:02:08.310  -->  00:02:10.049
and then we want to go to plugins and
51

51

00:02:10.049  -->  00:02:13.829
this shows a list of plugins and whether
52

52

00:02:13.829  -->  00:02:15.540
they're installed and what you should do
53

53

00:02:15.540  -->  00:02:18.540
at this point is enter Kotlin
54

54

00:02:18.540  -->  00:02:21.750
in the search box here and Kotlin should
55

55

00:02:21.750  -->  00:02:23.790
come up and when I'm recording this the
56

56

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:25.680
latest version is one point one point
57

57

00:02:25.680  -->  00:02:28.769
three. Now you should see Kotlin and make
58

58

00:02:28.769  -->  00:02:30.629
sure this is the important part make
59

59

00:02:30.629  -->  00:02:33.239
sure this box is checked because if it
60

60

00:02:33.239  -->  00:02:35.069
is unchecked, it means that the plug-in
61

61

00:02:35.069  -->  00:02:37.799
is disabled and you want to make sure
62

62

00:02:37.799  -->  00:02:41.519
it's enabled, so make sure this box is
63

63

00:02:41.519  -->  00:02:45.049
checked and when it is just click ok and
64

64

00:02:45.049  -->  00:02:49.049
now your Kotlin plug-in is enabled.
65

65

00:02:49.049  -->  00:02:50.909
Okay, now that we know Kotlin is enabled let's
66

66

00:02:50.909  -->  00:02:52.620
look at a couple of other settings now
67

67

00:02:52.620  -->  00:02:56.220
in IntelliJ version 2017 point two which
68

68

00:02:56.220  -->  00:02:57.919
is the one I'm running right now,
69

69

00:02:57.919  -->  00:03:00.450
parameter hints were added for Kotlin.
70

70

00:03:00.450  -->  00:03:03.329
Now if you've been using IntelliJ with
71

71

00:03:03.329  -->  00:03:06.329
Java, you'll know what these are or you
72

72

00:03:06.329  -->  00:03:07.950
might have seen them a couple of times
73

73

00:03:07.950  -->  00:03:10.739
and then turn them off JetBrains added
74

74

00:03:10.739  -->  00:03:13.409
this feature for java sometime in 2016
75

75

00:03:13.409  -->  00:03:15.689
and what it does, is it adds the
76

76

00:03:15.689  -->  00:03:17.669
parameter names as hints, when you call a
77

77

00:03:17.669  -->  00:03:19.650
method, so I'm going to show you where
78

78

00:03:19.650  -->  00:03:21.930
the setting is we're going to go up to
79

79

00:03:21.930  -->  00:03:25.560
file, settings we're going to expand the
80

80

00:03:25.560  -->  00:03:27.780
editor node, we're going to expand
81

81

00:03:27.780  -->  00:03:29.489
general and we're going to click on
82

82

00:03:29.489  -->  00:03:33.090
appearance and there's an item here that
83

83

00:03:33.090  -->  00:03:36.540
says show parameter name hints, so I'm
84

84

00:03:36.540  -->  00:03:38.729
going to check this I normally have it
85

85

00:03:38.729  -->  00:03:40.500
off and I'm going to check this and
86

86

00:03:40.500  -->  00:03:42.510
click ok, because I want to show you what
87

87

00:03:42.510  -->  00:03:44.729
it does and now I'm going to write some
88

88

00:03:44.729  -->  00:03:46.949
Kotlin code. Now don't worry about this
89

89

00:03:46.949  -->  00:03:49.139
code, everything I do here is covered in
90

90

00:03:49.139  -->  00:03:50.639
the course I just want to show you what
91

91

00:03:50.639  -->  00:03:53.519
this setting does, so I'm going to say
92

92

00:03:53.519  -->  00:03:57.120
fun area and it's going to accept a
93

93

00:03:57.120  -->  00:04:03.689
width and a height and all it's going to
94

94

00:04:03.689  -->  00:04:09.079
do is print line print line width equal
95

95

00:04:09.079  -->  00:04:14.159
width and height equals height and don't
96

96

00:04:14.159  -->  00:04:15.930
worry about anything that's going on in
97

97

00:04:15.930  -->  00:04:18.060
here and now I'm going to make some
98

98

00:04:18.060  -->  00:04:19.620
space here because I want to add a main
99

99

00:04:19.620  -->  00:04:21.720
function and I'm just going to call this
100

100

00:04:21.720  -->  00:04:25.740
function with two integers now you can
101

101

00:04:25.740  -->  00:04:28.349
see what happened here these parameter
102

102

00:04:28.349  -->  00:04:30.810
hints were added, these are not code
103

103

00:04:30.810  -->  00:04:34.830
these are just hints in the IDE, the compiler doesn't
104

104

00:04:34.830  -->  00:04:37.620
see these at all, but this is what that
105

105

00:04:37.620  -->  00:04:40.770
setting does. Now frankly I find that
106

106

00:04:40.770  -->  00:04:42.990
they get in the way, so I've turned them
107

107

00:04:42.990  -->  00:04:45.270
off for Java and I had them turned off
108

108

00:04:45.270  -->  00:04:47.400
for Kotlin as well and in fact there's
109

109

00:04:47.400  -->  00:04:50.190
just one setting for all languages.
110

110

00:04:50.190  -->  00:04:51.870
Now Tim might have showed you this in the
111

111

00:04:51.870  -->  00:04:53.729
settings video, but the reason I'm
112

112

00:04:53.729  -->  00:04:55.680
bringing it up is that Kotlin has this
113

113

00:04:55.680  -->  00:04:57.840
functionality built into the language,
114

114

00:04:57.840  -->  00:05:01.350
you can label your parameters and one of
115

115

00:05:01.350  -->  00:05:03.150
the reasons I typed in this code is to
116

116

00:05:03.150  -->  00:05:05.490
show you that you can do that and so if
117

117

00:05:05.490  -->  00:05:08.010
you feel that there's a time in your
118

118

00:05:08.010  -->  00:05:10.020
code where you you want parameter hints,
119

119

00:05:10.020  -->  00:05:12.150
you can just label your parameters,
120

120

00:05:12.150  -->  00:05:14.160
you can use Kotlin to do it but this is what
121

121

00:05:14.160  -->  00:05:17.130
they look like, I'm now going to go into
122

122

00:05:17.130  -->  00:05:22.710
the settings dialog and turn it off so
123

123

00:05:22.710  -->  00:05:24.210
I'm going to turn these off and when
124

124

00:05:24.210  -->  00:05:27.240
I do, you'll see that we no longer get the
125

125

00:05:27.240  -->  00:05:28.620
hints. Now if you want to leave them in
126

126

00:05:28.620  -->  00:05:30.750
that's fine, but let me quickly show you
127

127

00:05:30.750  -->  00:05:33.419
what Kotlin can do and we'll cover this
128

128

00:05:33.419  -->  00:05:35.789
again in the course, so here we have two
129

129

00:05:35.789  -->  00:05:38.400
int parameters and don't worry about the
130

130

00:05:38.400  -->  00:05:40.349
syntax, it will be covered and I'm going
131

131

00:05:40.349  -->  00:05:43.680
to stop saying that now in the area call
132

132

00:05:43.680  -->  00:05:45.750
somebody coming along and looking at
133

133

00:05:45.750  -->  00:05:47.370
this code and let's pretend that they
134

134

00:05:47.370  -->  00:05:49.169
don't have this code on the screen,
135

135

00:05:49.169  -->  00:05:50.760
they're not going to know what ten and
136

136

00:05:50.760  -->  00:05:52.500
twenty means they just see two numbers,
137

137

00:05:52.500  -->  00:05:54.180
so in Kotlin you can actually label
138

138

00:05:54.180  -->  00:05:58.320
these, you can say this is width and you
139

139

00:05:58.320  -->  00:06:02.400
can say this is height and this is code
140

140

00:06:02.400  -->  00:06:04.979
this isn't just a hint, the compiler
141

141

00:06:04.979  -->  00:06:07.620
actually sees these, so labeling
142

142

00:06:07.620  -->  00:06:09.570
parameters as part of the language so
143

143

00:06:09.570  -->  00:06:12.030
I think that the setting for Kotlin is a
144

144

00:06:12.030  -->  00:06:14.280
bit redundant, I'm not sure that you
145

145

00:06:14.280  -->  00:06:16.620
actually need it because if you do have
146

146

00:06:16.620  -->  00:06:18.750
code in your application that you feel
147

147

00:06:18.750  -->  00:06:20.910
you have to label, you can do it using
148

148

00:06:20.910  -->  00:06:23.340
the Kotlin language and then if you give
149

149

00:06:23.340  -->  00:06:25.590
this file to another developer and they
150

150

00:06:25.590  -->  00:06:28.410
use a different IDE, these labels are
151

151

00:06:28.410  -->  00:06:30.479
still going to be there and that won't
152

152

00:06:30.479  -->  00:06:32.250
be true for the parameter hints because
153

153

00:06:32.250  -->  00:06:34.979
that's just an IDE feature. Now because
154

154

00:06:34.979  -->  00:06:36.780
you can label your parameters I'll just
155

155

00:06:36.780  -->  00:06:39.180
show you this quickly, you can actually
156

156

00:06:39.180  -->  00:06:42.300
pass parameters out of order as long as
157

157

00:06:42.300  -->  00:06:45.689
they're labeled. So I can move this
158

158

00:06:45.689  -->  00:06:50.909
parameter to the end so now I'm passing
159

159

00:06:50.909  -->  00:06:54.089
height first and width second and let's
160

160

00:06:54.089  -->  00:06:55.799
run this so I can just show you that
161

161

00:06:55.799  -->  00:06:59.759
this works and you'll see width equals
162

162

00:06:59.759  -->  00:07:02.399
ten and height equals 20, so even though
163

163

00:07:02.399  -->  00:07:04.199
I'm passing the parameters out of order
164

164

00:07:04.199  -->  00:07:06.209
because I've labeled them, the compiler
165

165

00:07:06.209  -->  00:07:08.849
is able to match them up correctly.
166

166

00:07:08.849  -->  00:07:10.529
So we'll see more of this in the course,
167

167

00:07:10.529  -->  00:07:12.839
I just wanted to show you that the
168

168

00:07:12.839  -->  00:07:14.909
labeling parameters is actually a
169

169

00:07:14.909  -->  00:07:17.999
language feature in Kotlin, so you don't
170

170

00:07:17.999  -->  00:07:20.009
really need the IDE feature but if you
171

171

00:07:20.009  -->  00:07:23.069
want to have the IDE provide those hints
172

172

00:07:23.069  -->  00:07:24.989
everywhere for you, that's fine. You now
173

173

00:07:24.989  -->  00:07:27.449
know how to turn that feature on and off.
174

174

00:07:27.449  -->  00:07:29.519
I'm going to keep the setting off.
175

175

00:07:29.519  -->  00:07:31.110
Alright so now I'm going to show you where
176

176

00:07:31.110  -->  00:07:33.029
you can change settings related to code
177

177

00:07:33.029  -->  00:07:35.099
style, so let's go back up to the
178

178

00:07:35.099  -->  00:07:37.439
settings dialog and I'm going to close
179

179

00:07:37.439  -->  00:07:40.379
up general and under editor, let's go to
180

180

00:07:40.379  -->  00:07:43.409
code style and if I expand this, you'll
181

181

00:07:43.409  -->  00:07:46.889
see there's an entry here for Kotlin,
182

182

00:07:46.889  -->  00:07:48.839
so if we click on that you can see this is
183

183

00:07:48.839  -->  00:07:50.729
where you can set things like how many
184

184

00:07:50.729  -->  00:07:54.059
spaces do you want around equals let's
185

185

00:07:54.059  -->  00:07:56.729
say here what do you want to do with
186

186

00:07:56.729  -->  00:07:59.550
imports, where do you want to put braces
187

187

00:07:59.550  -->  00:08:01.409
that sort of thing, so you can come in
188

188

00:08:01.409  -->  00:08:03.029
here and have a look at that if you want
189

189

00:08:03.029  -->  00:08:05.249
to change the defaults and the final
190

190

00:08:05.249  -->  00:08:07.849
setting we're going to look at is under
191

191

00:08:07.849  -->  00:08:10.769
smart keys, so I'm going to close this up
192

192

00:08:10.769  -->  00:08:14.459
we're under editor still, go under
193

193

00:08:14.459  -->  00:08:17.669
general and then smart keys and the only
194

194

00:08:17.669  -->  00:08:20.099
reason I'm showing you this is down here
195

195

00:08:20.099  -->  00:08:21.839
there's a section related to Kotlin,
196

196

00:08:21.839  -->  00:08:24.389
these two settings are related to Kotlin
197

197

00:08:24.389  -->  00:08:27.569
and IntelliJ's Java to Kotlin converter.
198

198

00:08:27.569  -->  00:08:29.849
Now you'll learn about this converter in
199

199

00:08:29.849  -->  00:08:31.469
the course and if you want to turn it
200

200

00:08:31.469  -->  00:08:34.709
off or on, this is where you do it.
201

201

00:08:34.709  -->  00:08:37.079
Okay, that's it for Kotlin settings IntelliJ
202

202

00:08:37.079  -->  00:08:38.969
has a ton of settings as you can see
203

203

00:08:38.969  -->  00:08:41.279
here and so you might want to spend some
204

204

00:08:41.279  -->  00:08:43.199
time exploring the settings dialog to
205

205

00:08:43.199  -->  00:08:44.850
see what you can do especially if you're
206

206

00:08:44.850  -->  00:08:47.189
new to IntelliJ, there's a lot of stuff
207

207

00:08:47.189  -->  00:08:49.379
you can do in here. Okay, I'm going to close
208

208

00:08:49.379  -->  00:08:52.139
this up now by hitting cancel. Now one
209

209

00:08:52.139  -->  00:08:54.959
last thing before I end this video when
210

210

00:08:54.959  -->  00:08:57.600
I started creating this course IntelliJ
211

211

00:08:57.600  -->  00:08:59.670
was at version 2017
212

212

00:08:59.670  -->  00:09:02.580
point one, when I was about 90% finished
213

213

00:09:02.580  -->  00:09:07.140
version 20 17.2 came out and I upgraded
214

214

00:09:07.140  -->  00:09:10.530
to that version, so I'm using IntelliJ
215

215

00:09:10.530  -->  00:09:13.800
2017 point two in this video and that's
216

216

00:09:13.800  -->  00:09:15.870
the most current version available at
217

217

00:09:15.870  -->  00:09:18.990
this time. Now not much has changed from
218

218

00:09:18.990  -->  00:09:22.080
2017 point one, but some of the dialogs
219

219

00:09:22.080  -->  00:09:24.270
have a flatter look to them and the font
220

220

00:09:24.270  -->  00:09:27.030
is different in some of the dialogs,
221

221

00:09:27.030  -->  00:09:29.820
so in a few of the videos in the course the
222

222

00:09:29.820  -->  00:09:32.940
IDE will look slightly different when it
223

223

00:09:32.940  -->  00:09:34.950
comes to dialogs and I just wanted to
224

224

00:09:34.950  -->  00:09:36.420
let you know about that in case you
225

225

00:09:36.420  -->  00:09:39.540
notice, you probably won't but if you do
226

226

00:09:39.540  -->  00:09:41.580
notice that you know in one video a
227

227

00:09:41.580  -->  00:09:43.710
dialog has a different font than
228

228

00:09:43.710  -->  00:09:45.630
another video, that's why it's because
229

229

00:09:45.630  -->  00:09:48.060
when I was about 90% of the way through
230

230

00:09:48.060  -->  00:09:50.670
creating the course, I upgraded to the
231

231

00:09:50.670  -->  00:09:53.370
latest version of IntelliJ. Okay let's
232

232

00:09:53.370  -->  00:09:55.050
move on to the next section where
233

233

00:09:55.050  -->  00:09:58.280
I'll introduce you to Kotlin.
