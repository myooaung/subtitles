Hello World programme in Kotlin,

00:00:10,160  -->  00:00:13,300
and then you're going to learn about some of the important

00:00:13,300  -->  00:00:16,650
syntax differences between Kotlin and Java.

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:19,500
We'll also take a look at the Kotlin standard library

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:21,920
and then we'll take a look at variable declarations

00:00:30,850  -->  00:00:33,390
also known as the REPL.
