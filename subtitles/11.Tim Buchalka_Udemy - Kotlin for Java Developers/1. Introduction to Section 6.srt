00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:06,720
In this section we're going to cover a
2

2

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:09,209
few odds and ends, we're going to cover
3

3

00:00:09,209  -->  00:00:11,779
loops we're going to cover the if
4

4

00:00:11,779  -->  00:00:14,699
statement or rather expression because
5

5

00:00:14,699  -->  00:00:16,410
that's the big change in Kotlin, you can
6

6

00:00:16,410  -->  00:00:18,689
use if as an expression we're going to
7

7

00:00:18,689  -->  00:00:21,780
cover try and catch and the fact that you
8

8

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:23,850
can now use it as an expression and
9

9

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:26,310
we're going to cover a new feature in
10

10

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:29,130
Kotlin called when which is essentially
11

11

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:31,770
the replacement for the switch statement
12

12

00:00:31,770  -->  00:00:36,500
in Java. So let's get started.
