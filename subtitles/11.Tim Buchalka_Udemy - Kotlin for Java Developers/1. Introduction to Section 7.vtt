00:00:04.710  -->  00:00:06.839
In this section, we're going to take a
2

2

00:00:06.839  -->  00:00:09.809
look at generics, collections and lambda
3

3

00:00:09.809  -->  00:00:12.480
expressions. Now these three features are
4

4

00:00:12.480  -->  00:00:15.299
often used together. Kotlin has done
5

5

00:00:15.299  -->  00:00:17.970
quite a bit with collections in terms of
6

6

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:20.430
adding convenience functions because
7

7

00:00:20.430  -->  00:00:22.230
Kotlin doesn't have its own collection
8

8

00:00:22.230  -->  00:00:24.660
classes, well that's not quite true it
9

9

00:00:24.660  -->  00:00:27.660
has a couple but the major ones like
10

10

00:00:27.660  -->  00:00:31.489
list and map and set and everything else
11

11

00:00:31.489  -->  00:00:35.430
that's all based on the Java classes as you'll see,
12

12

00:00:35.430  -->  00:00:38.820
but Kotlin has added functions that make
13

13

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:41.040
working with the collections classes a
14

14

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:43.200
lot more convenient, we'll also take a
15

15

00:00:43.200  -->  00:00:45.840
look at contra variance and covariance
16

16

00:00:45.840  -->  00:00:49.170
when we look at generics and we'll see
17

17

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:51.930
some enhancements to lambda expressions.
18

18

00:00:51.930  -->  00:00:53.850
So there's a lot for us to sink our
19

19

00:00:53.850  -->  00:00:58.010
teeth into. So let's get started.
