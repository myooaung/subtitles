00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:06,510
In this video, we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:08,100
and download and install the Java
3

3

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:10,469
development kit also known as the JDK.
4

4

00:00:10,469  -->  00:00:12,349
We're going to install it on Linux
5

5

00:00:12,349  -->  00:00:14,429
specifically we're going to install it
6

6

00:00:14,429  -->  00:00:18,029
on ubuntu 16.04, so if you're running a
7

7

00:00:18,029  -->  00:00:20,009
different version of Linux, you should be
8

8

00:00:20,009  -->  00:00:21,329
able to follow along and do something
9

9

00:00:21,329  -->  00:00:24,360
similar for your distro and also keep in
10

10

00:00:24,360  -->  00:00:25,290
mind if you're running on a Windows
11

11

00:00:25,290  -->  00:00:27,720
machine or a Mac computer
12

12

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:30,180
we've actually got separate videos for
13

13

00:00:30,180  -->  00:00:31,919
your operating systems because the
14

14

00:00:31,919  -->  00:00:33,870
process is slightly different. We've run
15

15

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:35,730
the Linux machine follow along because
16

16

00:00:35,730  -->  00:00:38,250
you're in the right place. Alright so the
17

17

00:00:38,250  -->  00:00:40,050
first thing we want to do is open up a
18

18

00:00:40,050  -->  00:00:41,820
command window, so I'm just going to open
19

19

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:46,890
a terminal, let's go in to bring that in
20

20

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:48,329
and just enlarge it a little bit and
21

21

00:00:48,329  -->  00:00:50,789
what we'll do first is we'll do a sudo
22

22

00:00:50,789  -->  00:00:55,710
space apt - get space update, this will
23

23

00:00:55,710  -->  00:00:57,719
update the package index type in your
24

24

00:00:57,719  -->  00:01:04,080
password, another moment to complete,
25

25

00:01:04,080  -->  00:01:05,339
you can see that was pretty quick so next
26

26

00:01:05,339  -->  00:01:06,810
thing we're going to do now is type sudo
27

27

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:15,259
space add - apt - repository space ppa colon
28

28

00:01:15,259  -->  00:01:22,399
webupd8team forward slash java
29

29

00:01:22,399  -->  00:01:27,259
give that a moment to complete as enter
30

30

00:01:27,259  -->  00:01:30,450
once that's finished, we a sudo space
31

31

00:01:30,450  -->  00:01:36,939
apt - get space update.
32

32

00:01:36,939  -->  00:01:38,590
Once it's finished, we're going to do
33

33

00:01:38,590  -->  00:01:44,490
sudo space apt - get space install space
34

34

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:51,939
Oracle space Java 8 - installer and
35

35

00:01:51,939  -->  00:01:54,009
it'll go to press yes there, select yes
36

36

00:01:54,009  -->  00:01:56,259
and press enter or select why I should
37

37

00:01:56,259  -->  00:01:59,200
say type it anyway and then we going to
38

38

00:01:59,200  -->  00:02:00,580
go through this little configuration
39

39

00:02:00,580  -->  00:02:03,610
guide, so I'm going to press enter and do
40

40

00:02:03,610  -->  00:02:05,740
we accept the Oracle binary code license
41

41

00:02:05,740  -->  00:02:07,299
terms? Yes to that, I'm going to press
42

42

00:02:07,299  -->  00:02:11,080
enter, you can see that they're going
43

43

00:02:11,080  -->  00:02:15,250
away downloading the JDK, so give that a
44

44

00:02:15,250  -->  00:02:16,450
moment to complete I'm just going to
45

45

00:02:16,450  -->  00:02:18,100
fast forward this video to the end of
46

46

00:02:18,100  -->  00:02:21,330
the download.
47

47

00:02:21,330  -->  00:02:23,710
Now the download complete, you can see it's
48

48

00:02:23,710  -->  00:02:27,280
just finishing the configuration and
49

49

00:02:27,280  -->  00:02:28,210
that's now complete,
50

50

00:02:28,210  -->  00:02:30,370
and what we'll do now is we'll type in
51

51

00:02:30,370  -->  00:02:33,210
sudo space update
52

52

00:02:33,210  -->  00:02:39,070
- alternatives two minus signs, two dashes in
53

53

00:02:39,070  -->  00:02:42,820
other words, config space Java and you
54

54

00:02:42,820  -->  00:02:44,890
can see that there's an option there,
55

55

00:02:44,890  -->  00:02:46,930
we can select any of those but the correct
56

56

00:02:46,930  -->  00:02:48,790
option is showing for me you can see
57

57

00:02:48,790  -->  00:02:52,060
that it shows Java 8 Oracle, so depending
58

58

00:02:52,060  -->  00:02:53,500
on your installation of Linux, you might
59

59

00:02:53,500  -->  00:02:56,350
have other versions of the Java
60

60

00:02:56,350  -->  00:02:59,290
open JDK or a different version of Java
61

61

00:02:59,290  -->  00:03:01,150
so you could select the relevant option,
62

62

00:03:01,150  -->  00:03:03,160
but in this case the default option is
63

63

00:03:03,160  -->  00:03:04,870
correct and we're good to go
64

64

00:03:04,870  -->  00:03:07,570
so I'm just going to press ENTER then to
65

65

00:03:07,570  -->  00:03:09,670
not do anything and the last thing to do
66

66

00:03:09,670  -->  00:03:14,530
is to type in Java space -v, will try
67

67

00:03:14,530  -->  00:03:21,970
and -- version, Java space - version that's what I was
68

68

00:03:21,970  -->  00:03:23,590
trying to do the first time and that
69

69

00:03:23,590  -->  00:03:25,780
deal confirms that I would successfully
70

70

00:03:25,780  -->  00:03:28,270
installed Java and you can see that it
71

71

00:03:28,270  -->  00:03:29,650
shows that we're running in this
72

72

00:03:29,650  -->  00:03:31,500
particular case build
73

73

00:03:31,500  -->  00:03:34,090
25.1 44 or you can see on the previous
74

74

00:03:34,090  -->  00:03:36,880
line up here build one point 8.0
75

75

00:03:36,880  -->  00:03:39,460
underscore 144. So this number here may
76

76

00:03:39,460  -->  00:03:42,220
be different for you, 144 indicates the
77

77

00:03:42,220  -->  00:03:44,890
build release of in this case, the
78

78

00:03:44,890  -->  00:03:47,470
Java development kit version 8, but the
79

79

00:03:47,470  -->  00:03:49,840
point is that we're good to go, so let's
80

80

00:03:49,840  -->  00:03:50,890
know downloaded it and installed
81

81

00:03:50,890  -->  00:03:53,170
correctly and what we can do, we'll check
82

82

00:03:53,170  -->  00:03:55,300
that Java is on there we can type in Java C
83

83

00:03:55,300  -->  00:03:58,450
which is a Java compiler just to
84

84

00:03:58,450  -->  00:03:59,740
confirm that that actually worked and
85

85

00:03:59,740  -->  00:04:01,060
that's part on the Java development kit
86

86

00:04:01,060  -->  00:04:03,010
and if you see that, let's come up as
87

87

00:04:03,010  -->  00:04:05,230
well and if we wanted to we could do the
88

88

00:04:05,230  -->  00:04:09,520
same thing with the version, so obviously
89

89

00:04:09,520  -->  00:04:11,200
one point eight point zero underscore
90

90

00:04:11,200  -->  00:04:12,880
one four four, so in other words we've
91

91

00:04:12,880  -->  00:04:14,160
got our Java development kit installed
92

92

00:04:14,160  -->  00:04:16,690
and we can proceed down and move on to
93

93

00:04:16,690  -->  00:04:19,290
the next video.
