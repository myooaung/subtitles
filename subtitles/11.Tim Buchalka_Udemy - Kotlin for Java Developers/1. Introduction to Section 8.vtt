00:00:04.740  -->  00:00:07.259
In this section, we'll take a look at how
2

2

00:00:07.259  -->  00:00:10.860
to do file i/o and Kotlin now Kotlin
3

3

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:12.990
doesn't have its own i/o classes, so this
4

4

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:15.260
isn't going to be a long section as
5

5

00:00:15.260  -->  00:00:17.880
usual, we'll focus on what Kotlin has
6

6

00:00:17.880  -->  00:00:21.120
added to what exists in Java and you'll
7

7

00:00:21.120  -->  00:00:23.430
see how you can write some code in a
8

8

00:00:23.430  -->  00:00:26.340
more concise way. We'll also take a look
9

9

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:29.039
at walking the file tree, we'll just take
10

10

00:00:29.039  -->  00:00:30.240
a brief look at that
11

11

00:00:30.240  -->  00:00:33.270
because Kotlin does have some classes
12

12

00:00:33.270  -->  00:00:35.670
and extension functions that make
13

13

00:00:35.670  -->  00:00:38.579
walking the file tree very convenient.
14

14

00:00:38.579  -->  00:00:41.300
So let's get started.
