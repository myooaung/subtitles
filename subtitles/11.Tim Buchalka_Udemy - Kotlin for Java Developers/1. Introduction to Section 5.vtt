00:00:04.710  -->  00:00:07.500
You've learned quite a lot about Kotlin
2

2

00:00:07.500  -->  00:00:09.870
already and you could write programs,
3

3

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:12.000
but without the fundamental building blocks
4

4

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:14.340
of an object-oriented program, you won't
5

5

00:00:14.340  -->  00:00:17.310
get very far, so in this section we're
6

6

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:20.100
going to take a closer look at classes
7

7

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:25.250
and functions and constructors and
8

8

00:00:25.250  -->  00:00:28.590
extending Kotlin classes, implementing
9

9

00:00:28.590  -->  00:00:31.619
Kotlin interfaces overwriting functions,
10

10

00:00:31.619  -->  00:00:34.800
all the good object-oriented stuff.
11

11

00:00:34.800  -->  00:00:37.140
We're also going to cover naming conventions
12

12

00:00:37.140  -->  00:00:39.480
and how to import all this stuff when
13

13

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:43.610
you want to use it. So let's get started.
