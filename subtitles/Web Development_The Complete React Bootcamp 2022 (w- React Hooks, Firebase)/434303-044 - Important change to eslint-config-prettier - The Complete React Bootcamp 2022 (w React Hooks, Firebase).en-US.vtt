Hey, in the next video,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.010
we will configure a prettier and Eastland in our React project?

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.920
Yes, LinkedIn prettier constantly published new changes

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.010
and these changes have affected our ES LinkedIn pre-clear

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
configuration years lean conflict prettier version 8 has published

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.625
new changes that require us to update the ES lint conflict we use,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.465
you have to do the following for each project we will create.

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:26.445
This is very important.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:32.430
What we have to do is to just open ES lint RC file located in the root folder,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.890
find the line that starts with extends.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.805
It should be located at the top.

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:39.665
Remove preacher slash react from the list.

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:44.540
The preacher slash react part was merged into the main preacher conflicts,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.075
so we don't need to include it anymore.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.180
Then find the rules section below.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.725
In this rules section,

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:59.480
we have to disable two rules that were disabled by default in prior versions,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.760
but now we have to do it manually.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.235
So we need to disable Aero body style and prefer arrow callback rules,

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.995
save the file and restart the application.

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:14.360
After that, everything will run smoothly and without any errors.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.020
See you.
