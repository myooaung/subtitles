00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Hello.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.980
This section is dedicated to real time notifications and cloud functions.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.710
Real time notifications are implemented with fire based cloud messaging that require custom

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.960
back.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.160
And that's why we use cloud functions.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.850
In order for us to continue,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.250
we need to update our fire race project to the blaze plant with recent firebase pricing

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.570
updates from now on,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.560
called functions require blaze plan as the use some of Google cloud services that are not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.500
available in free Platt Blaze plan is passed.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.960
You go moto and it doesn't mean that we must pay.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.530
All of these services are given with really generals.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.170
Preacher,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.460
trust me with the given quotas,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.370
you will never heat the paying border but it's totally up to you.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100
Please read more about blaze Plan on fire base pricing page to operate to the blaze plan.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.030
Go to firebase dashboard,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.850
Click on upgrade at the bottom and select blaze plan.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.170
If you don't have payment source yet,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.120
Google will ask you for your car details and after that it will update the project to check

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.710
what plan?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.090
Cutting project uses.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.880
Just look at the left bottom.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
Now we're all said in the next video,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.040
we're gonna talk about cloud functions and server less architectures.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.110
See you there
