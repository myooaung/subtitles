00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Hello.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.860
Let's talk about Firebase cloud messaging.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.410
What's that exactly?

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.230
Cloud messaging allows us to sand real time notifications to users.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.700
If we are on the website,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.010
we can get a notification pop up out of nowhere.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.350
If the website and browser are closed,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.180
we can get OS native notifications on mobile.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.520
It will be a notification as if it was a real mobile application under the hood,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.780
it uses browsers,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.190
Boucher,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.250
FBI and the main drawback that it has limited support and browsers and some operating

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.010
systems.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.930
Okay,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.450
let me explain the full cycle off firebase cloud messaging.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
So each user has a unique token that represents users device.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
We get this token from user and store it inside the database.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.970
This token should not be publicly available later on.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.160
Fire Base will use that token to send a notification to users device to receive

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.940
notification on the device.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.080
We're gonna set up a service worker.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.320
As you remember.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.750
It is a middleman script that sits inside the browser.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.650
Settlers workers are often used to pro to some background tasks.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.250
Notifications are a good example.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.310
It will intercept incoming message and using browsers.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.330
Bush ap I It will display the notification.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.340
For fact.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.090
Now you know how it works.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.290
In the next video,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.700
we will get to the goat.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.750
See you that
