00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
Hello.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.610
Now that we have messages inside our database and we have lust message property available

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.420
on chat room data,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.390
we can display this last message inside chatroom list Inside room element.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.250
Let's do it.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.740
Let's navigate back to code and let's open room item component here at the top,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.000
where we d structure around properties.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.120
Let's also d structure last message than first here inside time ago instead of displaying

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.300
you date created at Let's ask,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900
if we have lost message data,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.300
then we're gonna display new date off last message created at so when this message was

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.780
created.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.110
Otherwise we will keep it as it was before we gonna display when the room was created,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.770
then here below,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.300
where we display no messages.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.670
Yet instead of that,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.930
let's poor conditional rendering.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.150
So if we have last message,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
then we're gonna display last message markup.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.450
Otherwise,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.250
it will be as before.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.820
We're going to display span.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.950
No messages yet.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.180
So inside this react fragment,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.690
we're gonna put First user Avatar and then the actual message.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.750
So this def is going to be rapper for profile avatar component that we created earlier as

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.420
you remember.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.740
So let's import it and for props.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.990
Let's specify source is going to be last message.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.150
Let's take a look.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.000
Last message Daughter author Nora al atar dot author Lord Avatar Name in case if Avatar is

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.470
not defined is going to be last message Author dot name and size is going to be smoke.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.790
And for this deaf let's pour to display Flex and a line item center.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.720
You make sure that avatar element is 10 to read vertically.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.750
Then next you decide if let's get rid off this bark for react fragment next to this profile

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.550
avatar.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.480
Let's display another deaf with class name tags disappear to prevent attacks from overflow

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.010
and margin left.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.910
Let's put you inside.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.250
We're gonna put def.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.510
That will say last message dot author dot name.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.270
And next year after name,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.430
we're gonna poor span.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.610
Last message,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.730
dog text and toward this author name,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.760
we gonna display text italic just to distinguish between author name and last message.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.290
All right,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.850
let's save everything.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.510
Let's not get back to our application.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.130
I can see that unexpected.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.640
All right,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.340
so again,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.750
this react fragment buck.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.300
Now,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.950
if I say what I can see that I have the actual message.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.680
I can see author name.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.830
I can see my message and I can see my Ah litter.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.960
Now maybe.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.850
Let's try a new message.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.060
So let me say hello from future.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.880
If I send this message,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.440
I can see that message has been sent.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.710
Just now again,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.560
my avatar,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.510
my name and hello from future.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.950
All right,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.120
so this is it.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.250
It was pretty easy,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.660
right?

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.150
Let's commit our changes.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.620
Let's put everything to get system and let's commit by saying display last message inside

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.590
room item,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.400
for fact.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.700
See you in the next one.
