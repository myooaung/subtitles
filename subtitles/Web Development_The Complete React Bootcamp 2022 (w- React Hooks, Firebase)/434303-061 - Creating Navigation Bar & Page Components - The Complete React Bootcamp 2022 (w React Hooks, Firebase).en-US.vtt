00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
Hey,

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.180
welcome in this video,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.330
we will continue with react rotor.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.700
We will create navigation bar and also bubble create corresponding components for our pages

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.700
.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.630
Let's go.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.050
So to create a navigation bar,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.250
let's first define our component.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.890
So on the source,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.500
we will create in your folder components as before.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.390
And here we will put a new file allows GS.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.470
So it is going to be a D attack.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.000
And inside we will pour you l and Attempts is going to be l i with our a link with our

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.680
navigational ing two pages.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.550
So in order to use it with react router,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.950
we need to import another component from react router,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.690
which is going to be It is going to be a link,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.220
and it is just a wrapper around the Angkor attack.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.650
But in order to use it with reactor,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.720
we need to use it this way.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.310
We can just use the Angkor attack and then put the euro.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.860
So this is not how it works with the actual trick.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.300
We need to use this link component.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.610
So we're gonna put link and inside.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.380
Let's say go to start page,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.840
and it expects only one necessary prop which is two and here was specified the path.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.310
So it will lead us to the start page.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.590
Well,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.820
right now I saved it.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.420
And inside Abner gs,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.060
let's use it.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.350
So I will wrap the app component.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190
I will put it deep inside like that.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.550
And right before the switch component,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.810
we will put our naps component and we need to import it here.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.760
So let's put import now from components in house.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.380
All right,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.600
When I save it,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.200
if I go back to my app and I can see that I haven't go to start page and right at the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.210
bottom on the left,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.180
you can see that if I have her on it,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.410
it already proposes me the link.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.610
So when I click on it,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.350
I switched between pages.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.850
All right,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.450
that's fine.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.490
But how?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.290
We are able to create all all our links for all our pages.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.740
Well,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.080
we need to do it manually.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.740
But we will not do it in this way,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.130
will not repeat ourselves.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.730
So what?

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.730
We're going to dio we're going to define an array and then we will map every array item to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.880
this ally element.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.520
So we're going to create let's say links and then we will pour away and every item is going

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.300
to be an object with the two props.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.180
So it will say to So first we will have our home route.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.620
Then we will have text which will define the text inside the link.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.130
So it is going to be,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.680
let's say home and then second element is going to be start with the text set to start like

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.010
that.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.350
Now what we will do inside this UL we will pour links dot map.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.350
Then I Tim,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.560
a memorable map these links to ally elements and inside the l.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.200
I will put this link and inside this link,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.260
instead of this start,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:28.650
we will pour item dodge to and instead of text but will put item dot text and here because

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.470
we map elements.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.660
Don't forget to put the key proper to the rapper element which is mapped element.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.810
So key is going to be item dot to,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.670
because it is going to be unique.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.540
So now if I save it,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.850
I can see that.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.410
All right,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.870
I have my navigation,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.470
and that's basically this is how you should do the navigation with react router.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.240
You define routes and then you simply display the bar.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.960
All right,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.760
now what we are going to do next Now we need to create components for our pages instead of

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.130
just this is home page.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.150
This is start.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.540
So under source,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.650
we are going to create a new folder,

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.900
will name its pages.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.580
And here we will put also components.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.430
But let's say top level components which will represent our pages.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.450
And this structure is totally up to us,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.100
and we are the only one who make decisions.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.150
But this is just my preferred way to split components like that.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.100
So I put like page components to patient folder and then every other components.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.900
I pour other components for her,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.300
so he will create to off them.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.160
So home the GS and then we will create starred the G s.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.860
So home is going to be simply a D.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.240
For now,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.560
we will put this is home and the same actually applies to the start page.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.050
Where we'll put this is start like from that.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.040
Now,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.520
if I go to Abdul gs instead of just using this is home page,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.490
I will use my home page component.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.700
And because of the intelligence.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.290
It was automatically imported for me.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.850
And the same applies to start.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.470
So you see,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.770
I have this intelligence.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.470
And when I press in the tap,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.080
key it out a medical imports to this page for me,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.840
and this is it.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.740
Maybe let's change it a little bit.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.180
Also,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.550
we will put just a simple diva and let's say not found something like that.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.180
And yeah,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.700
it seems like everything is all right.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.310
Now we have the navigation and we define components for our pages.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.760
Everything looks clean.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.530
All right,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.480
Let's commit our changes and finish the video.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.450
So we will put get at everything and then get commits.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.380
End it now bar and created page components.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.890
All right,

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.350
cool.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.010
So for this video,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.970
we're finished.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.550
We'll see you in the next one.
