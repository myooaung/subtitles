Hello.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.340
Now you know all modern stuff needed to create a large production ready react application.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.590
Give it a little more practice and you will definitely muster everything that we've covered

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.590
.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.080
Here is a task for you.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.250
Go through react documentation and rely on topics that you haven't heard during the course

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.250
.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.820
There are lots off subtle details that are unseen at the first glass.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.540
Make sure you understand why you're using this technique.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.560
As for now,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.140
we are finished with this section.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.750
See you in the next one.
