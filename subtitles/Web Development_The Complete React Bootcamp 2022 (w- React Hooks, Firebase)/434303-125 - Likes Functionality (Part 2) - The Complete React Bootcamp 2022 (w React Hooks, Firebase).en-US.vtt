00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Hey there in this video bubble,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.510
add functionality to the like button.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.420
Let's go.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.400
Let's first navigate to the database and let's see how we're going to handle our data

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.030
structure.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.150
So inside every message element,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.750
we're going to create two new more properties.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.540
First Property is going to be like Count that will indicate the total number off likes on

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.950
this particular message.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.350
And then we will have,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.450
Let's say,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.880
likes it will be an array off values with the user ID's that liked this message.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.790
But instead of storing and Ray were going to use an object the same way as we did with

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.390
Rooms admits,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.080
let's navigate to the app.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.970
And here let's open first message item.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.140
Here we will receive handle like function and this handle like function.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.180
We will pass it to this own click handler here.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.120
We're going to call this handle like and for handle,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.150
like we're going to pass message dot i d.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.730
Okay,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.340
now let's navigate to bottom in textile gs And here when we create and you message,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.450
we're gonna attach a new property like count,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.660
and by default it will be set to zero.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.210
Okay,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.670
now let's navigate to messages to index dodgy s.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.230
And here,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.300
let's define Const handle like handler lets rapper in.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.230
He was called back in advance.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.820
And now let's define our logic.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.110
We're gonna pass it to message item on the like candlelight,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.160
so it will receive message I d.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.920
And the logic actually will be quite the same as with the handle admin because we're going

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410
to use a transaction.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.040
So let's actually caught be everything from here and let's put it inside handle like but

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.100
instead of advance,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.550
ref,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.340
we're going to poor message,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.140
ref and message Ref is going to be database Ralf than messages.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.860
And then instead of chat idea,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.410
we're gonna use message I d.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.050
Okay,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.800
then we need to also convert this function to in a sink function for transaction instead of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.890
admits we will receive message.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:19.230
Then we're gonna ask if message exists then if message dot likes and message Dar likes you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.230
,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.240
I d off our current user.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.860
So let's grab it from other object.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.070
Let's use off current user and we will get you i d.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.130
So if we have,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.930
like by this particular user,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.920
then we're going to first delete this like and also we want to decrease our like Joan.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.860
So let's fix it to message Dog likes.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.030
Then we're going to decrease,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.450
like,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.090
count by one.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.070
So let's boy,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.920
my nose equals one.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.120
An alert message is going to be,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.140
like removed.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.580
Okay?

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.190
Otherwise,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.070
when we want to pour and you like,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.660
we're gonna put a message like Conan Plus equals one and because we can have this likes

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.920
object said,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.440
you know,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.850
it can be non existent inside databases community also handled that.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.860
And if we try to add something to non existen object,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.810
we will get an error.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.190
So first we gonna ask if no message likes.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.490
So if we don't have this object,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.150
then we will initialize it as an empty object.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.850
So message likes is going to be an empty object.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.450
And only then we will be able to set message.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.400
DOT likes your i d equals to truth.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.130
And then message is going to be like at it.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.730
Okay,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.390
Perfect.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.850
Now let's say wait and let's take a look.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.250
If we will try to click on this message,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.350
we will have transaction failed,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.840
and this is because it tries to update like,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.480
count,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.090
non existent property for existing messages.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.620
So what I proposed to do,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.540
I want to village all of this passage is just to clean up database a little bit.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.880
So now we're able to put a new message with the new properties.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.150
So let's put a new message.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.310
And now it has five like Count and we can actually fix this.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.360
But for now,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.700
if we click on it and we can see,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.030
like,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.900
edit if we go to database,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.780
if we open our message,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.480
we can see,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.400
like count one and likes contains our user i d.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.280
And if we click on it one more time,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.210
we can see likes is diluted and,

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.480
like,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.880
count such to Zito.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.100
Okay,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.600
Perfect.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.400
Now let's actually fix our you I Let's not forget to message item here.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.760
We need to pass props,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.270
Teoh,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.850
I can be in control.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.980
So first of all,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.940
when we have color off red when our message is liked,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.350
right,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:50.430
So let's poor is light valuable that will create here at the top const his life and how we

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.300
can define that.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.510
So first we need to see if this message has any likes.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.950
So let's grab,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.930
likes and like count from our message.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.100
And here we're gonna ask if our message has any likes.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.970
Then we're gonna put object keys off.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.900
These likes to get array off user ideas and then we can poor includes,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.080
Let's say off Dar current user,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.680
don't you?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.580
I d So in this way we can detect if our message is liked by this particular user.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.050
Okay,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.430
so then we're gonna pass.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.850
This is liked to weaken displayed here.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.560
We're gonna put it inside the condition,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.230
and then we're gonna put color red.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.870
Okay,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.670
then we have this is visible property.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.420
And this is for actual for responsiveness off our messages.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.270
So if we recites our window,

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.420
we end up on mobile devices.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.040
So on mobile devices,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.540
we don't want to hide our icons.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.550
We want to display them always.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.580
So for this,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.130
we can use use media query to detect that.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.060
So first,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.740
let's put it here right below use hover we're gonna put is mobile.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.550
And then we're gonna use Media Query,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.420
and we're gonna ask if we have marks with off 992 pixels.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.970
So if we have is mobile,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.910
let's actually create new viable.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:24.040
That we will say can show Aiken's So if we have is mobile or if our current element is

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.950
hovered so we will see them Only when we have her on the message Only then we can display

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.460
Aikens so for is visible We're gonna pull can show I comes for on click We're gonna pour

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.120
and the like And for bench content instead of five we're gonna put our current like count

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.420
Okay,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.810
good.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.800
Now let's take a look If we have where we can see,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.040
we have icon If we resize the window And if we are on mobile devices were able to see the

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.460
Eiken.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.010
Okay,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.680
Perfect.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.650
Now if I click on this like message,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.900
I can see like count and as well it is being displayed in color off red.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.690
This is it.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.370
And it looks pretty cool.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.630
Any fire size again?

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.550
Back to my bile.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.890
I can see it always.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.710
This is it.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.980
And I guess let's commit our changes.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:18.000
Let me open my terminal lead Poor get at everything than could commit Handle message likes

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.580
Okay,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.450
Perfect.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.700
See you in the next one
