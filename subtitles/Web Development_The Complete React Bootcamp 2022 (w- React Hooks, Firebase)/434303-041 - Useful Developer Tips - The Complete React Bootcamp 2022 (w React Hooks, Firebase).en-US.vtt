00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Hey, before we start,

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:03.315
I just want to give you

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.420
a few small tips that you should always remember.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.270
First tip, always read the output,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.290
whether it is a command in the terminal browser console,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.500
error messages or anything that can be printed out,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.395
seeing what gets printed by the tools and

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.720
reading error messages will always give you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.675
the understanding on what is going on.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.510
Not able to access local development server,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.640
look in the terminal application,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.920
does something weird or crashes.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.225
Look in the browser,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.475
it is important to start to

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:38.245
leverage the environment you're working in.

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:43.099
Second tip, always read documentation of a tool, service,

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:46.160
or library you are using that I want to be always

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.415
someone who can show or a guide you how to use that tool.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.630
You will have to work with

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.970
libraries that you have never seen before.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.940
The only way for you to understand what is going

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.000
on is to read the official documentation.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.055
Ability to read and understand

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.140
documentation of a tool that you're

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.579
using is one of the main keys to become good developer.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.695
For example, ES lint.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:13.850
Don't be afraid to look at the official ES lint Docs.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.200
Everything is explained.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.880
There was good examples.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.725
Third tip, google.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:20.945
Google is going to be your coding,

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:23.615
but the number one without Google,

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:27.065
majority of developers wouldn't be developers.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:30.770
Every developer, whether it is a beginner or a senior,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.605
all use Google to find answers,

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:34.865
got an error message,

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:38.074
copy pasted into Google and search for a solution,

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:39.875
looking for a new reacts tools,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.275
search for the latest articles written by

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:45.170
other people without ability to Google,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.574
you're going to struggle a lot outside of our projects.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.675
You will have to become independent.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:53.630
And some point, just like I mentioned earlier,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.370
there will be always someone who

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.185
can guide you for that reason.

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.170
But remember that you always have Google.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.970
That's all for the tips.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.375
Trust me, they will make you a better developer.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.110
Cia.
