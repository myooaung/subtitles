00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Hey there.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.730
In this video,

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.640
people manage our role based security on particular fills.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.510
When we try to add it.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.040
Room information,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.720
Let's go.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.270
So,

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.040
first of all,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.420
how we're going to define our roles.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.010
If we open our structure inside rooms,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.080
we can see we have created at description,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.420
last message and name.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.010
So here we will also add another property,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.500
which is going to be admits.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.170
And with real time data base,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.570
we can poor a race or we can.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.940
But they are really poorly managed because off its poor query builder system,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.660
because off its poor queries on real time database,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.150
we're gonna put our Edmonds as an array off user ID's.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.070
So if user belongs to this array,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.060
it means that user is an admin and will not put it as an array.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.430
We're going to create an object inside our database,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.520
and every key is going to be user i d.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.100
And if this user is an admin,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.670
then it will be set to true advise.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.040
This user will not be inside the database.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.800
All right,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.350
So first of all,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.590
what we need to do,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.950
we need to add a user to our data.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.220
Let's go to,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.670
let's say new room name.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.990
Or maybe let's rename it to something more specific.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.210
Let's say cool,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.210
let's save it.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
And now let's navigate through this data base here.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.420
We're gonna add new field we're gonna create admits than we're going to click on plus sign

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.250
over here.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.060
Then we need to put our user I d What we can do,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.440
we can go to profile context.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.700
And then when we get off object,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.710
let's Consul Accuser i d to get our user i d.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.570
So now I can caught me by user I d and put it inside database and then sat value to true

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.370
and then edit to room data So it looks like this.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.780
Now,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660
in order to restrict access,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.980
we need to define security rules,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.380
so lets navigate to rules.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.250
And here we will do the next thing for our rooms path.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.300
We're gonna remove right property so it will be picked up from here so no one can actually

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.270
right two rooms path,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.870
but they are able to read rooms than for room I d.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.500
Instead,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.270
off write it like this.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.980
We cannot recreate the rule,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.320
but also for last message property,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.460
which is like this.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.050
We get us pacify,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.530
right?

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.140
Rule said to off not equals No,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.180
Let me for mud it like this.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.200
This is due to if you remember,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.810
when we update data in multiple places,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.830
we also update last message inside our room.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.750
So basically,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.430
everyone who writes to chat can update last message inside the room but not other fields

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.770
like room,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.860
name and description.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.040
Here we will define models for exactly those feels so for room idee,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.680
we are able to write data first when the data does not exist.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.600
When we try to create and you room,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.760
we're gonna specify if data.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.160
So this data is again a global object inside security rules and it represents the current

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.150
data that we're trying to access.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.030
So if data exists so it is a bowline were able to write to these past when data does not

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.670
exist.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.250
Alright,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.440
So when we're trying to create a new room with the specific room I d,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.990
or if we are an admin,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.080
only then we will be able to write and edit this information.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.240
So how can we do that?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.920
So we know that we store it under add men's then we have user I d and true.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.540
So with database with security rules,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.500
it works like that.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.350
I opened documentation for real time data,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.370
basically rituals.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.970
And here I confined this information.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.020
If I scroll down a little bit,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.590
I can find this information that I can access some filled by using this approach.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.390
So I'm gonna just use exactly the same pattern and what I will do.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.140
I'm gonna ask if data that we're currently trying to access has child admissions.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.030
Then inside this at Mons Child,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.170
we have another child which is going to be our user.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.690
I d.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.450
And we can get it from both object.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.750
So we're gonna ask if child off dot your i d dot value equals two.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.220
True.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.220
So if we have a record for our user inside Edmunds filled,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.590
then we will be able to write to that path.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.830
Now,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.070
let's save it and let's take a look.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.520
Now,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.650
if I am an admin off this cold group,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.150
I'm going to click on that.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.310
I will be able to edit it because we edit our user I d to the database.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.940
Let's say something random now successfully update it.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.630
OK,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.440
now let's navigate to other room When we are not an admin,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.970
Let me try and edit it.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.350
Hello world.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.840
Now if I will try and savor,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.430
I will get permission tonight So our security rules work and that's pretty cool.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.590
And because of that now we restricted access to our database.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.400
But also we need to manage it programmatically we need to add men's etcetera.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.340
So let's also do that.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.600
So let's navigate to create room,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.650
beach hand model.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.530
And here water will do.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.950
When we will create a new room,

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.990
we will add ourselves to add men's.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.830
So here,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.050
when we define in your,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.190
um,

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.750
data,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.510
we will also add a new object added beans.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.980
And we're going to specify us.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.310
Let's import off in the first place.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.760
Yeah,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.600
it has been imported off current user,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.370
your I d is set to true.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.720
Now,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.460
whenever we add in your room,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.850
we set ourselves as admin.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.530
Next,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.830
when we read room data,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.270
we need to know who exactly are Adnan's.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.770
So lets navigate to Chatel gs and here for a current room.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.160
We're gonna do the next thing because it is an object and we need to work with I raise

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.750
Ideally,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.490
when we work inside our code,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.260
we need to transform this object to an array.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.110
So let's create here.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.300
New,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.560
valuable ad mons and inside helpers.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.490
We will define a new function that will transform our object to just an array.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.020
So we will name it in exactly the same way as we did with this function.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.980
But we're going to say,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.050
just transform to array here.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.780
We're going to receive snapshot value again and let me defined function keyboard,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.160
and this function will be pretty simple.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160
So if Snapshot 12 exist,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.530
then we're going to return object keys off this snapshot value so we will get an array off

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.390
user ID's.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.140
Otherwise,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.940
begin a return and empty Right Now let's say this helpers and let's use it inside.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.150
Chatterjee s here.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.490
We're gonna transform to array.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.520
Let's say current room door Adnan's And now we have the administrative.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.610
But also we want to know if we're currently signed in user is an admin.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.120
So what?

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.670
We came to you.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:26.750
We can create a new valuable is admin and we're gonna just simply ask if admissions

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:33.550
includes off that current user dot your i d and how we can pass it this data along with the

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.350
context.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.190
So let's pass,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.450
admits and is admin.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.430
From now on,

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:44.670
we will be able to display this drover Onley when we are admits.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.550
So now let's navigate Teoh our top part.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.650
Let's navigate to index togs inside top folder and hear from context.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.740
We're going to grab his admin use current room value.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.710
Value is admin like that.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.140
And now we're gonna ask if we are an admin Onley,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.450
then we will display at its room Bt and Drover.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.090
Now let's take a look inside this first room where we are the admin.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.660
We can see this Drover,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.080
and we are able to add it.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.210
Room information successfully updated.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.200
But in the room where we are not admits,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.010
we will not be able to see this Drover.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.380
And also we will not be able to update it because we said security rules.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.730
Let's actually copied the security rules.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.580
And let's synchronizing them with ah,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.990
war locals.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.300
Let's open data base rules and paste them here.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:40.820
All right.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.830
It seems good.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.580
Have that where there is one more thing to our security rules.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.850
If we inspect our council,

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.320
we can see that we have this firebase warning your data will be doing lower and filter it

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.000
on decline.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.650
Consider ending index on on the room idea at messages.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.960
So let's do that.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.710
That's to make our queries even more performance.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.420
So lets navigate to rules.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.830
And,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.630
let's see,

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.700
consider adding index on room I d.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.780
At messages.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.290
Let's copy this.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.360
And that message is Let's add it over here like this.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.430
Now let's savor and let's take a look if we can still have this warning,

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.820
okay?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.280
Right now,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.260
our council is clear.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.810
I don't see any warning.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.640
Let's again copy our rules and let's paste them.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.170
Teoh,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.580
our database rules,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.960
Jason like that.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.470
Okay,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.580
so this is it for this video.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.460
This is how we will manage our security.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.510
Now let's commit our changes.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.930
Let's at everything to the stage state.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:53.530
And then let's commit changes with the update security rules for role based permission.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.590
And that's all.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.360
All right,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.650
See you in the next one.
