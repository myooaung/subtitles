00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Hey,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.260
welcome to the new section.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.530
Did you take a break?

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.200
Because right now I'm gonna show you how our final project will look like when we first now

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.370
engaged to the website.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.340
But we'll see the sign in page.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.080
From here.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.310
We can continue either with Facebook or Google.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.690
Let's choose Google.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.930
Then I'm going to choose by second account and then I am inside the app.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.090
So on the left,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.810
I can see that board create new chatroom bottoms and list off chat rooms available on the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.160
right.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.560
If I click on either off chat rooms,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.450
I will see its messages and a few other things that we will cover just in a second.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020
Let's first start with dashboard,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.820
so if I click on it from here,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.350
I can manage my account.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.490
So at the top,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.120
I can see that right now I'm connected to Google,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.980
and I can also associate my account with Facebook.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.650
So if I click on a link to Facebook,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.860
it will prompt me for my phrasebook credentials if necessary.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.510
And right now I'm connected to phrasebook.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.190
It means that next time when I will look in with Facebook to buy app,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.720
I will be linked to this account.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.300
I will end up with the same account,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.510
then I have a nickname and I can edited from here.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.710
So if I click on edit button,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.650
I will be able to change it.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.530
So let's change it a little bit,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.930
and if I click safe,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.230
it will be updated.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.160
Also,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.660
I can edit my ometer if I click on Select New Avatar,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.250
and if I choose this image,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.580
I will be able to added it a little bit on develop state.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.160
And then I will click un uploaded and my Al Atar will be updated.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.880
And from here,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.540
I can also sign out.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.910
Next,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.400
we have create new chatroom button.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.030
So let's specify in Europe name,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.010
let's say whoa and description is going to be Whoa!

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.850
If I click on it,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760
it will appear over here,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.850
and the chatroom will be completely empty for now.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.080
So let's select the first chat room because it is already populated with some messages.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.510
So what do we have here?

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.900
So,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.860
on every message,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.050
if we have her on it,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.020
we can see this like button.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.350
It will show you how many likes this particular message half.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.360
So if I click on it,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.380
I will remove toe like if I click in again like will be added to this message.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.210
And also we can see if this user is online or offline.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.910
So if we have her on this circle,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.610
we can see that this user was offline on this particular day at this particular time.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.630
And this is my account.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.960
That's why I'm currently online.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.610
Also,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.740
would you have here if we click on user nickname Global Sea Motile window with its of a car

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.740
.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.940
It's full name Member since this date.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.200
So when this user joined the application and also we can control admin permission off this

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.950
user if we are currently an admin off this group,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.900
we will take a look at admin permission just in a moment.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.550
So what else do we have?

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.000
So all messages are split into dates.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.860
They are grouped by dates.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.600
So you can see today I send this message is yesterday there were these messages and so one

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.750
also we have pagination off.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.940
Message is it means that we do not lower all off our messages from the database.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.990
When we see the chat a load only,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.500
let's say 15 messages.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.660
And then when we click on load more,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.680
we will see more messages being loaded to our application.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.150
All right,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.990
so we are able to send normal text messages to our Chad.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.850
Then we also are able to send files.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.590
So if I click on attachment button,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.080
I will see this mortal.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.590
Then I click on upload.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.020
I can select normal files as well.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.790
Assim itches.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.830
So I'm gonna select this file,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.570
this image,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.790

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.110
It will appear over here that I'm gonna click,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.210
send to chat.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.040
And as you can see,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.300
if I send a normal file,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.250
I condone Load it by just clicking on this your out.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.540
If it is an image,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.350
it will be displayed over here.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.840
And if I click on it,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.050
I will see the preview.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.740
And also,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.730

the original will be opened in the new tap.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.400
Also,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.820
we are able to send audio files.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.250
So if I click on this button over here,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.980
the record ing will be started and I can see this I can.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.600
Over here,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.280
it means that currently it is record in my mic.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.760
So if I click on this button one more time,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.090
it will save my odio message.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.680
That was record it just right now.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.600
And I will be able to play it if it is supported by the browser.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.090
All right,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.980
What do we have else?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.150
So on the top,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.050
we can see room name,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.880
we can see broadcast message.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.050
And this blue button over here,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.340
they are related,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.140
but we'll take a look just in a moment.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.680
On that,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.850
we can click on room information to see description off this chat room.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.580
And also,

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.130
if we are an admin off this group,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.300
we are able to see this Aiken.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.770
So if we click on it,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.480
we can add it.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.620
Room information such as name and description.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.050
So if I click on edit button again,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.630

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.530
And then I'm able to save it,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.340
and it will be successfully updated.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.850
All right,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.710
So now,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.350
about broadcast messages.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.670
What are those?

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.600
Let me first show you how admit permission can be controlled.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.720
So let me actually look into these app from my phone,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.070
and I will remove admin permission.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.220
So right now I'm inside in the app,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.050
and you can see that the status has been changed.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.320
And right now I can see the green dark.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.050
All right,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.590
so I'm going to remove admin permission for this account that you can see right now.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.480
So what I will do?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.400
I will click on my profile and I will click room of Admit permission,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.710
but from my phone.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.250
So right now,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.760
I removed admin permission.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.030
And now I can only have this notification button and room information.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.480
All right,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.640
Now,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.960
I'm gonna give augment permission to myself,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.030
and you can see now it is updated and everything is in the real time.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.350
So what is happening here?

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.170
So first of all this notification button,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:43.230
So it means that I want to subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications that I will receive

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.420
from admits off this chat room.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.810
So right now,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.820
I am subscribed.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.420
And if I change my mind,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.820
I will be on subscribe,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.610
and I will receive no messages at all.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.250
So what are those notifications?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:04.030
These are real time notifications that are being displayed by browser on the device.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.650
So it is this permissions or notifications that if I click on this bottom,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.050
I can see notifications over here and right now they are allowed.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.750
So what is going to happen?

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:22.190
Let me send a notification from my phone to all users inside this chat room.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.420
So right now,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.630
from my phone,

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.480
I'm going to click on broadcast message here.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.940
I will specify title and message,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.590
and then I'm gonna publish message.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.370
So let's see what is going to happen.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.570
So I Steidl,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.770
I'm gonna select,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.560
Let's say web deaf and for message,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.230
I'm gonna type hello from phone and then publish message.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.960
And as you can see right now,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.500
I have this web half from this room.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.630
I help hello from my phone.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.250
And also I have this notification inside windows.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.190
So what?

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.950
It means that if I am currently on the website,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:08.130
I will receive this kind of notification that I can close if I let's say outside of the

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.130
browser or I just close the browser entirely.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.610
And if I receive a notification,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.180
let me send another one and yeah,

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.320
I can see that I will still have notification inside windows or inside your operating

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.950
system if it is supported.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:31.650
So this is what our riel time messages in this way you can not if I your users to engage

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:31.910
them.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.940
So this is pretty much it about our application,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.830
a lot of things to cover and I will make it as comprehensive as possible.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.340
I think you will enjoy it.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.950
And I'm going to see you in the next video.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.690
We will get started.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.570
See you there.
