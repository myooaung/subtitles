00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
Hey there.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.750
In this video,

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.760
we're going to display uploaded user audio records.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.220
And also,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.460
we're going to fix another problem that arise when we started to deal with file upload.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.250
Let's never get back to the code and let's open message item the place where we render our

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.760
element.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.670
So here we check against content file time.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.190
So let's add another if statement over here and we're gonna check against audios.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.240
So we're gonna ask a file.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.500
Content type includes audio.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.250
So if this is the case,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.700
we're gonna return an audio element so for this order will be able to use controls.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.080
And also let's poor source element it is going to be a self closing element.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.250
Source is going to be filed,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.820
Lord,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.740
your L and type is going to be odio MPA three.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.020
And if this is not supported by the browser,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.600
then we're gonna display your browser does not support the audio element.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.110
Okay?

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.950
And let's remove Odeon from here.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.150
And now we have this year slimmed warning media elements such as an audio must be must have

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.570
a track for captions.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.180
That's fine,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.720
but we don't have any cop shins.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.410
That's why we need to disable this warning.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.450
Let's do that.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.090
Let's save it and let's move this suppressor.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.930
Now we can see that we have this track so we can play it.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.140
I can hear my voice so it is actually working and that's it for audio messages.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.690
It was pretty simple right now about other problems that arise when we started to deal with

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.350
Philip O.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.080
When was ill ID the last message or one of the messages with files than we only do it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.420
message inside the database.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.460
But files from the storage is not being diluted.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.820
What I mean is that let me try and delete this older message.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.730
So if I delete that one that I go to storage,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.600
I refresh it.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.910
I can see it is steal their to fix that.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.470
We need to fix our coat.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.400
So lets navigate back to index togs.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.290
Inside message is the place where we deliver.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.510
Our message is so this is handled village function.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.840
So here we need to somehow also perform file delish in how wearable to do that.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.490
So inside message item when we call,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.260
let's find it.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.200
When we call handled,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.830
deleted,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.550
we pass message i D.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.080
However,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.660
we don't know whether this message has a file or it is just a text message.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.310
So let's also poor file to this handle delete function.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.690
So now we know that if there is any file so inside,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.590
how until the lid we will also receive file and right after we dill it message inside

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.310
database.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.390
We can also put another try,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.210
catch block over here,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.940
and we can do the next thing.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.660
So if we have filed,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.430
then we will put this Try catch block here inside,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.230
and we're gonna first grab the reference to that file inside firebase story so we can call

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.230
,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.830
Let's say,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.760
filed rough.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.870
We can call away storage than reference from your hell and does it return promise or not

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.150
know,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.040
it seems like not so reference from your L.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.670
And then we're going to specify file door,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.340
you're out.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.420
Then we can simply call file ref door dill it So this is definitely going to be a promise.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.020
And in case of any other,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.640
we're going to specify alert ever alert error.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.120
And here's a very important moment to catch.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.590
Let's imagine we delivering the message and this fails.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.100
So if that one fails.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.400
This will try and delete the message.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.390
So to make sure that if this fails,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.450
the next code will also fail.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.530
We need to return from these catch block whenever we have an error.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.150
So now we have this a sink at a function expected no return value.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.600
We can actually suppress the again the yes,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.480
Lind warning for the entire file.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.040
And now it looks fine.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.440
So let's first manually delete this odor message that we record it.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.850
And if I try and dilated the latest message over here,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.650
if I dilated message has been deleted.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.390
And if you look inside of my database,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.550
I have two images.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.550
But if I refresh now,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.520
I have only one.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.250
So everything was successfully fixed.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.710
Okay,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.650
now let's commit our changes.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.750
Let's get everything,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.020
then get commits.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:46.270
Let's say displayed audio messages and fix file delish in when message when message is

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.340
being delivered.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.560
All right.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.400
Perfect.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.850
See you in the next one.
