00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Hey, this is going to be a short one.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.950
I just want to clarify the difference

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.470
between a script and JavaScript.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.335
You probably saw a lot of terms such as

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.860
ES6 is five, ES 2015.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.185
After that video, you will know the difference.

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:17.639
To look for the answer,

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:20.115
I'll use Google and I'm just going to type

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:23.684
ECMO script or GS.

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:25.995
And Google will tell me the difference.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.830
So as we can see from the first pop-up,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.620
the ECMO script specification is

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.515
a blueprint for creating a scripting language.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:38.300
And JavaScript is an implementation of that blueprint.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.850
And you can see different variations of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.505
this statement across all of those link.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.590
To quickly summarize that statement,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.950
I can say that ECMO script is a set of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.655
specific cations that JavaScript implements.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:55.520
It means that AGMA script is some sort of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.284
a script for a movie where movie is JavaScript,

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:00.545
as easy as that.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.185
For more information, you can navigate

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.320
to Wikipedia page for ECMO script.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.510
So let me open that page and from

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.870
here we can see different versions of acme scrape.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.385
The most common version of

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.775
ACML script is probably yes, 2015,

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.775
which is called ES6 because

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:22.940
it was the sixth edition of ECMO script.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.245
If you scroll down,

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:25.940
you can read what exactly was

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.400
made on that specific version.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.770
And also there is a term called ES.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.850
Next, as you can see,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.284
this is a dynamic name that refers to whatever

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:39.185
the next version will include at the time of writing.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.915
Now we know that whoever refers to

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.215
JavaScript as ECMO script is a right person.

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:47.390
Because now we know that these

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.685
two are basically the same thing.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:50.825
I think that's it.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.940
For more information, please refer

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.175
to Wikipedia or a Google.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.360
See you in the next one.
