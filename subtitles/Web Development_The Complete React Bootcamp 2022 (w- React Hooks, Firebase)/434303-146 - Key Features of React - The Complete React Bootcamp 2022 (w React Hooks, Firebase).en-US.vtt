00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
Hey,

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.710
in this most section,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.300
we're gonna cover react features that almost every production regular react application has

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.300
.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.750
But we didn't have a chance to use them in our projects.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.610
Everything that will be covered here is going to be applied to our final project chat

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.540
application to help us with the code double reference official react documentation.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.550
I highly recommend you to read it yourself to better understand how react works.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.200
See you in the next video.
