00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
Hey,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.060
welcome.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.380
We finally finished the APP.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.150
We've done all functionality inside our game.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.120
Now the very final step is to complete the selling.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.330
So in this video we will do it.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.260
Let's go,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.300
Let's open the Assets folder And inside this folder we confined this silent entire app dot

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.070
txt.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.830
Inside,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.000
we will find references to a few files,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.370
so let's go one by one.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.890
First,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.360
we have had section in index HTML.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.030
So let's copy this and let's get back to our code and let's find index html in the root

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.530
folder and here,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.920
instead of this title,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.850
we will put the carpet text.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.070
So what we're doing,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.750
We said the Met attacks to make our application responsive on mobile devices than we also

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.490
import the Robert A.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.440
Google phoned and also we said the title.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.790
So now if we go back to our app,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.140
we can see this title at the top.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.680
So everything's fine.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.540
Now Let's go next and next We have root dot s yes,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.690
says so Let's copy everything until the very end,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.400
and we will open our route,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.380
Sus says,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.040
and we will replace everything here with what we just copied.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.640
So let's scroll to the top.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.290
And let's overview,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.550
What do we have here?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.480
So first we have the SAS potables defined that define our colors and who will use them a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.110
few times during this CSS file.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.980
And also let's inspect what classes we need to adjust for our current application.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.550
So we have the body,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.050
but and don't app.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.710
So next we have techniques green and text orange helper classes that will set colors with

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.700
the corresponding variables.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.390
All right,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.070
so let's use this classes.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.800
Let's open Abdel Gs.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.020
And here,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.480
inside this each one.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.050
We will wrap this tack toward in a span tack like that,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.560
and Rubel said,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.020
Cluster name for this fan as taxed green.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.100
So now if we look in our title,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.970
we can see now the middle ward is green.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.650
Okay,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.220
good.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.110
Now the next thing we have is history Rapper.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.020
Now let's open the history component And inside this history component,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.410
we see that we have faced rapper and history classes.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.220
It means that we need to create a rapper element for the history component,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.650
So Deve level productive as a rapper element and we will put it at the end to close it and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.460
now we will apply our styles.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.380
So first we have history rapper class.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.940
Then we have the Class four DUl itself.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.120
It is going to be just history and let's inspect what we have inside.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.600
Inside,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.600
we have alli elements without any class and then button move class with the dynamic active

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.720
class over here.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.070
Let's replace this in line styles while we're here and let's put class name and how can we

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.720
apply dynamic styles?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.480
We have been on Lee using in line styles to apply something dynamic.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.080
What about just classes?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.890
And you see classes here are just strings,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.720
and it means that they can be managed with string interpolation.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.820
So using string interpolation,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.070
we can apply dynamic styles that I make classes based on some conditions.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.030
So let's open Carly brackets and let's put back ticks.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.930
And inside this back ticks,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.120
we will first define our static button move class so we will put but and move over here and

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.920
then we will open string contar population and we will put conditions.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.700
So if current element is the current move,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.880
then we will return the active class.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.870
Otherwise,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.500
we will return the empty string to just remove the class completely and let's remove this

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.960
empty space at the end and let's see if it actually work.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.400
Now let's play the game and let's inspect our elements.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.810
So our final element has the active class.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.960
And when I traveled the history,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.520
this class disappears.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.940
So it is being applied dynamically and that's it about dynamic classes.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.570
Now let's move on and let's see,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.700
What do we have next in route dot s CSS.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.970
Next we have a status message.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.260
So let's close history and let's open status message.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.020
And here we will do a slight difference to our structure.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.300
So first we will replace this H to attack with a Deve.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.410
And for this day,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.050
if we apply this class name that we have here starters message,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.470
So class name,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.600
status,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.800
message,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.580
then what we will do.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.040
Since we have our X and zero with different colors,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.150
we need to rob them in some elements to apply classes.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.810
So what we will do here for this conditional render instead of just return in string,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.150
we will return react fragment.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.570
So let's put react fragment over here and I will explain why exactly?

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:36.680
React fragment and we will put Winner is Denver will open a span element,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.600
enviable Porta Wheeler Insight.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.280
And for this span,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.210
we will use class name off,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.670
text green or not.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.230
Actually,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.750
we will apply dynamic class here.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.820
So if our winner is going to be equal to X,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.380
then we will apply text green.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.750
Otherwise we will apply text orange.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.270
And when we have only one class that we want to assign dynamically,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.250
we can avoid using back ticks,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.640
opens Lincoln tribulation and directly put logic here.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.880
And since we returned the string it will be assigned to class name.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.980
Now let's check it out.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.990
And if we played the game and when we have a winner,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.100
we can say that our winner is X with the green color.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.620
If it was zero,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.160
then we would have this orange color over here.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.210
Perfect.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.030
And using the same logic,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.400
we will adjust our other conditions.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.160
Now what about this empty brackets?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.090
What about react fragments over here?

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.610
If I remove it here,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.000
I will get an error because due to the first rule of a component,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.710
it must always return single element and the same applies two conditions.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.100
So we simply needed to wrap it in element like that.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.240
So it becomes like a single element.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.220
But we don't need it in this case.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.120
So that's why we put react fragment over here.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.460
Now let's adjust this logic.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:15.690
So let's copy all of that from here and we will put next player is and let's wrap it in a

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.480
react fragment like that and also at the end,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.790
we will close it and we will put next player is Then we will wrap everything in a span

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:35.000
element and we will close it at the end and also we don't need.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.690
There's a dollar sign here and now we need to apply the dynamic class as well.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.960
So we will put class name and then we are going to ask,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.460
so the logic will be almost the same.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.740
We will only change winner two.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.620
If current is next,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.790
then we will render the green color.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.990
Otherwise it is going to be orange.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.160
Let's check it out.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.370
And when we have X,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.220
it is green.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.800
When we have zero,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.390
it is orange perfect.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.850
So everything work now about the last condition.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.040
So let's replace it completely.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:24.310
Let's put react fragment and we will poured spell first to say that it is eggs.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:31.650
And then we will put another span to place our zero and then the message.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.950
And now we will simply apply dynamic classes.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.180
No dynamic classes,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.800
but study classes for X.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:48.960
We have green class and 40 We have orange class text orange or rich like that.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.970
Okay,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:50.610
Perfect.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.740
So it seems like here we are finished.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.320
Now let's move on.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:03.120
Then we have reset button and this is this button inside Abdel Gs start new game.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.550
So let's define class name and let's open curly brackets than back ticks.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.540
And inside this back ticks,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.800
we will put button reset.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.490
And for dynamic class,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.540
it becomes active only when we have a winner.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.850
So we will open string in preparation and level check.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.170
If we have a winner,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.000
then we will set the active class.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.730
Otherwise,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.050
it is going to be empty.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:29.920
All right.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.850
And let's check it out if we have a winner.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.420
So yeah,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:36.990
perfect.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.480
Now it becomes active quote.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.960
Then we have the board class.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.790
So let's get back to you.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.650
Our board and we already have classes different here.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.320
All right,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.800
so we slightly changed border collar and the dynamic winning square class.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.860
So let's get back to Square doggy s and here again instead,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.110
off using this dynamic in line styles,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.200
we will put the winning dynamic class with animation.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.830
So let's check it out.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:19.300
So we're gonna put class name than open back ticks and inside backed ICS What we will do,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.330
we will ask if our square is winning square.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.560
Then we will apply this winning class so we will apply winning.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.860
Otherwise it is going to be an empty shrink.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.280
Let's remove that.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.950
And we have another here saying that no duplicate props alone.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.310
Well,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.050
we already have the class here,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.610
so let's put it at the beginning and remove that one.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.770
And also we need to display either grin were orange color.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:56.530
So let's put another shrinking trip Elation right after that one and we will ask if our

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:02.420
value as X then we are going to return text green.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.420
Otherwise,

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.550
we are going to return text orange if I save it.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.930
And if I go back to my app now,

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.360
if I played the game,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.540
you can see that whenever we have X,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.570
it is green and whenever we have zero,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.550
it is orange,

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.730
so it works perfectly.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.860
Now let's move on.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.500
And then we have our almost final piece.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.460
I would say this BG bowls and what are those?

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:37.770
Let's actually go to Abdel Gs and at the very aunt will put an empty self closing Deve.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.400
And let's apply only this plus name off beachy vaults.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.650
And when we see what we can see this both at the bottom and at the top that are responsive

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.830
and looks nice.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.830
And our final step here would be to add,

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.720
Let's say,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:04.200
this H two over here with the current game history and we will apply dynamic style over

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.770
here.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.740
Front weight equals,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.430
let's say normal and yeah,

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.180
we are done.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.230
Just look at this beauty Now.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.190
We finished the game completely.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.080
It has styled.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.410
It is responsive,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.010
and it just looks nice and playable.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.950
Congrats to everyone.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.360
In the next video,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.000
we will start the deployment part available,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.740
deployed to a service called search dot shh.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.360
But before we finish this video,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.120
let's commit our changes.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:46.240
So I'm gonna get at everything and then get commit to say about the message.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.550
So it is going to be styled the entire,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.550
uh,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.890
all right,

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.630
congrats,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.350
everyone.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.780
See you in the next one
