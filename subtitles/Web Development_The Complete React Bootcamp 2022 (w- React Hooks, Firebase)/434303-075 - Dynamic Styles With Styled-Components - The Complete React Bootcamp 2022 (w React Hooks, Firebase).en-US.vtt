00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey there.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.650
In this video we will continue working with custom hooks and now we are going to use Hook

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.460
that we created in the previous video which is used persistent reducer and rapper that we

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.960
created use shows.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.350
Let's go So let's first find the place where we will use it.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.750
It is going to be our show great component,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.100
the place where we're under show cards which are these ones.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.990
And here the first thing we will do we will import our who because it is a wrapper around

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.880
use reducer.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.160
It will have the same structure.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.960
So it is going to be state and dispatch but instead of state will rename it to,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.350
let's say start shows and these punch let it be just dispatch start and then we will call

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:06.090
our use shows And also we need to import eso import use shows from MISC custom cooks.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630
All right now when I save it,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.800
if I go back to my app and whenever cards are being rendered,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.570
I will see that inside local storage I will have key shows and value empty rate because of

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450
the state is initialized.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.140
So it works now what I need studio.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.560
First,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.350
people write this dot map function a little bit.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.080
So instead of returning one single element,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.790
we will define body and be able to turn it like that.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.250
And here we will put the next logic.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.620
First,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.040
we will define if the show that we currently render is inside our state.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.170
So what we can do?

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.730
We will define you Arable,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.770
which will say is starred,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.680
and we will simply ask if start shows includes show dot i d.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.210
All right now,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.200
what will be our strategy to put functionality to this button?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.070
Let's open show card inside.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.280
Well,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.250
confined this button over here,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.370
so we need to pour on click handler tube to manage that.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.660
So let's put on Click and for this on click,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.630
what do we do?

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.480
We will define this handler next to this is start valuable,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.000
and then we will pass it as a prop to show card and put it as on click handler.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.850
So let's name it on star click,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.490
and then we will receive it as a prop.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.130
And now we need to define on star click over here.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.350
So let's create it for now.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.940
Let it be an empty function,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.520
and then we put it here.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.330
All right.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.960
Now,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.050
what should we?

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.160
Poor insight this handler.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.640
Well,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.590
when we click on the show,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.920
when we click on the button,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.680
if it is already in the state,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.260
then we need to to remove it If it's not in the state,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.370
and then we will edit.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.570
So we already have.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.040
This is started bowling.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.980
That indicated.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.310
So we will ask if our show is already start.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.650
Then we're going to dispatch,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.360
Start with the type off.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.310
Remove exactly the same type that we specified here inside our shows.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.010
Reducer.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.950
So we also need to pass showed that idea next to it.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.050
So it is going to be show dot i d.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.060
And otherwise,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.250
If our show is not started,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.650
then we will dispatch start with the type off,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.590
add and then again show I d is going to be show not I d.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.360
All right?

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.620
It seems fine.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.280
Now let's check it out.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.960
If I click on show,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.180
I can see that these being added to the array And if I click it one more time,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.200
it is removed.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.990
If I add another show and then another show and then removed them.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.060
It actually works,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.040
but the user is not notified because this is just the button without any styles.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.930
What do we do?

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.600
Well,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.630
the first thing people do it will replace these taxed with star component that we created

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.860
in previous videos.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.630
And the start component comes from styled,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.820
and it is our style component.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.320
All right,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.890
so now if I save it,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.000
if I look for any show,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.190
I can see that all of them become yellow.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.700
But this is not what we want.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.830
We wanted them to be yellow on Lee when the your editor to the state how we are able to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.430
manage it.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.530
So we need to pass custom props to the star component to notify it.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.370
But if you look inside our component,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.320
it looks like that well,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.110
how can we use custom props with that well inside style components,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.300
So we use back ticks for the reason we use it for string interpolation.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.750
So instead of this background color said to yellow,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.030
let's first copy this line,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.330
and then what we will do will open string interpolation,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.560
and here we need to provide a callback function which receives some props or arguments.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.370
Let's just consul.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.250
Log them for now and let's see what we will receive.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.780
So if I inspect and go to Consul when I render buttons,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.000
you will see that I will have nine or 10 council locks,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.490
the number off cards and insight.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.860
I have only one prop,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.450
which is theme.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.640
But if I pass anything to this star component,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.770
let's say I don't know what say active.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.060
And if I save it now,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.550
if I render it,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.440
I can see that active is set to true.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.610
So whatever I pass whatever props I passed you custom styled component.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.940
I will get it here as it props.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.780
And whatever we return from this string interpolation will be inserted into this place so

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.630
we can use it.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.160
So instead of this,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.950
I will put if props dot active.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.840
Then I'm gonna run there the yellow color.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.450
Otherwise,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.000
I'm gonna put let's say great color,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.390
which is a d d d.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.070
And that's it.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.300
Now we define our functionality.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.560
But here I see an error.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.590
I need to put this bracket and it will work.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.630
All right now,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:44.790
the only thing we need to do here we need to also pass is a start to show cart to be able

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.440
to pass it down to the star component.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.690
So what we will do right after on star collectible poor is starred and little past is start

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.690
.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.250
So now inside show card.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.150
We can access it over here,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:06.410
and we can pass it as the active proper Judy start component.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.490
All right,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.760
let's check it out.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.100
If I look for any show,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.850
I can see that all of them are great.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.540
But when I click on a show,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.670
you can see it becomes yellow and it is being added to the state.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.650
So it actually worked.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.460
And if I remove it now,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.760
I have the great color.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.400
All right,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.720
so it works just perfect.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.850
And as we wanted.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.950
Okay,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.410
Good.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.600
Now the only thing with these is that if we go to the show page,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.550
this star that we render over here is great.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.540
And this is inside show main data.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.550
And here this is the place where we're under the start.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.400
To make it always yellow,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.580
we can simply pass active with set to true.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.270
So it always yell.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.070
And now we are done with this.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.790
Okay.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.980
In the next video,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.950
what we will do.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:07.480
We will actually display all start shows inside the page and we will get them from the

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.450
local storage.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.360
But for this video,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.140
it is over.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.830
Let's commit our changes.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.930
We're gonna put get at everything and then get commit.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.660
And let's say,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:24.090
using custom hooks four starred shows.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.100
All right,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.650
see you in the next one.
