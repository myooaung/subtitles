00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
hello in these two videos we're going to handle likes in our application.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.070
In this video,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.470
we will create a component that is going to be a wrapper around control.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.190
I come that we will add to the message item.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.970
Let's go,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.510
Let's get back to the code and let's first define how we're going to use this component.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.230
So let's open message I,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.680
Tim,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.320
and we will place it right after a time ago.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.030
So here will have a component,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.940
something like I can VT and control.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.070
And then this component Well,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.550
except in next props.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.550
So first we're gonna define whether it is going to be visible or not.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.040
For now,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.530
let it be visible.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.910
Then we will put I can name and for now,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.210
let it be hard for our likes.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.360
Then also,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.910
we will have tool tip that will say something like like this message.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.490
Also,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.560
it will have a handler on click handler.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.350
So for now,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.780
let it be an empty function and also it will have a two conditional props.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.130
So first is going to be color and then it is going to be bench content.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.080
Eventually it will have to Aikens close Aiken and,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.210
like I confer like I can we want to display tilted with content.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.710
So that's why we're gonna put batch content as an additional problem.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.230
And for now,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.800
let's say that will have five likes something like this.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.420
All right.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.680
Now let's actually create this component and let's see how it will look like so here Under

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.230
messages,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.510
Let's create Aiken,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.010
VT.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.850
And Control.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.980
And let's define how it will look like before we do any markup.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.030
Let's first grab the props so we have is visible.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.450
Then we also have I can name.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.150
We have tool tip we have on Click,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.300
and we have badge content way.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.140
Other props we will store under props.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.740
Object.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.010
Okay,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.190
so it is going to be a diff with class Name of margin left to let's say style is going to

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.050
be the next.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.290
So we're gonna put visibility prop,

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.380
and it is going to be visible on Lee when is visible,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.290
set to true.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.950
So if is visible,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.250
then visible,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.550
otherwise hidden.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.180
Okay,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.680
good inside this def.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.990
We need to pour.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.150
Let's say a conditional batch content a conditional component,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.030
and here's a little trick.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.250
How you can do that.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.840
It is not really a really primitive or obvious.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.880
Let's say approach.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.450
How to create a conditional render off component inside a component.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.910
So it is the trick.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.540
First we poured here,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.400
and you component,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.750
let's say conditional badge like this,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.340
it will receive one property,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.260
which is going to be,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.720
let's say,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.010
condition where a value that we wanted to display.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.060
Then here we're gonna pour conditional badge and as a prop,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.180
we're going to pass condition and this condition is going to be our badge content.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.750
And here we're gonna ask if we have a condition,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.270
then we're going to war batch with content off condition,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.400
which is going to be our actual value.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.710
And then we're gonna rapper in Children like that.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.300
Otherwise we will just return Children.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.130
So,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.520
yeah,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.630
this is the trick.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.460
And we need to grab Children from our props as well.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.190
So it will look something like this,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.350
but I can see that something is wrong.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.780
So what is happening here away?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.570
I forgot the bracket.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.050
All right,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.180
so this is it.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.570
Now,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.070
if we have much content,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.220
this conditional batch will be rendered otherwise,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.060
we have Children,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.870
which is all the content that we pass inside.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.290
OK,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.790
but inside we're gonna pass away.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.150
Spur and whisper is the component from our suit that they used for something like tool tip

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.150
.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.420
So for a whisper,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.440
we're gonna pass.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.840
Let's a placement chop.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.050
Then we're gonna pass DeLay.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.240
It also has a delay of zero than dilly.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.600
Hide also is going to be Zito.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.980
DeLay show is going to be also zero trigger is going to be holler and speaker.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.500
We're gonna pass tool tip and for tool tip message.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.570
We're gonna pass guilty property like this inside this whisper or for a trigger,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.600
we're gonna display icon button normal component from our suit.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.790
And for it least Aiken,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.200
button,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.620
we gonna pour all the crops first that we received over here,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.550
And then we will have on click handler and we're gonna pass on click that we receive.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.560
Then we're gonna put it as a circle size is going to be very small.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.330
And also I can itself is going to be I can let's imported.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.310
And for ICANN,

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.420
we're gonna put icon.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.710
I can name that we also receive as a property.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.940
Now it seems ready Inside message item.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.470
We can see that I convenient is not defined.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.920
Let's imported and let's actually see how it looks like.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.630
So now if we open our application now,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.550
we have likes.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.020
However,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.760
we don't have color.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.180
So what I proposed to do here,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.830
we're going to pour a conditional collar.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.400
So how wearable to do that?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.480
We already did that.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.540
So we can pour something like this.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.160
We can spread our object If our condition is true or we can spread an empty object.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.100
In this case,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.480
we will not pass any property.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.360
So we're gonna put something like if our condition is true,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.750
then we will pour the color off red.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.290
And otherwise,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.360
we're gonna put an empty object so it will work,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.890
and it will do its think.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.190
Now,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.140
if I had a fresh you can see I have red color when condition is true.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.990
Otherwise I have false.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.550
Okay,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.790
good.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.570
So it works.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.540
And by the way,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.690
if you're wondering where it will go,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.380
it will go here for these props.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.350
And these props will be passed to Aiken button.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.260
So basically,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.790
we said color for this Aiken button.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.100
Okay,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.350
So this is it for this video in the next video,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.740
we will display the likes and mobile at functionality.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.770
But as for now,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.650
let's finish this video by committing our changes.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.980
Leads at everything to the stage state and then get commit.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.890
Creator,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.940
I can VT in control component like this.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.460
Okay,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.830
Perfect.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.080
See you in the next one.
