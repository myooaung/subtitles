00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
Hey there.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.070
In the previous video,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.840
when we created sent FC M Cloud function,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.490
I did a few spelling errors that I want to fix in this video.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.750
The first error underlies in room data.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.080
We want to get on data from room snapshot dot value,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.400
so let's fix it.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.250
Teoh room snapshot dot value,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.880
then second error is inside half cm users.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.920
We want to transform our data from DAR FC M users instead of FC M user.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.050
Then if we scroll down to FC a message object here.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110
We used registration tokens,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.490
and this error comes from copy pacing from firebase documentation.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.430
So let's remove it and let's put tokens and the same mobile do inside fail tokens Don't

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.670
push because we want to make sure that we get tokens from our tokens,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.160
a rape.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.870
Then if we scroll down the very last ever will be.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.870
You have to be signed in and that's it.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.460
Everything else looks good.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.140
Now.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.810
Let's save the file and commit our changes.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.720
Let's forget everything,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.370
then get commit and let's say fix spelling errors.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.800
Perfect CEO in the next one
