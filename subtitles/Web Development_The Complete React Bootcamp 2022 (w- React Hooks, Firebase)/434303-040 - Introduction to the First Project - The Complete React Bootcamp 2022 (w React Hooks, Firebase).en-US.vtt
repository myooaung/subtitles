00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
Hello.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.940
Welcome to the first project section.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.840
Right now I'm gonna show you what we will have built by the end of this section.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.890
So this is going to be a tic tac toe game that you can see right now where we can play at

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.520
makes him moves by either X or zero.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.620
And when we have a winner,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.700
we have this cool animation saying Who has won?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.740
And also we have current game history which weaken Travers and mortify on the fly.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.070
It might look simple,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.460
but it has a lot of basics and that will build a really strong foundation for the future

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.530
react projects.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.450
So by the end of this section,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.050
you will be able to create a simple react Project yourself and you will get to know react

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.190
main principles.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.440
In the next video,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.710
we'll start in.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500
Rubles can fold in your project.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.630
See you there.
