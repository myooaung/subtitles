00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
Hello.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.220
Welcome to the new section.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.660
Right now I'm going to demonstrate to what kind of project will build.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.820
This is going to be an app that we named as box office,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.060
and it will display all data about different TV movies and shows on also about TV actress.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.140
So on the home page we have a few buttons here and this surge a bar.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.850
And if we look for some,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.970
show something with the man and click on Sorge or press the enter button.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.180
Then we will get our results that we receive from an A p I that we will to use.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.250
And here we have a different cards.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.210
So on the card we have two buttons read more and the start button.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.230
So if we click on the start button and then if we navigate to another page,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.010
which is start shows,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.440
what will?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.850
Yet this start movies will be here that we can also remove from here or at from here.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.690
Then we have read more button on the card,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980
and if we click on that button will navigated you.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.850
The official show page,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.860
Let's say here would display all data regarding additional details,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.780
seasons and cast.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.680
And if we go back to our main app and if we navigate back to home,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.850
we can see that our soul Jabbar is still there.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.150
That's because we persist data.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.950
Even if I had a fresh in the page,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.250
the search bar will still be there.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.440
And the same applies to the start shows.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.680
Whenever I refresh,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.500
it is always there.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.710
And also we have this actors radio button.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.110
And if we click on it and leave research for some actors,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.850
we can see basic information about different actors.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.880
But we don't have any page that we use for this actor.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.990
So these are just cards and this is it.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.080
I guess it is going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.530
And before we start,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.050
please don't forget to You don't load the assets folder.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.550
See you in the next one
