00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Hello.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.020
In this video,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.470
we're going to talk about Hughes Reducer and other hook available for us for state

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.320
banishment With EU state,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.990
we are able to manage simple state,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.010
and it is great.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.030
But when it comes to something more complex,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.660
like objects nested with two levels inside,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.290
or if we have a few states that can be eventually grouped together,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.790
then use state is not the best option for these use cases We have used reducer,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.560
and it is completely different approach for state management.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.420
Let's take a look at this reducer concept and our main keywords Here are action,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.750
this patch and reducer.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.640
Let's imagine we have an array off names as a state Alice,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.720
Bob and Trudy for the state.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.120
We define a set of actions first,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.490
something like add to array removed from array and modify the array.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.870
Then we will create a reducer for the set of actions we defined.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.940
Reducer is a function that will protest actions and update the state.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.860
This is the place where we poured update logic.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.060
When reducer and actions are defined from our code,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.430
we will call the dispatch function along with the action type and data we need to protest

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.100
the update.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.130
Operation Dispatch will omit this action,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.800
and the reducer that we defined will intercept it and then process it right after that,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.650
the state will be updated.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.850
Let's say we want to remove Bob from the array from our code.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.850
We will call dispatch with action type and elements name that we are about to remove.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.730
Then this action will be protest by the reducer and reducer.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.350
Once it's done will update the state.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.020
This approach of state management is more versatile and preferable when it comes to more

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.830
complex state structures.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.780
And if you ever heard of reduction library for state management,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.620
it uses exactly the same approach with reducers.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.200
So this is it.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.850
See you in the next one.
