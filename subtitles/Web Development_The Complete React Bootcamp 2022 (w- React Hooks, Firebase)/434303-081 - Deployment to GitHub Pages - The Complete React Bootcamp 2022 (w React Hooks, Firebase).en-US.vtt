00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey there,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.520
Right now,

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.250
we're going to deploy our application to get help using get hop pages.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.910
Let's go First,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.570
we are going to open official Crete,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.280
React up documentation,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.350
and from here we will navigate through the deployment part.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.950
Let's scroll down until we find get hop pages.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.920
So these part is right over here.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.980
Let's just follow these steps.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.630
So first we need Teoh at just package the Jason and add home page Keep.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.620
So let's copy it from here.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.280
And then let's not engaged to package Jason.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.070
And right at the top,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.070
we will add home page.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.450
So instead of my user name,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.730
we will pour our user name that we have on get up.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.420
So I'm gonna put mine.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.350
And for my app,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.260
we need to pour our repository name.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.760
So if we are going to look at our repository,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.550
it is just box office.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.260
So let's specify box office.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.080
All right,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.950
let's save it.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.620
And now let's take a look.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.050
What do we have next?

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.740
Next?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.030
We have installed get help pages and add deploy script.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.120
So let's first in style get help pages.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.110
So inside my terminal,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.390
I'm gonna execute this command that I copied.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.270
Now let's wait until it is installed and then adjust the package.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.150
Decent file.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.060
All right,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.640
get help.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.290
Pages are here.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.140
Now let's take a look and let's see how we need to modify our script section.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.020
So we need to add pre deploy and deploy script.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.650
Let's copy them from here and them right after clear comment.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.700
At the very end,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.280
we will add pre deploy and to deploy.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.530
So let's remove these pluses and let's save it.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.740
All right now it says that our final step is to deploy our site.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.450
So let's run and PM run deploy script that we defined.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.720
So npm Run,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.500
deploy.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.880
And now let's wait until it is deployed.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.560
All right.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.520
At the very end,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.980
I can see that it is published.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.500
So now let's navigate to our repository and let's refresh the page.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.350
Now we will see that we have two branches.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.410
Let's click.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.050
Advil will see that we have also get hop pages brunch.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.670
All right,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.280
now let's navigate to settings And here if we scroll down to the very end,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.630
we can see get help pages part and we can see that our website is published at this.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.550
Your l let's click it and it says that our website is not found,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.670
but we have the your l.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.070
And this is our not found drought.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.250
So what happened?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.300
And this is something related Teoh server configuration and because we used single page

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.140
application.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.450
So you prevent this inside our code.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.080
What we need to do inside index dot gs here,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.950
instead of browser router,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.650
we need to use another type of router,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.740
which is going to be hash router that also is imported from react rotor dumb.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.100
And what will they do?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.920
It will configure our application for clients side routing only exactly what we have.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.960
So now what we need to do.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.890
We need to just run NPM run,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.050
deploy command one more time.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.920
So let's execute it.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.940
And let's wait until our changes are published.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.700
All right,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.260
Seems like updates are online.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.040
Let's take a look right now.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.020
And if I refresh the page,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.180
nothing happens.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.550
But let's just close this your l and then navigate back Teoh our water repository.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.570
So I'm gonna open my repose than box office.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.760
And then if we go back to settings,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.370
find our Ural From now on,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.050
if we click on it again.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.990
Nothing happens.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.490
But if we refresh the page,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.650
we can see that these hash has been appended to the Europe.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.190
And if we switch pages,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.010
the hash will still be there.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.790
So everything will work.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.510
And even if we refresh the page,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.340
our application works.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.750
Fine.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.600
But the only thing now that we have this hash inside the Ural But that's not a big deal,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.170
is it?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.840
So that's it.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.650
And now our application is online.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.310
We can share it and show it to our friends.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.150
All right,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.930
let's also don't forget to commit our changes and then deploy them to get help.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.190
Rep.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.430
Oh,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.320
so what we're going to do,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.660
we're gonna put good at everything.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.060
Then we're gonna type,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.510
get commit and let's say,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:03.470
deployed the app and used and start using hash rotor.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.070
All right,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.980
seems good.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:13.580
Let's also type get push origin master to ensure that the latest changes are online.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.060
And that's it.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.830
We are totally finished.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.610
Congrats to everyone in the next videos.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.580
We're going to talk about optimization to make our application even more Fuster.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.450
See you that
