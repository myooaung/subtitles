00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
Hey,

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.610
In this video,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.760
we will create Lee our for the home page.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.750
So for now,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.950
we already built the left part,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.990
which a sidebar?

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.570
Right now we're gonna define our right part,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.430
and we're going to see how they gonna play a responsive let's go.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.130
So let's open home togs file.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.710
And here we will have a nest,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.350
a drought.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.950
So when we click on a chat room,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.190
we can see that we go to chat slash room i d.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.860
For that,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.510
we need to create an acidly out because we're gonna show it on the home page.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.920
So what I proposed to dio here instead of just using one file directly,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.260
let's create to not the folder home.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.620
And here we're gonna put all Nestor droughts and home DGS is going to be inside index togs

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.620
.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.620
So let's create new folder home inside we're gonna put home than we're gonna rename it to

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.970
index dot gs.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.970
And here our nest the drought is going to be chat page.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.310
So let's create new file that we're gonna name Chat Doggy s.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.680
And for now,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.170
it is going to be empty.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.030
Solicitous port.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.580
Hello?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.120
All right,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.180
so inside this index If we save it,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.960
let's refresh Cannot open directory.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.560
All right,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.980
maybe let's restart the app and it will work.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.160
Let me refresh.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.780
All right,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.030
now it seems fine.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.490
Good.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.540
Let's continue.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.610
So our first step is going to be defined.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.940
Ah,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.420
where?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.310
Nestor Drought.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.390
So here,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.500
next to this column,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:40.590
let's define switch statement and here we're gonna pour the chat route and the sidebar It

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.630
will be persisted because it is our layout.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.840
So inside this,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.510
which let's pour out and because our home page is already private,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.560
we don't need to pour nest droughts.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.970
Also private routes.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.150
We can use them as public because our parents is private.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.080
It means that those are already protected.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.300
So it is going to be exact route and path is going to be slash chad slash chat I d to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.480
follow the grid.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.990
We need to also put a column over here.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.290
So let's put column and inside we're gonna pour chat and let's also imported from this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.860
folder.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.990
So let me specify chat and we're gonna use chat.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.390
All right,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.340
now it looks good.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.080
Let's define how Maney columns the chat page will take.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.780
So on small devices,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.410
it will take all 24 columns and on medium devices.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.080
We're gonna take the rest off this so it is going to be 16 and then class Name is also

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.380
going to be a church 100.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.270
Now let's take a look and let's see.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.790
All right,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.930
do we have Hello,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.780
Let's inspect and let's try and rece ice.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.550
All right,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.850
so we see that when we are on small devices,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.780
we have this,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.290
let's say,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.280
from top to bottom,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.680
Lee out.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.750
That's not what we want.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.650
We want to hide this hello on small devices and because we need to not only hide this,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.140
we also want to make sure that whenever we go to chat room,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.830
we don't see the navigation bar.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.550
The sidebar.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.890
So that's why we need to put some sort of ah,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.880
let's say complicated condition.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.730
So first of all,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.090
we need to define our break point when we are on desktop,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.550
and this is when we have 992 pixels.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.100
So first let's define is desktop,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.220
and it is going to be the result off use media query hook that we defined earlier.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.620
And here we're gonna ask if men with IHS 992 pixels,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.140
right?

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.980
So in this case,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.010
we will have desktop.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.520
Also,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.920
we need to take our second condition when we are exactly on the home page so we can show

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.580
sidebar on small devices,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.350
not the chat page,

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.120
so it will become hidden.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.800
So let's define is exact like this.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.520
Let's destructor it from use,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.040
not use.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.350
Media Query used route much.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.170
It is another hook that comes from react router,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.910
the same as use location.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.070
But this cook gives us,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.810
let's say,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.740
thinks related to our current route and drought match.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.200
So one of these props is is exact and it will tell if we are currently on this defined

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.820
route,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.080
which is home page.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.480
So whenever when we will be on just slash it will give us is exactly equal to truth.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.140
All right,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.320
so now let's define our condition.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.730
So let's poor can render sidebar and we gonna ask if it is desktop for if it is exact

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.840
passed on Lee,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.720
then we will be able to render sidebar.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.470
So now here,

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.650
let's pour the next logic.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.170
So if we can render sidebar,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.610
then we're gonna put this column and now here we need to also define,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.230
Let's say,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.720
a four a four hour or if someone opens a broken chat page,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.090
we can live it empty and it will be fine.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.450
But let's make it fancy and let's pull out over here and here.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.650
We're gonna ask if is desktop only.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.440
Then we want to show column,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.980
and it will have,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.500
I guess,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.740
the same lee out as here.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.150
So let's just copy it.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.180
And inside,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.940
we're gonna pull it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:40.790
Let's say just text that will say Please select chat and class name is going to be taxed

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.170
center and margin top Fage rights.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.830
Now let's take a look.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.470
So whenever now we are on slash chats less room I d.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.380
We can see only chatter on page.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.580
If I remove this and navigate to home page,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.700
I can see only sidebar,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.940
so it looks good.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.450
If I resize it,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.810
I can see both of them so I can see my chat room,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.120
but instead off the actual chat.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.680
Whenever it's not selected,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.250
I can see police select shot at full back for out,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.470
so it works like 404 and if I select one of the chats,

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.150
I can see the actual chat window.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.100
I guess this is it for this video.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.710
Next time we will continue.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.500
But for now,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.330
let's just commit our changes.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.920
Let's put,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.350
Get at everything.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:39.830
Get commit and let's say created we our for home page and created Shat page for right.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.490
Awesome.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.860
See you in the next one.
