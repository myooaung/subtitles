00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
Hey,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.530
in this video,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.550
we're going to display the uploaded avatar image inside our dashboard.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.420
Let's go.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.850
First,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.270
I want to show the component from our suit,

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.480
which is Allah tar.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930
So I navigated to its documentation,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.650
and I opened Alit are under data display.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.060
So here the cool thing about this component that it can actually show name initials if we

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.070
don't have any image.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550
So let's open an example.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.080
And let's see how we can actually put name initials if we don't have any source file.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.350
So we need to simply pass this initials to Avatar Component.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.930
So what I proposed to do,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.290
I proposed to create a wrapper around this component.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.560
So whenever we don't have an image rebel display name initials.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.240
So under components,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.430
let's create new file,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.490
which we will name profile Avatar.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.540
So let it be a component that returns this Ah,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.490
what are component that comes from our suit like this?

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.450
So what props should we specify for these Avatar?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.550
So we're gonna need the name off user,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.740
so we're gonna pass it as props.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.170
So let's destructor name and whatever goes to these component,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
it will be redirected to the avatar component from our series.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.210
So let's put it,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270
Teoh Avatar props.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.060
And then let's spread it all over the element.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.850
All right,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.260
Good.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.840
Now,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.100
inside this avatar,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.240
we need to port name initials.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.340
But let's say our name is something like Andrew,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.320
and something goes afterwards.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.050
So how we can get the actual name initials we will create a helper function.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.550
So let's delete this.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.190
And under MISC,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.100
let's create new file that we will call helpers doggy s and hittable define all our

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.510
reasonable functions that will help us during the code.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.430
So we're going to create a new function that we will name,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's say,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.480
get name initials.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.690
It will receive user name as an argument,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.320
and our logic will be the next.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.830
First,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.770
we're gonna split it into array off awards,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.370
and then we're going to check if we have two or more words in our nickname,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.440
Then we will get first letters off first to wards.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.930
So let's first get the actual area.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.400
We're gonna name it,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.850
Let's say split name.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.980
Then we're gonna do name dot to opera.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.540
Case will converted to uppercase in advance,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
and then we're gonna split it by empty spaces.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.970
So in this way,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.840
we will end up with an array off words.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.340
And then we're gonna check if split name array doc length is greater than one.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.500
So if we have two awards,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.600
at least then we gonna return Split name,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.030
First word.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.640
And then from first word,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.050
we need to get the first letter.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.960
So we're gonna open second brackets,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.340
and we're gonna put first element.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.150
Then we're gonna put plus sign to come cut in a district.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.990
Then we're gonna put against Bleidt name this time Hubble reference.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.050
The second element.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.390
The second word.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.700
So we're gonna put one and again,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.570
we're gonna reference the first letter.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.920
We put zero.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.440
All right,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.190
In case if we have only one word by default,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.060
we gonna return.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.270
Just split name zero,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.850
which is First Word.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.500
And then first element first letter.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.050
All right.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.880
And let's also explored this function from here.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.160
Now,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.290
inside our profile avatar here inside curly brackets,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.550
we can actually call,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.960
get name and it shows,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.330
and we can pass name that we receive from props.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.100
All right,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.740
now,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.580
let's go to Avatar.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.510
Applaud Bt and component.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.330
And here,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.050
let's use this component.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.120
So we're gonna put profile Allah car as source.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.120
We're going to specify profile dot avatar and then for name.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.840
We're going to specify profile dot name.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.270
So in this way,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.130
when we have a source file,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.420
then the source file will be displayed.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.540
If we don't have it,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.800
our name initials will be there.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.440
All right,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.430
let's save it and let's take a look.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.450
What's do we have?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.940
Let's navigate back to our dashboard And right now I can see that I don't have any avatar

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.510
image.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.210
All right,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.750
maybe a Let's upload one.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.590
Let's open it.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.110
Let's upload New Avatar Avatar has been uploaded,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.820
and still I can see any data.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.440
All right,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.590
so that's because actually,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.650
we didn't modify our contacts.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.180
Our profile contacts.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.710
Let's go to profile context and data that we pass over here doesn't have any Ah,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.800
what are but inside Al Atar Applaud BT in US source.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.180
I specified profile Avatar.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.610
This profile comes from use profile context.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.440
So what do we need to do now that we re data from database?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.470
We can actually just destructor it from here from our snapshot,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.850
right?

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.150
As simple as that.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.440
So then we also will pass it to our contacts All right,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.270
let's save it.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.720
And now let's take a look.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.160
If I go to my dashboard now I have this image.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.830
But first of all,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.290
it looks really weird,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.300
So let's modify it a little bit.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.550
Let's go to profile Avatar and by default,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.750
right before we spread all off the props.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.390
Let's put circle so it will be circled by default.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.650
Let's check it out.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.590
Now it is circled,

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.750
but the size is really,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.670
really small.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.260
So what,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.390
we can dio inside avatar upload button?

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.050
We can apply class names and that will fix it.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.860
We know that our image,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.240
our converse that we specified for our tar editor is 200 by 200.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.430
So we're gonna apply with 200 height 200 pixels,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.430
those classes that you confined inside utility classes.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.450
So let's save it.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.980
And if we go to dashboard now,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.490
we have the correct size for M A dropper.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.840
But the image itself is really small,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.190
so we need to recites the actual image.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.770
For this.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.440
I created this plus name that you can also find inside utilities,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.470
which is image full size,

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.770
and it will give with an height 100% to the image.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.060
So now it looks good.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.820
However,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.250
there is one small little problem.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.050
If I delayed this image,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.300
let's deliver it from here now.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.000
As you can see,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.370
if we don't have any image,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.160
I get name initials,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.220
but they're too small as well,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.710
so we need to also adjust phone size.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.650
So for this,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.300
let's put front huge size and everything will be fine.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.730
Let's check it out.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.190
Now.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.370
I have the correct size for my text as well.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.090
So now maybe let's change the nickname and put two words.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.690
Let's put and to be.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.810
And let's check if we have two letters as our initials and in Did we have a displayed here

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.810
?

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.440
Nice.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.750
Let's try and applaud New Allah car.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.040
Let's select it.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.560
And Avatar has been uploaded,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.150
looks nice and works seamlessly.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.510
Okay,

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.940
good.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.270
I guess that's the good time to finish this video.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.500
So let's commit our changes with message.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.180
Something like displayed have a tar user avatar.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.210
Okay,

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.950
Perfect.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.260
See you in the next one.
