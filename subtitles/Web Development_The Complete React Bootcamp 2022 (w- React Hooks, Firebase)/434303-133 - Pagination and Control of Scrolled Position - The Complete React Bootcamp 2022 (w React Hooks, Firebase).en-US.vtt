00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.390
Hello.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.250
In this video we will handle pagination inside the chat.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.930
Right now we load all messages from the database and this is not really good.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.110
So in this video,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.680
we will figures that and also we will fix this problem.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.080
When we refresh the page or switch between chats,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.320
we are not scroll to the bottom.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.950
Let's go.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.760
So the question is how you're able to handle pagination in firebase?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.940
Well,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.000
there are a few approaches and the most common one is just you re subscribe Teoh new chat

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.190
messages Every time we load a new portion,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.880
This is the approach that we take.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.450
We can take another approach Teoh lower only old messages on the initial Lord and then

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.450
subscribe to new updates.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.190
However,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.340
this approach will not work because if we load old messages on Lee once and we update one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.270
of the messages,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.030
it will not be updated in real time.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.720
So this is not our case.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.050
We want to update all messages and they all must be real time.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.350
That's why we're gonna use the first approach.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.850
So lets navigate to index dot gs inside messages and here at the top,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.670
we're first going to specify our size for the page.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.280
Let it be page size off 15.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.380
Now we need to create stayed inside our component that represents our current limit.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.100
So let's create limit and set limit.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.310
And by default,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.260
this state will be equal to page size.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.920
Okay,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.340
good.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.530
Now let's look inside.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.890
Use the fact where we fetch our messages.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.650
So we have this message,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.080
ref,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.510
that is not bounded to this use of fact or days component because it doesn't use any

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.620
internal values,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.850
so we can safely move it here to the top.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.410
All right,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.850
Good.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.970
Now we will have to functions here to lure initial message and to Lord more messages when

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.250
we click on the button at the top.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.820
So we're going to create a new function just to share the logic.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.390
So here,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.340
before use the fact we create a new function Lord messages and we will wrap it in use Call

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.370
back in advance to optimize it.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.790
And let's put this logic over here inside Lord messages.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.270
And don't erase this subscription.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.520
It is really important to unsubscribe from user fact as well.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.600
So now we have this child RG over here as a dependency let's edit.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.650
And whenever reload you messages,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.070
we also make sure that we unsubscribed from old messages and subscribed to the new updates

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.070
.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.780
So here,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.400
right before we get our new data,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.850
we gonna call message ref dot off to unsubscribe from the previous updates.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.380
All right,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.730
now,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.100
inside this user fact,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.120
we're gonna call Lord messages,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.320
and we will specify inside array of dependencies,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.810
and we're gonna remove chat I d.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.020
Because from now on,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.900
it's not Depart off this use effect.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.200
Okay,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.640
Good.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.280
Now what about limit?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.200
And what about Lord More functionality?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.790
Let's great new function next to Lord messages that we will call on lower more also lets

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.550
rapper in use call back.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.680
And what should we put inside inside?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.540
We will simply call Lord messages with our limit that we have inside the state.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.350
So now we need to specify Lord messages and limit as dependencies and that's it.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.220
That's all for that function.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.680
Now,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.450
inside lord messages we receive limit that we want to increase when we click on Lord More.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.180
So here we will have a limit.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.470
And when we try to new messages for our query builder,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.150
we can specify this property called limit to last.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.010
So the number off notes to include in this query and we're going to specify limit or

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.730
because we already have limited audible declared let's call it limit to lest and let's pass

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.570
it over here.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:08.270
And in case if we have no value at all legis pacify page size Just a small fullback over

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.660
here.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.570
And every time we lower a new portion off messages,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.610
we need to increase our current limit.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.960
Right?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.880
So when we click on this button,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.610
our next limit is going to be our current limit plus page size.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.830
So here we're gonna pour set limit,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.840
and then we're gonna reference previous,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.140
previous plus page size.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.440
Okay,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.240
now we need to define this bottom,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.500
and we need to put this unload more handler for this bottom.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.690
So here at the very bottom where we render our markup,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.150
we're gonna put the next logic.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.930
So we gotta ask if we have messages and messages Don't Length is greater or equal to our

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.280
page size Onley.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.270
Then we will display an other l I element inside we will put button and inside bottom we're

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.850
gonna pour lower more.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.470
Now let's add a few class names.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.840
So for this ally,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.130
we're gonna put a tax center margin top two and margin bottom to as well.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.970
And also for on click,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.430
we're gonna specify own lower more.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.690
And also we will put it with the green color,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.540
not red one.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.610
I don't like that one.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.160
All right,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.520
Good.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.550
Now let's take a look what we did.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.730
If we open our page right now,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.140
like me,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.510
refresh it one more time.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.450
We can see now we have Onley 15 messages and if I click on load more,

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.620
you can see that more messages have been loaded.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.330
So this is it.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.730
This is what is happening.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:48.160
So right now when we load our page initially we have our initial subscription Onley four

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.060
page size,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.440
which is currently 15.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.260
Then when we click on Lord More,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.680
this is being launched with our current limit that we increase and it is going to be

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.010
increased to 30 and we will unsubscribe from these updates and we're gonna subscribe to new

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.640
updates.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.210
So this is what is happening in the background.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.770
All right,

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.280
now,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.880
what about our scroll?

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.710
As you can see,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.840
it is pretty broken because when we lowered new messages.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.190
We beans crawled to the top every time.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.250
This is no good,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.250
so we need to somehow control it.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.540
Well,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.090
for that,

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.950
we need to use reference to get the actual element so we can manipulate its scroll

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.500
possession.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.170
For that,

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.060
Let's create new reference over here.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.330
And it is going to be,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.800
let's say,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.910
self ref with used ref hook.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.630
Ok,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.950
then we're gonna pass that reference to our were you l element.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.960
So reference is going to be self reference.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.140
And now let's start to manipulate it.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.200
So first of all,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.550
for our initial use effect,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.940
when we load our page initially,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.590
we want to scroll to the very bottom,

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.080
right?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:04.890
So here we're gonna specify note and we're gonna reference self ref dot current to get the

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.350
actual reference to our element.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.450
And here,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.850
right after we load our messages,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.930
we can pour node scroll top equals no scroll height.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.910
And it'll Lloyd's thing.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:24.190
I have ever the problem with this approach is that because this Lord messages is an

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:32.480
asynchronous operation and this is synchronous so this might be executed before this Lord

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.240
messages has done with its think so it is important to put it as any think operation for

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.640
that.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.850
We will wrap it around set time our and we're going to specify something like 200

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.750
milliseconds.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.720
So in this way,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.710
we ensure that this is being executed on Lee when Lord messages is done and when all

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.770
elements that we're trying to display are displayed on the page.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.310
All right,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.800
so now let's take a look.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.510
If I refresh the page,

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.570
I can see that I did not think,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.570
but I'm scroll to the bottom.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.070
Yes,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.190
I can see this.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.020
A little small delay off 200 milliseconds.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.930
But that's fine,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.320
right?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.630
There is nothing wrong with that.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.000
However,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.430
now I'm being scrolled to the bottom.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.020
Okay?

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:26.280
Our next approach is to actually keep this crow position when we click on Lord More.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.340
So we're not scrawled to the top.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:28.630
Well,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.070
for that inside Lord,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.660
more in the first place.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.840
Let's again reference our current elements.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.950
So note is going to be self ref current.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.800
Then before we click on on Lord More,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.010
we need to know the previous height off our scroll element off our scroll position.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.110
So when we lowered new elements,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.770
we get the new height and then we can subtract those values.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.050
So here we're gonna pour old height valuable.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.960
And here we're gonna pour node scroll height.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.490
All right,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.020
then,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.980
after below our messages,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.390
we're gonna call said Time out again to make our operation asynchronous again.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.180
With time out off 200 milliseconds and then inside,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.830
we're going to specify new height,

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.570
which is going to be no scroll height.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:22.700
And then we're going to specify node scroll top equals new height minus old height.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.370
All right,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:23.640
now,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.330
let's save it.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.900
Let's remove this pace and let's take a look.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.330
Now we're scroll to the bottom,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.440
and when I click on Lord More,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.710
you can see that this crow position is retained.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.420
Okay,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.490
so it looks pretty good.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.050
How are you?

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.150
There is one more case to handle.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.430
Whenever I write something in the chat,

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.370
let's say hello.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.020
You can see that I am not scroll to the bottom.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.470
So we need to fix that.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.000
And ideally,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.180
we want to make it something like this.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:57.920
So if we have scrawled more than 50% inside our chat and we type something,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.950
we want to be scroll to the bottom.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:00.570
However,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.110
let's say if we look for some old messages.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.910
And if we type something or someone else types,

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.610
we don't want to be scroll to the bottom.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.650
Right For that,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.930
we need to also define our logic For this reason.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.150
Here at the top,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.690
we're going to create a new function that will name sure scroll to bottom,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.310
and it will receive this self ref current.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.810
So here we're gonna put note,

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.900
and here we will put the next logic.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.440
And also we can specify second argument,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.710
which is going to be let's say threshold,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.010
which is going to be,

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.550
let's say,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.220
30% of by default.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.720
Okay,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.920
so here we're gonna calculate percentage off our scroll position,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.810
and then we're going to return the comparison.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:49.300
We're gonna turn the bull in value if our percentage that we define over here is greater

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.670
than threshold that was pacified.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.210
Okay,

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.350
so percentage is going to have the next logic.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.510
So first of all,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.570
we gonna multiply our value by 100%.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.570
Then we're gonna divide this value by no scroll height miners,

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.140
no client height,

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.130
and this logic will give us the percentage.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.490
And as a full back,

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.810
we're gonna provide just zero.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.350
Okay?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.790
So now we can use dysfunction to detect if we really need to scroll to the bottom if we

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.360
hate the threshold.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:22.920
Okay,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.360
so let me copy this and let's go to Lord messages and hear what we will do.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.230
Begin us pacify const again.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:38.340
Let's say node and then we're gonna reference self Ralf dark current and what it will do.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.610
We will put it right after we set messages.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:47.530
Then we're gonna ask if we should scroll to the bottom with our current node and let's keep

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.150
threshold as 30% Onley.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.830
Then we're gonna pour no scroll talk and then no scroll height,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.290
okay?

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.120
And actually,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.830
you know what?

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.040
We can put this note to the top to reuse it.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.550
OK,

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.250
like this.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.270
Now let's take a look.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.740
So let me load more messages.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.450
Let me scroll to the top.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.100
And right now,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.950
when I type a new message,

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.780
I am not rolled to the bottom.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.340
However,

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.150
if I scroll more than 30% and if I type hike,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.060
I can see that I'm being scroll to the bottom.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.750
So this is a guys.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.530
This is how we can handle pagination.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.080
And this is how we can control our scroll position.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.780
Okay,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.740
I guess it was not too confusing because for me,

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.910
at the first glance,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.200
it waas All right,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.140
so let's commit our changes.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.350
Let's pull to get everything,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:49.550
get commit and let's say at it pagination and control scroll position.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.870
Perfect.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.100
See you in the next one.
