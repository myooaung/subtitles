00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220
hi in this media will create context for currently opened chatroom using cues Context

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.290
Lecter package.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.600
Before we begin,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.620
let's explore how everything is going to be handled.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.660
Right now there is rooms context that robs the entire home page.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.650
Context data is chatroom list with real time subscription.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.480
It means that if anything changes in any off room context,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
value will be updated inside shadow GS rooms.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.910
Context is being consumed.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.810
So any update to any room will cause a surrender.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.650
Two currently open chat page,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.490
even though the AB date hasn't been related to it.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.530
Therefore,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.240
inside Chad Ogea s,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.980
we will provide a new context that we will name current room context and we're gonna pass

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.960
currently opens room data for these contexts.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.690
We gonna use use context selector.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.180
Imagine a situation when currently opened room name is updated.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.690
It will create a surrender for currently open room and values that we will pass to current

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.400
room context will also be obviated.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.300
There is a component that consumes current room context and it displays only description,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.150
not name,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.400
because off use context selector,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.980
that component will not be rendered.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.450
Changes will affect on Lee the component that displays name.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.550
Okay,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.850
let's put everything into practice.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.760
I already opened official get happy webpage for use context Selector package And if I

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.610
scroll down from installation part,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.930
I can see that I need to copy this command.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.850
So let's do it.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.240
Let's navigate back to code and inside Integrated Terminal I'm gonna execute it and let's

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.810
wait until it is installed.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.800
Perfect the packages there.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.000
Now let's run the app and let's not get back to the documentation.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.670
So from the usage part,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.480
we can see that it is actually no different from how we use normal create context.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.840
So lets navigate back to code.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.120
And here on their context,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.680
folder less great new file that we will name current room context.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.120
Dodgy.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.550
Yes,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.270
Here.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.680
We're gonna create current room context and we're gonna use create context,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.730
the one that comes from not from react.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.560
Let's converted Teoh a six mo jewel and from use context selector.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.130
All right,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.050
so next part is going to be to create the provider component.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.900
So let's put export const current room provider so it will receive Children and then also

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.890
it will receive data so it will carry some data that we will pass to this provider.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.640
So here we're gonna return current from Context Dar provider.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.320
And we're gonna poor Children there and for value.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.650
We gonna pause data,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.450
so provider component is going to be like a middle man.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.000
All right,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.740
So if we have our react,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.090
must begin scope.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.530
So let's import react from react or I d go.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.810
Now let's actually see how can we select some data from here?

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.420
So we need to use use context,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.250
selector.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.850
Then we need to provide context that we want to consume.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.130
And then we provide the Colback that will pique our value where argument is our current

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.670
state.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.070
So let's navigate a little bit down from here.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.610
We can see that we can actually use it like this.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.940
So let's copy this and let's put it here in current room context.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.880
So what we will do,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.240
we will turn it into our own custom hook.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.410
Let's import use context selector from the package itself,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.170
and then we're gonna turn it into a hook.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.450
So let's convert it to function.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.980
And instead of first name,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.480
we're gonna use use current room and let's also export it.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.250
And for this use current room,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.510
we will only pass selector.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.000
So let's pass selector here.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.410
And instead of person context,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.140
we gonna pour current room context and for selector,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.760
we're gonna provide selector.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.950
We already here.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.410
Now,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.180
let's not get back to our chat page.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.250
And here,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.820
instead of this empty brackets instead of react fragment,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.490
let's use this provider.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.090
So we're gonna put current room provider,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.210
and we need to pass data that we will put to this context.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.870
So let's put data And for data,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.220
we will create an object that we will name,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.910
Let's say current room data.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.390
So here we're gonna create this object,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.560
and here we're gonna pass next values.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.580
So from our current room,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.470
we're gonna peak name and description by destructing the values.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.800
And then we're gonna pass name and description to current from data that will will pass to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.590
D context.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.130
All right,

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.560
So if we save it and if we save everything here now,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.350
if we go back to our app,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.330
nothing actually will be changed.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.950
However,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.430
if let's say we go to chat top here,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.790
we're gonna use use current room hook that we created.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:24.290
Then let's maybe select a name and for selector we're gonna pass State and from state,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.950
we're gonna pick name or maybe not,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.380
state.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.100
Let's just put envy for value like this.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.760
And now instead of top,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.680
let's display this name from the context.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.370
All right,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.890
So if I say that,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.010
if I refresh,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.180
I can see Hello the room name that we passed to the contacts And if I switch,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.250
it will be changed.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.590
So this is it.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.390
This is how we can actually peak values from context.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.790
And it is also very important to note that these values that we pick from the state that we

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.530
pick from the context it is important to understand that we can select objects because

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.990
objects are compared by references.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.290
And if we opened the documentation for this package,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.530
if we scroll down to limitations,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.130
we can see that provider trigger renders Onley if the context value is preferentially

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.750
changed,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.720
so objects are preferentially changed.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.810
So we must be careful with that.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.310
We need to select only primitive types which object is not.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.950
And also,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.150
if we'll look inside limitations,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.670
we need to wrap our component around react,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.110
Mama.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:40.010
So let's also import mammal from react and let's wrap it around it like this.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.640
So now our value is memorized.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.440
And if something changes for this current from data,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.800
let's a description.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.900
And inside this top component,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.310
we only consume name.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.370
This component will not be updated when description will be changed.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.510
So this is it.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.140
One thing to point here is that,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.650
as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.770
if we consume rooms context inside this component,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.320
and if something changes,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.840
the whole component will be rendered.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.170
So including this chat top messages and chat bottom.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.020
But because we use mammal here,

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.480
Teoh,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.410
memorize our components.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:29.380
We significantly reduced the update tree so only this wrapping dips will be updated on

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.400
every change.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.400
Underlying components chat up messages in chat bottom will not be render.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.750
So this is it.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.930
This is the cave.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:38.780
It's off context.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.900
AP I Let's finish this video.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:50.390
So let's commit everything and let's put the next message created current room context with

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.280
use context selector.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.400
All right,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.840
see you in the next one
