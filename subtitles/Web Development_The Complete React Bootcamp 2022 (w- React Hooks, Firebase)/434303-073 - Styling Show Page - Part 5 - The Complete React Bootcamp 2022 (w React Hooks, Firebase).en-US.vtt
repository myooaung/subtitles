00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
Hey,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.840
welcome In this video we will finish creating the show page and verbal style all components

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.250
that we created inside the show page.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.080
Let's go.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.640
So,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.520
to style our components,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.620
we will use styled components.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.620
And to get CSS markup,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.410
we will use the Assets folder.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710
And inside we will find styling,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.940
show page components,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.820
toe txt.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.440
Here we confined all CSS markup that we will use.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.620
So we will go one by one was open our code and the first vile bubble do we will create show

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.900
styled doggy s.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.880
So let's copy all of that under pages.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:46.530
Let's great new file showed that styled dot gs Let's paste the mark up And here we will

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.000
import styled from styled components.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.770
All right,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.110
now,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.410
let's open show page itself.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.090
And here we can use this show pay dropper instead of just wrapping div.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.350
So we gonna put Show Page rapper and then we have no classes inside,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.150
but will use info block.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.800
An infant block is intended for these blocks of data.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.100
So for these DVD's,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.860
we will put in for block and we have no classes,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.400
So that's fine.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000
We are finished here.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.080
Let's move on,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.430
then we have show main data style.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.640
So let's copy all of these styles and let's create show main data styled GS.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.950
So under show,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.720

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.300
We will put all of that.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.850
And also we will import styled from styled components.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.070
All right,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.550
let's open show main data and let's see,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.350
what do we have?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.470
So first we have a main date.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.210
A rapper.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.650
So this is for the wrapping element.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.890
So main data rapper inside this component,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.530
we will have image.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.190
We will have text,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.360
side class.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.460
And this is for this Deve that drops all our text side.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.050
So we will pour text side over here Inside this text side,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.740
we have got summary class.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.820
So this is for dif where we insert our dangerous HTML.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.490
So it is going to be just summary.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.110
Then what do we have?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.830

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.590
No classes.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.930
So we are finished here.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.590
Let's go where next element next file is going to be details.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.900
So let's copy it.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.350
Let's close all of that.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.250
We will import styles from styled components and let's take a look.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.470
So let's open seasons and use our market.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.850
So first we have seasons Rapper.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.910

Then goes our last component,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.890
which is cast.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.770
