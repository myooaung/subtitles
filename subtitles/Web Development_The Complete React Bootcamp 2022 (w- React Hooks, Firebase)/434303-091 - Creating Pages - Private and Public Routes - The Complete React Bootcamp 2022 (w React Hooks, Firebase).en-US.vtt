00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hey,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.470
now we have firebase initialized inside our project.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.100
Let's start building the project itself.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.790
The first thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna open my terminal and I will execute and PM Run start

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.450
to start developing server.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.630
But right before I execute this comment,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450
I'm gonna create new file,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.930
which is dot e n v dot local and I will put it in the root directory and here rivals pacify

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.090
browser to none.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.650
This is to prevent and PM Ron start from starting the application instantly inside my

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.220
browser.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.140
So I really hate this behavior.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.340
If you do like it,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.050
don't do this browser.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.810
None thing.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.390
So now I'm gonna run this command and I need to manually go to browser and access local

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.230
host 3000.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.180
So here I will see the hello message that I specified inside Abdel Gs when risk unfolded

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.870
the project.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.360
Now what we need to do we need to define our pages at first.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.460
But we didn't initialize react rotor when risk unfolded the app so lets navigate to index

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.280
togs and here to initialize reactor will import browser rotor from react router dumb and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.120
then we need to wrap our app component around browser,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.150
rotary component.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.470
And now we are able to use it.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.470
Okay,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.920
good.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.630
Let's go.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.650
Teoh Abdel Gs and hear what routes we will define.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.420
Let's first use switch instead.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.060
Off this,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.500
def.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.530
So I'm gonna put switch from react ruder than inside the switch.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.930
People define route.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.450
And what routes should we put here?

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.050
Well,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.940
we will have a few routes to find,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.900
and one of them is signing page and the home page.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.700
And the thing is that we will not be able to access the home page until we are signed in to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.300
the APP.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.070
So we need to define some sort of a private trout that can be only access if we are signed

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.370
in.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.800
So what we're going to do the first thing people do it will create new folder on the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.150
resource reachable name pages.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.890
Here we will create two new components and that will represent our pages.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.470
First is going to be a sign in page sign and she s here.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.030
I will scaffold and you component with the snipper extension.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.410
And let's just for sign in just like that.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.370
Then I will create another component,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.660
Holmdel Gs and I will do exactly the same thing.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.480
And I will name a just home now How can we define these rows over here?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.000
We can put route and then we can put first sign in so this route is defined.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.090
But what about home?

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.300
How can we make it private for this will create another component.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.440
We will name it private route and it will imitate this route component that comes from

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.390
react Router.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.870
But it will be enhanced and it will check against some condition.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.570
So under sores,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:19.350
let's create new folder components Here we will put new file private route just like that.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.170
So it will imitate this route component.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.830
So how is pacify this route component?

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.360
What problems do we path?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.630
What Children do a path.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.650
So we need to specify path.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.430
So for signing it is going to be just signing.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.470
So now about private Rauer.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.730
So let's define how we're going to use it.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.900
So it is going to be private route inside.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.390
We need to pour a component or just Children that we want to render.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.190
It is going to be our home page just like that and for props.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.870
We need to also specified that we will render this component at just slash.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.470
Okay,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.550
now inside private route.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.550
We know that whatever we pass to this private traveled component as a props will be

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.640
actually kind of redirected to this route component.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.820
So here we're gonna d structure everything and put it inside.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.720
Let's say route props.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.280
The only proper that we need to get from it is the actual Children that we want to render.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.330
So let's d structure Children and everything else will be available under route props.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.250
And we need to pour a simple condition over here.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.260
Let's say so for now.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.050
Since we don't have any profile,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.640
let's just create the bull invaluable Let's say profile and set it to false.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.860
And now what we're going to do we're gonna ask if our profile is set to fools.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.000
If we don't have any profile,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.140
then we're going to return and you component that we haven't used before it is going to be

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.990
redirect,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.530
which also comes from react rotor package.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.900
And this redirect will basically redirected to specify pass.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.670
So it receives only one prop,

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.580
which is to and for this to will specify.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.460
So if we don't have any sign and data.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.810
If we don't have profile,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.520
we will redirect to signing.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.220
All right.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.120
Pretty simple.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.650
Now,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.490
if this condition takes no place,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.790
then we would normally use our component that we pass as Children.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.460
So instead of returning this def,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.510
we will simply return route from react rotor than four props.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.840
We're going to specify all props that we gather it from here.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.950
So we're gonna spread them over this route component with just this syntax and inside

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.450
verbal past Children just like that.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.150
And if we save it,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.000
let's check it out.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.910
If it actually worked now,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.170
if I will try and access slash a slash home page,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.410
I will be instantly redirected because we always have false condition.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.150
So it means that we always be redirected to the sign in page.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.680
So if I said it's too true now if I will try and access home page,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.580
I will be there.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.980
So this is it.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.600
This is how we can do the private route.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.660
And also,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.000
when we are signed in,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.150
we don't want to see the sign in page.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.190
We want to be redirected also to,

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.530
let's say,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.730
to our dashboard or to home page.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.020
So what we can do,

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.250
we're gonna create another component which we will name public crowd.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.860
So let's create public route.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.880
Don't Yes,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.130
and let's actually copy everything from private route.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.380
And here,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.250
let's rename private route to public route.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.110
And here the thing will be the next.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.750
So if we have profile,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.860
then we're going to be redirected to home page.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.770
In this way,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.340
if we are signed in,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.710
we will not be able to see the sign in page where will be instantly redirected to home.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.670
So the logic is kind of the same.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.420
But it is reversed now how we can actually is disposable crowd actually in the same manner

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.130
as we used our private I'll.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.130
So here,

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.490
instead of just route will poor public Rauer that we import from Components folder.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.890
Now we don't need this import from react router.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.860
Let's save it.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.140
And actually nothing will be changed because we don't have any data for profile.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.680
So that's basically it.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.890
That's how we are able to manage our private and public crowds in react router.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.900
Now let's commit our changes and finish this video,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.490
so we're gonna put get at everything,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:51.740
then we're gonna commit our message created public and private routes for right.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.750
In the next video,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.280
we will start building the sign in page.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.150
See you there.
