00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
Hey, first of all,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.540
I want to mention that this video

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.580
is only for Windows users.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.605
In this video, I would like to

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.995
address Git Bash appearance.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.975
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.930
If I launch Git Bash.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.495
I don't like the way it looks.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:21.690
I want to remove that mean W 64,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.805
I want to remove that entry B at,

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.275
in my machine name.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.150
I don't need all of that.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.370
This is totally optional,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.385
but it will make your developer experience

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.120
a little bit more pleasant.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.575
So let's change that.

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:38.825
What we have to do, we have to navigate

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.735
to get installation folder at first.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:46.970
So for me it is going to be C, Program Files, good.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.495
Inside this folder we want ETC.

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:55.535
And profile D here will look for a good prompt dot SH,

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.860
and we open it with any text editor.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm going to open it with Sublime Text.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.875
And you will see this.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.490
I know what is going to be completely confusing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.035
and we don't know what is going on here, but don't panic.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.135
We only want to remove them

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.520
or maybe replace them with something else.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.020
So first of all,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.064
to remove that title Ming W6

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:25.250
for we'll look for something with title, apparently.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.685
So this dollar sign title prefix

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.625
is exactly for Ming W 64.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.535
So we just remove it from here.

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:36.275
And we also remove the colon,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:37.790
but don't remove that

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.400
semicolon from here because this is part of

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.365
that color represented as this basically.

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:48.275
So here, let me put my nickname

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.995
with an arrow and let me save the file.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.505
Now, let me restart Git Bash.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.670
So again I go to Run window Git Bash.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.775
And now boom, I see my nickname and,

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:04.760
and I DO pretty cool right Now I want to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.090
remove all of that that I highlighted.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.585
So I look for EMS system.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.660
I just remove that line completely.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.620
Then I remove user at host name.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.100
And also what I would like to do,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.720
I would like to highlight current path,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.670
which is displayed over here.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.575
So if I navigate to see,

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:33.904
I have it like this, but I wanted to put it in brackets.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:38.780
So backslash w is current working directory.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.300
So I want to put it inside box brackets like that.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.820
Alright, and a class, what I wanted to do,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.430
I wanted to change the prompt from

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.165
the dollar sign to an arrow maybe.

00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:58.025
So here I look for this line.

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:02.885
Alright, prompt is going to be always an arrow.

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:06.035
I change it, I saved the file,

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:08.420
and now let's see the result.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.035
So again, I restart Git Bash.

00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:16.474
And now this is our final appearance.

00:03:16.474 --> 00:03:20.465
If we navigate to disk D,

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.655
we have it like that.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:25.040
Pretty cool. So again,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.690
this is totally optional and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.580
this is my personal preference because

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.450
I like simplicity and I like the way it looks.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.330
And for me from my point of view,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.420
it looks much, much better than it was before.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.720
It's totally up to you whether you needed or not.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.160
But that's it.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.125
This is what I wanted to address.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:47.400
See you in the next one.
