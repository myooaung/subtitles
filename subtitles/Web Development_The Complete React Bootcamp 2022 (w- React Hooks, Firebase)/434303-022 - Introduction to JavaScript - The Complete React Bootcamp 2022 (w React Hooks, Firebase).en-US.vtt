Hi, Welcome to JavaScript section.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.350
In this section we're gonna talk about

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.795
most common JavaScript syntax features.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.490
We will not cover the very,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.110
very basics because we will

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.255
understand all of that during the process,

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:13.935
we're going to attach more advanced

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.720
and more common patterns.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.910
We need to understand all of that

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.610
to feel comfortable during create development.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.825
Hope you're going to like it.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.040
See you in the next one.
