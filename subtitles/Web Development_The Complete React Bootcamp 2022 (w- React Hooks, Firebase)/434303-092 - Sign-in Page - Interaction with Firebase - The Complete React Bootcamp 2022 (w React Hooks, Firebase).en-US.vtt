00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Hey,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.250
welcome in this video,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.390
we will start building designing page.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.280
Let's go.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.420
Before we begin.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.130
I just want to mention that we're going to use the react suit.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.440
You.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.080
Why library that we've installed?

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.190
We're going to utilize it a lot.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.250
So please open this documentation on your next step,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.160
so you always have access to it.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.400
So go to home page,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.080
then click on components.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.320
And here on this page you can find all components that this library provides us west.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.140
It is very simple to use,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
and they all are mostly intuitive.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.210
So let's say if we go to button component from here on every company page,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.960
you can find a lot of different examples and use cases.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.640
And also,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940
if you click on showed the source,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.670
you confide how this component can be used in your coat.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.050
You can always copy and paste it.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.830
And also,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.680
if you only need to know what component receives as props,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.640
you can scroll down to the very bottom and you confide all possible props that can be

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.700
passed down to this particular component.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.420
All right,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480
so inside our code,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.000
when I will write this stuff,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.750
I will not reference It may be a few times,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.050
but most of the time,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.550
because it is better intuitive.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.850
I'm not gonna explain it.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.850
So if you still don't know what is going to happen,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.290
please navigated to this documentation.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.790
All right,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.240
so let's get started.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.670
So lets navigate to our code and let's open sign in page.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.340
And here we're going to start first,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.940
we will remove this def,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.100
and we will put container component from our suit.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.200
You might think that it is very similar to contend from bootstrap because it is container

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.970
have ever in this library.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.810
It is not.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.150
It just gives us the display off Flex.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.030
Then we're going to use grit.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.970
And in this library,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.150
great is pretty much the same as in Bootstrap.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.860
But unlike in Bootstrap,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.090
it has 24 column system.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.150
Unlike with boots,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.990
drop with 12 combs.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.620
All right,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.010
so inside grid,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.450
we have grow and inside row,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.740
we have column just like that.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.330
So our colon is going to be health off its max with on medium devices.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.140
So on very small devices,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.800
we're going to poor old 24 columns on medium and above.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.260
We're going to put 12 now,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.770
inside this column we're going to put panel component,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.210
and it basically will give us a few off patting.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.970
OK,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.870
so inside we're gonna put def.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.740
And inside this difficult define age to tag that will say,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.670
Welcome to chat Underneath we will put Pitak that will say,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.520
progressive chat platform four meal fights,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.060
something like that.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.660
All right,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.780
let's check it out.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.280
If I refresh the page,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.570
I can see this strange,

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.610
weird background.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.810
That's because I imported column from our suit Leap Carousel.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.920
I didn't want this.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.780
This is a little bit off tricky when you use outer intel Essence make sure imported from

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.050
just our suit.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.270
If I save it now,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.950
I can see that it actually worked.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.630
However,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.020
our text is not centered.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.910
We want to make it center so we can use one of our utility classes that we poor inside

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.500
utility,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.450
as here says,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.750
and they're almost like bootstrap,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.880
so we can define class name,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.350
text center and it will work.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.010
However,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.070
we can see that if we inspected,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.770
our component is not completely centered on large devices.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.240
However,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.880
on mobile,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.550
it's OK.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.080
That's because when we apply this 12 column system,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.000
our element is not,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.140
Let's say tender it.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.050
We need to apply.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.720
Offset.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.390
It is again very similar,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.710
like in Bootstrap.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.550
So for 12 columns we need to apply Offset off six columns before it.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.310
So we're gonna put empty offset off six columns.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.090
And right now our great element will be centered,

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.330
As you can see from this padding over here.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.030
All right.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.550
It looks good now under a Disney,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.250
if we're gonna put another def.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.770
And here we will define our buttons,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.150
signing with Google and sign in with Facebook.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.050
So first I'm gonna put button.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.060
Then,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.910
as props,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.850
I will pass.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.500
It is going to be a block button.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.440
It will take all with off its parent.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.450
Then I will put color,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.680
and I will set it to blue.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.050
And that's it for now.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.590
So inside this bottom,

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.750
I'm gonna pour Aiken component from our suit,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.050
and as I can,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.400
I'm going to specify I can prop four Facebook just like that.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.500
And then I will put a simple text,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.510
continue with Facebook,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.800
but capitalized and the same I will do for signing with Google.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.290
I will specify a color green.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.690
And instead of phrasebook,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.020
I can I'm gonna specify Google Aiken and then continue with Google just like that.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.350
Now what's take a look?

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.100
Okay,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.960
it seems fine,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.150
but we want to add some margin.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.370
So for Disney,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.470
if let's put class name and margin top three,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.820
something like that.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.760
OK,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.420
Looks good.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.380
Now we need to make it that centered vertically.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.870
Or maybe at some margin to the top elements.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.740
So it looks more nicer.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.490
So for this great component,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.300
we're going to define class name,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.130
and we're gonna put margin top page.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.490
So this is class that I defined in one off the utility files,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.500
so it just gives a lot off margin to to the elements.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.130
So if we inspect it as you can see,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.670
margin top gives us 150 peaks else.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.350
All right,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.750
so it looks good.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.260
Now,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.560
what about functionality?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.330
How we can actually manage our signing and finally start adding this Facebook and Google

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.010
science.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.800
So what do we need to do inside Firebase gs where we initialized our application?

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.020
We need to import off library from fire base.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.970
So here we're gonna import firebase off just like that.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.600
Then here under app,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.520
we're gonna export const in available,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.290
which will name just off and we will call app dot off and it will give us the object that

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.950
we can use to interact with fire base.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.580
So let's save it inside signing.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.480
We're gonna define our handlers for on click event for buttons.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.840
So we're gonna put first on,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.350
let's say Facebook sign in,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:07.870
and then I will do the same for Google on Google signing and their functionality is almost

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.650
the same.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.240
So I'm gonna create 1/3 function that I will call inside on Facebook signing and inside on

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.110
Google signing.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:24.450
So we will name it something like sign in with provider and provider as either Facebook or

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.010
Google.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.600
All right,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.020
so as an argument it will receive this provider and then we will do some think insight.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.890
So inside on Facebook,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.410
log in.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.620
We're going to call,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.930
sign in with provider and Rubble pass a provider will talk a bout provider in a moment and

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:50.100
here also signing with provider now how we can actually signing so inside signing with

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.860
provider,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:58.540
we can just type off and imported from our misc firebase file this off object that we got

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.700
from here If we just put dot from intelligence.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.850
We can see a lot off things happening over here.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.920
We can access current user.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.780
We can confirm reset password and different.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.160
If we just type signing,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.970
we can have different things here.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:18.160
We consign in with email and password with phone number with pope up with redirect.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.850
So a lot of things happening here we're interested in signing with pop up and if we call

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.430
this mounted inside,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.960
we need to pass the provider and it is going to be provided that we will receive as an

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.600
argument.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.220
So we will put it here.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.150
So what is this provider?

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.770
So this provider object we need to import from,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.520
Let's say,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.270
firebase library and it is static.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.550
So what we need to do here,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.610
we need to import fire base from firebase slash AP again,

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.870
it is important to import from firebase slash ap So here,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.790
as a provider,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:03.730
we're going to pass new firebase dot auth dot facebook off provider and we need to call it

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:09.010
it will return us and you provider object that we will pass as undocumented to dysfunction

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.720
and the same rebel do for Google signing.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.400
We're gonna put new firebase off,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.590
but this time Google off provider just like that.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.820
Now what's actually associate this?

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.430
Handlers with buttons.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:28.870
So for on click event for Facebook pattern we're gonna put on Facebook signing and for

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.380
Google,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.650
we're gonna put on click on Google,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.690
Sign in just like that.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.490
All right,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.260
Looks good.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.290
Now this signing with pop up if we however,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.470
it is a promise.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.810
So we need to await it.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:48.860
Lets convert our signing with provider to in a sink function and await this signing with

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.450
Pope up.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.950
And then let's put the results into result viable.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.360
And let's consul look and see.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.600
What do we receive,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:56.830
though,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.520
if I refresh the page I opened council,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.090
then I can see that responded with 400 Arkwright.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.740
That's fine.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.930
Let's click on Continue with Google,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.700
for example.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.250
All right,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.030
you can see that it actually doing something,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.810
and right now I can select one of my Google accounts.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.350
All right,

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.440
let's select mind of my accounts.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.590
And now you can see that I have result over here.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:24.610
So it is an object that has three different objects additional user info so we can see that

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.220
this is our new user.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.210
We can get email given name,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.730
different ideas.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.950
We can get picture if our email is verified.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.140
So this data comes from Google and you can see provider.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.930
I deace that to Google.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.590
Then we have credential,

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.150
different access tokens and then we have user object.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.840
So this user object represents currently signed in user.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.020
It is general.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.010
And from here we can understand whether our user logged in.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:54.770
We're not.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.420
We will talk about this user object in details in upcoming videos.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.210
So now what we can do We can actually go back to Firebase Weaken,

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.880
Go to authentication.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.920
Here we can reload our authentication.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.740
Let's say sign in database.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.940
And here we confine our email with provider when it was created and created User I d.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.460
So,

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.160
first of all,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.770
this is not a database.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.730
This is just like small database inside this authentication library.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.850
We still need to store our users inside database.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.320
This is just to track.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.130
How many users do we have signed in on inside our app or something?

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.610
All right,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:41.640
so now let's actually modify our code slightly and let's store our user inside database.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.770
So first of all,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.820
let me put,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.380
try,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:44.970
catch,

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:51.000
look over here because we work with promises and we want to make sure that we always handle

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.040
any others.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.360
And by the way,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.670
just to notify user that we currently signed in or if we have any errors,

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.650
we can use the alert component that again comes from our suit.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.320
So if we have any error,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.750
we gonna call alert,

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:12.000
and then if we put dot we can see we can have access to atter info and success and warning

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.710
messages.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.570
So let's put in for message.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.230
So as a first argument,

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.310
we will put error that message,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.880
and then we need to put the duration off this message off this alert message.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.790
So let's poor for seconds in specified in milliseconds.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.860
And if we are signed in,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.220
we're gonna put alert.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.610
Let's say success.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:39.480
And then we're gonna put signed in with again time out off four seconds.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.270
All right.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.110
Seems good.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.620
Now what we can do with that result.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.780
As you remember,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.050
we received an object.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.950
We received additional user info and also received user object.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:52.550
Now,

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:57.360
by checking if additional user info is your user,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.690
so if our user is that is currently being signed,

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.760
it is a new user will store it inside the database.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.920
So how we can do that?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.930
Let's navigate back to Firebase Thaci s here.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.500
We're gonna import another library,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:17.440
which is going to be firebase slash database to interact with the database and similar to

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.070
off.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:26.040
We're going to export const database ap dot database just like that.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.870
So under this database,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.310
valuable we can interact with database.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.230
Let's savor so from inside signing,

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.000
we gonna reference database,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.340
which we import from misc firebase.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.180
Then we're gonna put dot here.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.470
We need to specify reference,

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:47.850
which is basically path in our database on the ritual store our data.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:55.100
So we're gonna store our user information under slash profiles slash user i d.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.310
So let's open string interpolation.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.660
And as user I d.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.970
We gonna reference user dot We can have email display,

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.850
name delayed and a lot of other things related to this user.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.570
But we're interested in user I d.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.780
So this user I d is going to be the same as this user.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.220
I d inside authentication library.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.910
So it is going to be like we create a new user.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:26.170
It has been added to authentication the user I d is automatically generated,

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.940
and then we will use this user I d to store the user inside the database.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.340
All right,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.410
so now when we have the reference,

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.700
we can put another dot And from here,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.450
we need to call SAT method.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.540
And as you can see from description,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.250
it writes data to this database location.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.110
So if I call it here,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.970
we will store an object because we have adjacent based data ways.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.700
So our object is going to look like this.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:57.630
We will have name and name is going to be user dot display name.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.690
Then we will also have created at which will say,

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.410
when the account has been created.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:11.560
So to put let's a proper time stamp to our database again needs to use some static.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.810
Let's see property that comes from Firebase Library.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:22.780
So we get a report firebase dot database dot server value dot time stamp,

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:28.120
and it will put sanitized time stamp to our database.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.850
All right,

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.780
so this dot said also returns that promise.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.980
So whenever we do anything with database or whatever,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.500
we interact with anything.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.290
Most likely,

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.650
we're going to interact with promises.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:45.830
So that's why we need to await it and everything will be catched by this catch Block and

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.730
user will be notified.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.230
All right,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.750
let's save all of that because it seems like,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.740
really a lot.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.400
Now let's click on,

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.640
Continue with Google.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.910
Let's select my email and now I'm signed in.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.610
But it is actually a really strange.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.410
That's probably because I have this account already added Here,

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.100
maybe you let me deal it this account.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.840
And now let's try one more time because we need to receive a matter.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.330
All right,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.960
so we click on,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.120
continue with Google,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.610
then we're going to select our account again.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.180
And now we have permission denied permission tonight.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.750
And we have this not in for Let's put dot at her message.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:31.240
But the thing is that we have permission denied and this is because if we open our database

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.240
,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.740
all right,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.250
let's go and click,

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.390
create database.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.840
Then we go to rules.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.990
And here we created the locked database by default.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.240
So whatever we tried to do with the database,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.370
we will have this permission tonight because,

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.030
as you can see,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:52.360
we have read and rights permission set to falls for all off our database.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.850
So to avoid that what we can do here right before we said this rules,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.250
we're gonna say that for profiles,

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.350
and we need to defy let's say,

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.620
esque EBA for our security rules.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:11.170
And it's not that standard way to define something with security,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.880
but it just takes time to get accustomed to.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.500
Trust me,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.230
it is very easy to work with.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.790
So we have our profiles path.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.270
We just need to follow the past.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:25.270
So we store our data under profiles slash user i d.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.160
So we're gonna put it as an object.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.760
So we have profiles,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.180
then we're gonna need to put a key.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.620
And because it is going to be something dynamic that will change,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.540
we're gonna put a dollar sign,

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.310
and then we can put something like user,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.780
i d.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.440
This is just to reference it inside nested object.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.800
Let me explain what I mean.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.210
So under this past,

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.100
we're gonna open again another object,

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.200
and inside,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.630
we're gonna put another key which is going to be dot treat and dot Right?

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.920
Exactly the same as we have over here.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.430
So for dot Read what we are going to do.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.090
We're gonna reference if this user i d.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.440
That we received from here.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.070
Now it goes as available.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.060
We can reference it inside this scope.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.500
Let's say that I just highlighted.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:23.020
So if user I d which is that one equals off and off over here in this let's say context off

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:30.840
rules is a global valuable that we can access so we can read data from profiles slash user

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.430
i d.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.970
Only one user i d.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.980
That we could try to access equals us dot user i d.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.760
So it means,

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.190
actually,

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.460
only the owner off this document.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.450
Only the actual user can read its own data.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.750
Any other person,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.270
any other user will get access denied.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.820
All right,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.150
that's how we define the rules for don't treat.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:57.550
So let's copy it and we will apply the same for dot Right?

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.290
So what is going to happen here?

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.770
How it will understand the two year signed in Well,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.560
let's get back to the code when we call this sign in with pop Pop.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.800
Now our user is signed in internally to firebase services.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.900
So when we try to access database afterwards,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:24.050
firebase will pick it up and this user I d will be known to the database and it is going to

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.850
be this auth dot user i d.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.450
And then we will check it against the path that we write to.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.340
Now let's click on Publish.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.080
Okay,

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.500
Rules published.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.970
Now let's get back to the database and actually,

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:38.570
let's copy,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.700
Visit ALS and let's paste them,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.550
too.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.320
Database rules to Jason.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.480
So they're always there.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:45.990
Right?

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.220
Then go back to authentication.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.400
Let's delete this user and let's start over.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.370
So I'm going to click on,

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.610
Continue with Google.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.280
I'm gonna select my account,

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.330
and now I don't have any error.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:58.870
Now,

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.050
I'm signed in.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.550
So now if I navigate back to database,

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.450
I can see that I have data.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:11.420
I have profiles and that I have user I d exactly the same as we have here.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.940
So this is how it works with fire base.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.380
All right,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.130
so if we expand it,

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.860
we can see we have our name,

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.690
which is chilled 16 which is my name on Google account.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.430
And then we have created at which is milliseconds stored internally by fire base.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.260
All right,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.220
so now we created the user and we managed our signing page.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.950
Congrats.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.680
I guess it wasn't too complicated for you.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.570
because there are lots of things to cover here.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.530
Sign inflow than this database than security rules.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.470
And everything goes at once.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.710
I know that's hard,

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.950
but trust me,

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:54.180
just let it go after one hour or maybe one day when you will take a look on all of that one

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.840
more time.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.520
It will not be that complicated.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.180
All right,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.740
so let's commit our changes and finish this video,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.740
so we're gonna pull,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.950
get at everything,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:13.090
and then we're gonna commit something like edit sign in page and sign and with facebook

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.110
slash Go girl.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.660
All right.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.310
Perfect.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.370
In the next video,

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.150
we'll continue our talk with authentication,

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.590
and we will start our user management.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.490
See you that.
