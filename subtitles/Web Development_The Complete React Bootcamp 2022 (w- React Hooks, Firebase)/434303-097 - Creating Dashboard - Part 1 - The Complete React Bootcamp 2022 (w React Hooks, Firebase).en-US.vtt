00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
Hey,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.700
welcome in this redeemable.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.920
Continue building our sidebar and we will start building exactly Dashboard.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.820
Let's go.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.340
So first,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.610
let's open index togs And here instead of visit if we're going to use Drover elements.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.720
So since we don't have any rapper because we defined it it inside the airport toggle these

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.280
Drover,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.650
we will use react fragment insight like this.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.200
So our job,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.790
er elements will be drover dot Not titled over dot Heather Inside header.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.570
We will get drover dot title and because off V s code bark with react fragment Now I have

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.870
this data duplication,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.720
but that's fine.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.440
So next you had er we will have drover dot body And then we will have drover dot footer

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.520
just like that.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.530
So inside body were going to display user data.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.240
So here we're gonna port.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.530
Let's say h three element and then we will say,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.130
Hey,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.940
user or we have profile.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.830
We have profiled dot name.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.910
So this profile will be our profile that we get from use profile hook.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.200
That is our context.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.360
So we're gonna call use profile and I don't have intelligence.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.980
So let's open profile context.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.840
And now,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.150
if I put intelligence it will be important for me.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.770
All right.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.090
Good.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.120
So inside body,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.250
we have text displayed inside title.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.040
We gonna pull just dashboard and inside footer,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.580
we will add Sign out button.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.720
So let's add button element.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.000
It is going to be a bloke element.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.500
It will have red color and for unclipped we will specify on Sign out and we will poured

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.940
Sign out as text.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.510
All right,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.800
so maybe let's just remove one click for now and let's delete this H three tack at the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.310
bottom.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.300
Let's check it out.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.860
What do we have as a result?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.380
We're right.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.810
Perfect.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.760
So now we have hate.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.250
She looks 16 which is our user name.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.110
And then we have signed out button,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500
but it doesn't have any functionality yet,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.960
so let's add it.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.630
Well,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.980
when we sign out from the application,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.080
we want you also close this model window.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.520
But this close function recites inside Data Board Togo.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.500
So I proposed to define one sign out,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.760
function inside dashboard togo,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.450
and then pass it down to dashboard component.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.370
So here we gonna put const on sign out.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.210
And because we have this is open state over here,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.900
every time we open and close it every time.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.990
We will have a new copy off this on sign out function.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.780
So we want to keep this copy.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.650
We want to you memorize it.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.150
So we're gonna use use call back in advance and inside were going to put the next logic.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.760
We need to call on Sign out,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.670
which is available on the oath.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.350
Object?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.940
Oh,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.890
not sign out.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.350
Just sign out.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.760
And that's it.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.580
That will completely sign out.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.840
Our current user.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.430
Everything is managed by fire base.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.950
Then we need to put alert,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.150
which is going to be an in for alert.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.310
We will say,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.620
signed out.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.140
It will last four seconds and then we will close the Drover as well.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.090
So because it comes from our custom hook,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.190
we needed to pass it as a dependency.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.280
But that's fine.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.760
Clothes function is memorized inside use model state because we put it inside.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.200
Use CLO back as you remember.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.650
No,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.810
Let's pass on.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.510
Sign out to dashboard and inside dashboard.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.080
Let's consume it on.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.180
Sign out.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.240
Is it capitalized?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.690
Yes,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.460
it is.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.760
So four on.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.650
Sign out.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.250
Click.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.120
We're gonna put on sign out function.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.920
All right?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.820
It seems fine.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.160
Now let's check it out.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.950
If we open our their board,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.180
if we click on sign out right now,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.980
we are signed out.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.610
And the potential question could be why we are redirected to sign in page.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.150
That's because inside our context,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.660
we have this on off state changed.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.350
So when we sign out because it is a real time subscription,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.090
firebase will pick it up.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.700
It will sign out the user,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.850
and this Colback will be fired.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.280
So when we don't have off object,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.150
we call set profile to know.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.370
And when we have set profile now or undefined,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.500
if we look inside private route,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.890
we redirect user to sign in.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.930
So this is exactly what happening.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.050
So now we have the complete signing and sign out system,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.030
which works seamlessly.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.670
All right,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.770
so to check that everything works.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.350
Fine.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.250
Let's sign in one more time and I'm gonna again select exactly the same account.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.360
Now I'm redirected.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.870
I am signed in and again,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.910
I have hate.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.050
She looks 16.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.470
So perfect.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.570
It works as it must work.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.180
Now let's commit our changes and finish this video.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.510
We gonna port,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.850
get at everything,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.220
then get commit.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:40.090
Started building a dashboard and it sign out button and display user name.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.500
All right,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.850
See you in the next one.
