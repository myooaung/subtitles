00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
hello.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.320
In this video,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.310
we will manage rial time presence in our application with fire Base.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.830
It is pretty easy to do.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.110
Let's find out how we can handle this.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.350
Let's go to Google and let's just type firebase riel time presence.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.560
Then we can go to the first link built presence and cloud fire store.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.090
And here we already have a solution using presence in real time database.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.920
So we need to just caught be this snippet of code and then use it in our application.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.240
So let's first copy is offline and online for database valuables and let's navigate to

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.560
profile context.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.340
This is the place where we will handle everything,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.240
because here we can get access to authentication.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.370
Object with real time subscription.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.890
All right,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.030
so let's put despite a bles here at the top,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.020
and let's replace Var with Constant.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.360
Now let's take a look.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.470
What do we need to do next?

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.300
So we need to guess Database raft to info connected.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.290
So this is like a general way in database path that we can access and we can get real time

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.840
presence off currently signed in user.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.850
So let's just copy it.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.890
Or maybe let's copy all of that like this,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.530
and let's placed it here inside.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.150
If authentication object,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.660
Denver will perform our real time presence management.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.200
So here we need to get reference to interconnected instead of Firebase database.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.940
Let's use later base that we got inside misc.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.660
Firebase.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.610
So then we get reference to infer connected on value what's converted to a narrow function

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.230
than we receive.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.630
Snap.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.170
Sure,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.700
if snapshot that value is false.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.640
Let's poor and three people equality than user status.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.680
Database ref.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.240
So let's take a look.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.850
This is that valuable that we can copy.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.810
And this is the place literal store our status inside our real time database.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.710
So what we need to do,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.410
because it is going to be a real time subscription,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.950
we need to also unsubscribe from it in the future.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.270
So let's put it here inside Yousef act as a new viable we're gonna name it user startles

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.420
database rough.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.710
Let's remove database and let's just put user status,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.150
ref.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.450
Then we will assign user starters ref to database Ralf status and you idea,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.650
Let's put it here at the top,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.190
just like that,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.360
and instead off you idea.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.870
Let's use off your i d and let's replace it with the string interpolation.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.600
So we will get both object dot your i d like this then,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.550
because it is a subscription.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.380
When we are looked off.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.340
Let's check if we have user status.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.850
Ref,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.100
If we have it done,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.690
we're gonna unsubscribe from it.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.660
And the same we will do for our cleanup function over hero user studies.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.550
Rough off.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.100
Okay,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.950
perfect.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.050
Now let's manage this part.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.330
So let's remove all of the comments.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.010
Let's remove all of that.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.230
And here we're gonna pour user started strap on.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.550
Disconnect is offline for database,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.760
then function.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.420
Let's converted to an adult function.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.640
Then let's replace it with your status.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.150
Ref.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.860
Sad is online for database,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.350
so this is basically it.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.700
Now let's take a look.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.840
We have fire.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.560
Base is not defined.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.540
Let's take a look.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.770
Firebase database.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.300
All right.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.770
Less import fire base from firebase app so we can get access to server value.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.700
Times temp.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.710
Let's save it and let's take a look.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.290
Now,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.050
if we are inside,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.910
we get permission denied.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.010
That's interesting.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.460
That's probably something with security rules.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.650
So let's take a look where we write our data.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.220
Uh huh.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.850
exactly.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.880
So we write our data to slash status off you I d.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.700
So let's again right security rules for this past inside database.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.070
So we have status.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.330
So let's call it be this path.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.990
We will do it like this.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.050
So here we will have user I d.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.720
And then we will be able to write to these place on Lee.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.200
If we have off,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.860
I d equals to use their ideas so licious Copy this logic and paste it over here like this.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.060
Now let's save it and let's take a look if it actually worked.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.520
If I to fresh my app,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.820
I can see now I have no warnings.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.650
So let's call it P vessels and let's sing cries them with our local data like this.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.670
Now let's navigate back to data and let's check it out here.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.020
Inside our database,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.000
we have New Path,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.350
which is studies that I have my user,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.880
I d.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.010
And then I have less change and stayed online.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.590
Now let's take a look.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.130
If I sign out from the application,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.450
I have stayed online,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.170
so this is because when we sign out,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.960
we didn't put an geologic for our database,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.750
so Onley when we log in.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.650
Let me continue with Google and let me select my account.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.000
Okay?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.970
I'm signed in.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.520
You can see that last change has been changed.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.050
You saw that fleet shot,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.400
right?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.920
So what is happening?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.750
That it actually works when we sign in,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.240
but not when we sign out.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.370
And the thing is because we set our security rules in that way,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.200
we can write and read on Lee when we have off you I d.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.820
So when we log our from our application when we sign out,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.260
this author object will be set to now,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.090
so this will be fired.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.620
And if we put our logic over here when we sign out in this way,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.260
we will get permission tonight because at the time,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.720
when we will try to right to the database of object will be set to now.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.890
The solution here is just to go to dashboard.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.670
Let's go to Dashboard Tuggle here.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.350
We need to pour this logic.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.850
So right before we sign out Mobile right to database.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.520
So we still have access to our security rules.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.570
So we can still have access to the author object.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.240
And only then we are going to sign out our user.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.420
So what logic should be put here exactly the same as we pour here inside user starters.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.840
Refs,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.310
That is.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.380
Ah,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.560
flying for data ways.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.950
So what I proposed to you from here on,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.490
we're gonna export CONST.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.950
Is a flying for database.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.370
Then we're going to copy this logic.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.920
Then right before we sign out from our application,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.430
we're gonna paste this logic.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.740
Then we're gonna import is offline for database.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.800
Then we're gonna pour database Dodds Ralf,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.190
Then we're gonna put status than slash.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.940
Then let's change quotes and pique our current user.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.560
I d Then we're gonna pour set,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.620
and then we're gonna set is a flying for database something like this on Lee,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.590
then because it is a promise.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.070
So let's could done over here.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.980
Only then we will sign out our user.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.760
We're gonna alert our user,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.350
and we're gonna close our application.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.440
And in case off any error,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.100
we're also gonna notify our user,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.140
but better.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.260
And we're gonna say better dot message.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.880
All right,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.570
now,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.480
let's actually take a look.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.110
So let me refresh the app just in case.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.130
Let's take a look inside database.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.310
So now we have status online,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.180
and if I go to sign out,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.250
I'm signed out.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.240
And now I have stayed off line.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.000
So pretty cool right now if I signing again,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.470
I'm signed in and status has been changed.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.410
And now if I close my application,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.640
if I close my tab,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.280
I can see state is a flying,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.370
so it actually works.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.570
And this is it.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.400
So this is how it can be handled with fire raise.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.310
It was pretty easy,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.700
right?

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.830
The only thing here I want to do is I want to actually unsubscribe also from referenced or

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.750
info dot connect when we are signed off.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:04.180
So let's pour off when we are signed our And also we're gonna put the same for cleanup

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.590
function just in case.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:05.820
So,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.280
in this way,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.650
we handle all real time subscriptions and everything works fine.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.920
Well,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.400
that's it for this video.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.310
So let's commit.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.560
Our change is gonna add everything to the stage state.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.530
And then I will commit everything with message.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.890
I'll say a riel time presence,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.250
listener for a user.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:24.940
Perfect.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.930
In the next video,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:31.610
we're going to display a real time presence for users inside chat window.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.340
See you there
