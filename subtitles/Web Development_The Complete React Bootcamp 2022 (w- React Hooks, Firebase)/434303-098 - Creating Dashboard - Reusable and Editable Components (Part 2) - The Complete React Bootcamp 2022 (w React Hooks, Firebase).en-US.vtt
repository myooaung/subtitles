00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
Hey,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.490
welcome in this leader were continue to build that pork and verbal create a component that

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.820
we will reuse multiple times across our application in a few places.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.700
So it is going to be an input with the two buttons that while I was too edited.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.870
So when we save it,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.190
we actually update data inside the database.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.850
Let's go.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.640
So first,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.450
what I propose is to create the actual component.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.030
So under components,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.550
let's create new file creditable in port for now.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.800
Let it be empty.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190
Let's just put hello over here.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.130
Let's first define how we're going to use it.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.380
Let's open that word file here under Hey,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.270
profile name.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.760
Let's put divider from our suit.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.350
And then let's define Edita ble import.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.520
So what?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.580
Props should re pass insight.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.550
So first of all,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.040
we're going to pass initial value,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.490
which will be sad to the input.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.050
So let's put initial value,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.350
which is going to be profile dark name.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.330
All right,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.730
then we also need to define on safe function and that will be fired when we will save the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.200
input.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.970
So let's put on safe and let's define it over here.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
So we're gonna put on safe and this callback function,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.160
it will receive the same value as an argument.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.650
So let's put new data and for our let's leave this function empty.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.670
Also,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.600
we wanted to report maybe some label in front of the input,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.680
so we will have an option to pass a reactive component as a prop to the edible ample

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.360
component.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
So let's define something like age six.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.370
Maybe,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.280
let's put it is going to be Nick name and class name is going to be margin bottom to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.300
because we want to add some space between our label and between the actual input.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.080
And also we can pass other props that will be redirected Judy Input element.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.770
So maybe we can also pass something like name,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.030
which is going to be,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.850
in our case,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.550
nickname.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.800
So what is going to be input with our nickname that we will be able to add it?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.290
All right,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.770
Cool.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.200
So let's open our component and let's start building.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.860
So first we have initial value.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.750
I worked one of the main props.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.940
Then we will destructor on safe venerable also have label,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.360
which is going to be this age six,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.560
and there is a chance and that this label will not be passed.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.420
So let's put now VT fold and then also some other things,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.930
like placeholder.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.850
Maybe so.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.380
Let's poor placeholder.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.180
And by default,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.230
it will be said,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.390
Choose something like right,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.060
Your value.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.710
All right.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.730
And then also,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.870
what I propose is to poured a prop that will represent our empty message when someone tries

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.450
to save our input and it is empty so we can put like a global value that will say that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.550
input is empty.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.450
But what if we want to customize it?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.900
So let's also pass it as a prop empty message.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.870
And by default,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.320
if it is not specified in props,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.930
we will say that it is going to be in court,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.720
his empty all right,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.640
and any other prop is going to be our input props.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.410
All right,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.390
so for this live what we're going to do So here,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.200
right before the actual import element,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.470
we will port label.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.440
All right,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.090
then we will pour input that comes from our suit.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.890
So for this input,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.560
at the very first prop,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.710
we will pass our input crops,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.880
and we gonna overwrite a few off them.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.250
So we're gonna overwrite placeholder,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.990
which is going to be this place holder from props.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.100
Then we will also have other things that we will manage inside this component,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.390
such as its internal state.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.110
So when we're going to edit it,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.270
we will manage everything from here.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.750
So let's put it here in advance.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.680
So we're gonna define new state,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.110
which is going to be,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.870
let's say,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.630
just input and then set in port by default initial value.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.830
It is going to be our initial value that we pass over here.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.940
So let's put initial value.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.710
All right,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.740
so then we have own change handler that we need to specify.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.310
So let's pour on input change.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.950
So normally,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.140
as you remember,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.280
it receives an event object.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.730
But on our suit,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.320
it is slightly different as the first argument for on change event.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.620
So if I put unchanged over here,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.140
if I hover on it,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.810
you can see that first argument goes value.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.570
So it is just made for us to be more user friendly,

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.940
so we will have value instead,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.330
off referencing even target dot value.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.320
So here,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.130
we're gonna put also use call back because we will not have any dependency and we want to

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.090
optimize it in advance from here.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.490
Bubble call only set input to her value like this.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.980
And for these on change,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.870
we're going to pour on import change,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.750
all right.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.760
And also,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.620
don't forget to associate the actual value with our input,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.250
and we're almost done here.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.710
Now,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.150
we also want to make our input edit herbal.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.120
So it is going to be just a bullion value that will indicate So we're gonna create his

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.900
creditable state is a desirable and by default,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.480
it will be set to false.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.110
All right,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.090
so this input will be disabled when we have is creditable,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.880
set to false.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.320
So when is edible such the true?

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.000
We will be able to manage our inquiry.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.170
So let's create actual button that will indicate that So let's poor input group will not

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.720
put just button because we will have the two buttons inside our import either close or edit

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.720
.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.710
So we're gonna put input group to make it look groped,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.140
you know?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.670
So input group in button and inside this button,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.150
we're going to put I can and this I come will be the next.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.620
So if our input is going to be edible,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.000
venerable display close button.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.230
So otherwise,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.120
when we see the actual input and we don't intend to edit it,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.320
we will receive added to So this is just an icon with,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.650
like,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.280
pencils,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.840
so So we can see that we can added it.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.230
All right,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.670
so for this on click button,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:03.270
we're going to pour on edit click and this unedited click we will define over here.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.760
So on edit Click also will quote it around,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.630
use call back in advance because we will have no dependencies or actually with you.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.940
But it doesn't matter,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.550
Corneau.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.810
So we're gonna put Set is creditable to reverse value off our current state.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.970
So we will call this function which will reverse the bowling value.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.820
And then also,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.300
we want to make sure that if we click on cancel,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.400
we get back to the initial state.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.120
So we want to also call set input and just in case,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.850
set it back to initial value.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.680
So now it appears as a dependency.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.090
So let's put it here.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.740
And let's actually say with and see what is going on here.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.390
All right,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.690
Cool.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.800
So now we have it like this,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.120
and it looks almost cool,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.670
but it seems like I'm a something.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.120
Oh,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.500
yeah,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.090
actually,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.700
because we use input group,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.520
we need to wrap it around Input group.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.420
That's my bad.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.330
So important group.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.310
And I'm gonna put this at the end like that.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.800
Now,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.900
let's take a look.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.770
All right,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.960
So now it looks good.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.960
I can't add it input right now,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.350
because is edible such to fall.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.410
So when I click on this button now,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.290
I will be able to add it.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.000
This button.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.250
And as you can see,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.100
when I click on this button,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.400
the on edit click function will be fired.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.340
So if we don't have this set input initial value when I click on this button,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.930
it will not be re set to the default value.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.470
So we want to make sure that it is always initial if we cancel it.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.010
All right.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.580
So what else do we need to do?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:51.050
We need to define another bottle which will be displayed when we actually click on edit.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.770
So we are able to savor here.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.030
What?

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.140
We're going to pour.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.010
We're going to pour.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.790
If our import is creditable,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.430
then we're going to render another input group bottom.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.280
Let's just copy it and put over here.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.940
So for on click,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.350
we're going to put on safe click.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.570
It's not going to be the same on Save that.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.100
We pass as a prop.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.090
We're gonna define another on safe click over here.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.190
For now.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.280
Let it be like that.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:21.700
So,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700
for this button,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.200
what we're going to his passive fireable change.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.040
I can I can is going to be a static Aiken.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.240
And this I can is if I remember it is check.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.310
Let's take a look.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.910
All right,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.330
Go.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:35.960
Yes,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.480
it is.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:36.890
Check.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.150
So it seems like we have the markup.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.870
Let's actually define the functionality for on safe click.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.820
So what we're going to do here?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.130
First,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.600
we're gonna do a very primitive validation.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:49.900
First,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.820
we're going to get the trimmed value to avoid unnecessary spaces around our text.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.340
So let's put trimmed value and it is going to be input dot trim.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.940
OK,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:08.320
then we're gonna check if our trimmed value is going to be just an empty space.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.150
Then we're going to alert was pacified.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.730
Empty message as a prop.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:19.880
We can put this empty message over here and let's put time out off four seconds.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.670
All right.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.180
Then at the end,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.830
we're going to put Set is creditable to falls because when we click on safe,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.780
we want to make it not creditable like it was before.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.220
And now here,

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.310
we're gonna check against one more.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.990
Think it is going to be if trimmed is not going to be our initial value.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:48.010
So we're going to check if we actually edit something and our value is different Onley,

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:54.700
then we're gonna call our own safe call back that we specify here inside dashboard.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.230
So it is going to be in a sink function.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.710
So let's pacify it,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.860
since it is going to be facing it is going to be a promise,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.670
so we need to await it.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:11.650
So let's pour a sink and let's pour a weight on safe that we pass here.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.410
And as you remember,

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.000
this callback will receive new data as an argument.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.280
So here we need to pass our actual input.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.520
So let's poor not input or maybe trimmed to value,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.400
because we don't want to put it with the just unnecessary spaces around it.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.370
All right,

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.210
so now let's check it out.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.000
And here,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.340
let's come sold out.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.750
Look,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.030
New data to see if it actually worked.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.070
Now it seems pretty finished.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.870
Maybe in the future we will adjust it a little bit to fit our requirements.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.630
But for now,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.400
it looks good.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.220
Let's open our dashboard.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.180
Let's open,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.910
Consul,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.450
and let's take a look.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.440
So now if I edit it,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.580
if I cancel,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.750
everything is good.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.970
So if I again click on safe,

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.280
nothing changes.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.070
And we don't have this call back on safe fired.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.290
So if I change it and if I save it now,

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:12.590
I have the new value that is being consul locked from this on safe handler.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.690
So actually it worked.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.550
And I guess we are done here in the next video.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.810
We will actually apply some functionality to this component,

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.880
or maybe around this component.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.720
So we update our riel nickname.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.550
But for now,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.380
let's end this video and let's commit our changes.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.760
So I'm gonna put created reusable,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.320
creditable input.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.860
All right,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.640
Perfect.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.970
See you in the next one.
